- en: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are complex topics, and adding
    such features to applications has historically required a lot of processing power,
    not to mention tremendous amounts of learning. The introduction of Microsoft Cognitive
    Services gives developers the possibility to add these features with ease. It
    allows us to make smarter and more human-like applications.

- en: This book aims to teach you how to utilize the APIs from Microsoft Cognitive
    Services. You will learn what each API has to offer and how you can add it to
    your application. You will see what the different API calls expect in terms of
    input data and what you can expect in return. Most of the APIs in this book are
    covered with both theory and practical examples.
