- en: Almost every company nowadays is either using or trying to use AI/ML in some
    way, especially with the recent revolutions regarding generative AI. While AI/ML
    research is undoubtedly complex, what is often more complex is actually building
    and running applications that use AI/ML effectively. This book teaches you how
    to successfully design and run AI/ML workloads, based on years of experience implementing
    large-scale and highly complex AI/ML projects at some of the world’s leading technology
    companies.

    of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), as well as general cloud
    computing concepts. This is followed by an overview of Google Cloud, including
    the Google Cloud products related to AI/ML and examples of their intended use
    cases.

    and model development life-cycle. Each chapter covers an important stage in the
    life-cycle. You will not only learn those concepts but will put them into action
    in the practical exercises that accompany each chapter. The process begins with
    procuring and preparing data and moves on to training ML models. Then, we will
    deploy the models and get inferences from them. You will also learn about monitoring
    and updating models after deployment to ensure that they continue to provide the
    best possible results. Additionally, you will automate all of those steps by building
    an end-to-end MLOps solution.

    life-cycle but also covers important topics in implementing and managing machine-learning
    solutions at enterprise scale. We will dive into considerations such as privacy,
    compliance, ethics, and many other topics that are necessary to understand for
    running ML solutions in a real business context.

- en: By the end of this book, you will possess advanced knowledge of cloud computing,
    Google Cloud, AI/ML, and generative AI. You will have built complex projects,
    solutions, and models, addressing real-world business use cases, and have learned
    common challenges that companies often run into when building AI/ML solutions,
    as well as how to address those challenges, based on many years of experience
    on some of the industry’s largest and most complex AI/ML systems and projects.
    You will also have learned and implemented important solution architecture considerations
    such as reliability, scalability, and security, and how they apply to AI/ML use
    cases.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is primarily intended for solutions architects, or aspiring solutions
    architects, who wish to learn how to design and implement AI/ML solutions on Google
    Cloud. However, it can also be used by data scientists who wish to learn Google
    Cloud’s AI/ML and generative AI tools and important solution architecture concepts
    that can help them build robust solutions.

- en: In my career, I’ve gained a lot of experience in writing technical documents
    for broad audiences. I’ve learned that a best practice in that regard is to never
    assume that the readers of the documents have prior “intrinsic knowledge” of the
    topic at hand. In this book, you’ll find that I start each chapter with the basics
    that need to be understood before moving on to more complex topics. The benefit
    of this approach is that if you already have knowledge of the basics, you can
    skip straight to the more complex topics, whereas if a topic is new to you, you
    will not be left behind. This means that the book is suitable both for beginners
    and advanced practitioners because each chapter starts with the basic concepts
    and progresses towards covering more advanced use cases.

    concepts and then builds in complexity through examples and hands-on activities
    to eventually dive deep into advanced, cutting-edge AI/ML applications that address
    real-world use cases in today’s market.
