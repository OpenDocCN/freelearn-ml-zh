<p>With the huge amount of data being generated over the internet and the benefits that Machine Learning (ML) predictions bring to businesses, ML implementation has become a low-hanging fruit that everyone is striving for. The complex mathematics behind it, however, can be discouraging for a lot of users. This is where H2O comes in – it automates various repetitive steps, and this encapsulation helps developers focus on results rather than handling complexities.</p>
<p>You’ll begin by understanding how H2O’s AutoML simplifies the implementation of ML by providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to train and use ML models. Next, you’ll see how AutoML automates the entire process of training multiple models, optimizing their hyperparameters, as well as explaining their performance. As you advance, you’ll find out how to leverage a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) and Model Object, Optimized (MOJO) to deploy your models to production. Throughout this book, you’ll take a hands-on approach to implementation using H2O that’ll enable you to set up your ML systems in no time.</p>
<p>By the end of this H2O book, you’ll be able to train and use your ML models using H2O AutoML, right from experimentation all the way to production without a single need to understand complex statistics or data science.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for engineers and data scientists who want to quickly adopt ML into their products without worrying about the internal intricacies of training ML models.</p>
<p>If you are someone who wants to incorporate ML into your software system but doesn’t know where to start or doesn’t have much expertise in the domain of ML, then you will find this book useful. </p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>Basic knowledge of statistics and programming is beneficial. Some understanding of ML and Python will be helpful. You will need Python installed on your computer, preferably with version 3.7 or above, or R installed on your computer with version 4.0 or above. All code examples have been tested using Python 3.10 and R 4.1.2 on Windows 10 OS and Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. However, they should work with future version releases too.</p>
