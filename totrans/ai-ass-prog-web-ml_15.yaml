    previous chapter with the Fashion-MNIST dataset, we now pivot to a more intricate
    and visually complex challenge. This chapter marks our transition from the primarily
    tabular, grayscale world of Fashion-MNIST to the colorful and diverse realm of
    the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here, we elevate our focus to **Convolutional Neural Networks**
    (**CNNs**), a class of deep neural networks that are revolutionizing the way we
    approach image classification tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our journey through the MLP chapter provided a strong foundation for understanding
    the basics of neural networks and their application in classifying simpler, grayscale
    images. Now, we step into a more advanced territory where CNNs reign supreme.
    The CIFAR-10 dataset, with its array of 32x32 color images across 10 different
    classes, presents a unique set of challenges that MLPs are not best suited to
    address. This is where CNNs, with their ability to capture spatial and textural
    patterns in images, come into play.
  prefs: []

    gained, applying them to a more complex dataset that closely mimics real-world
    scenarios. The CIFAR-10 dataset not only tests the limits of image classification
    models but also serves as an excellent platform for us to explore the advanced
    capabilities of CNNs.

    you through the nuances of CNNs. We will delve into why CNNs are the preferred
    choice for image data, how they differ from MLPs in handling color and texture,
    and what makes them so effective in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CNNs are particularly effective for image-related
    problems due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from
    raw pixel data. By training a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we aim to develop
    a robust system capable of accurately classifying objects into one of the ten

- en: Residual blocks are a fundamental component of deep neural networks, particularly
    in architectures like ResNet and its variants. They are designed to address the
    vanishing gradient problem that occurs during the training of very deep networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Residual blocks are composed of two main paths: the identity path and the shortcut
    path. The identity path is the main path through the block, while the shortcut
    path provides a direct connection for the input to skip one or more layers.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here’s a basic overview of how residual blocks work:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Identity Path**: The input to the residual block is passed through a series
    of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions. This sequence
    of operations allows the network to learn a representation of the input data.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Shortcut Path**: The original input to the residual block (identity) is passed
    through a separate path, bypassing some of the convolutional layers. This path
    is known as the “shortcut” or “skip” connection.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Merge Operation**: The outputs from the identity path and the shortcut path
    are combined using element-wise addition. This merge operation adds the original
    input to the output of the convolutional layers.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Activation Function**: Finally, the combined output undergoes an activation
    function, typically a **ReLU** (**Rectified Linear Unit**) activation, to introduce
    non-linearity.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key idea behind residual blocks is that the shortcut connection allows the
    gradient to flow more easily through the network during backpropagation. If the
    identity path (convolutional layers) learns to approximate the identity function,
    the residual block can learn to adjust the output by a small residual mapping,
    hence the name “residual block.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By enabling the direct propagation of the input signal through the shortcut
    connection, residual blocks mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and facilitate
    the training of very deep neural networks. This architecture has been highly successful
    in various tasks, leading to the development of deeper and more accurate models.
