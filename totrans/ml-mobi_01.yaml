    Machine learning is not a new subject. It existed over 10-20 years ago, so why

    data explosion. Social networking and mobile devices have enabled the generation
    of user data like never before. Ten years ago, you didn''t have images uploaded
    to the cloud like you do today because mobile phone penetration then cannot be
    compared to what it is today. The 4G connection makes it possible even to live

- en: To put it in simple terms, if a computer program is able to improve the way
    it performs a task with the help of previous experience, this way you will know
    the computer has learned. This scenario is very different from one where a program
    can perform a particular task because its programmers have already defined all
    the parameters and have provided the data required to do so. A normal program
    can perform the task of playing chess because the programmers have written the
    code to play chess with a built-in winning strategy. However, a machine learning
    program does not possess a built-in strategy; in fact, it only has a set of rules
    of the legal moves in the game, and what a winning scenario is. In such a case,
    the program needs to learn by repeatedly playing the game until it can win.

  zh: 用简单的话来说，如果一个计算机程序能够借助以往的经验改进其完成任务的方式，那么这种方式你就可以知道计算机已经学会了。这种情况与一个程序能够执行特定任务的情况非常不同，因为它的程序员已经定义了所有参数，并提供了执行所需的数据。一个普通的程序可以执行下棋的任务，因为程序员已经编写了带有内置胜利策略的代码来玩棋。然而，机器学习程序没有内置的策略；实际上，它只有一套游戏合法移动的规则，以及什么是胜利场景。在这种情况下，程序需要通过反复玩游戏来学习，直到它能够获胜。

    it learn. The model learns by itself based on the data fed to it and provides
    us with patterns it has learned. It doesn't predict any discrete categorical value
    or a continuous value, but rather provides the patterns it has understood by looking
    at the data fed into it. The training data fed in is unlabeled and doesn't provide
    sufficient knowledge information for the model to learn.

    model and the method adopted by the model to infer patterns in the dataset, there
    emerge two common categories of algorithms. These are clustering and association
    rule mapping algorithms.

- en: Clustering is the model that analyzes the input dataset and groups data items
    with similarity into the same cluster. It produces different clusters and each
    cluster will hold data items that are more similar to each other than in items
    belonging to other clusters. There are various mechanisms that can be used to
    create these clusters.
  id: totrans-156

    of customers and capture all features of customers. The model could come up with
    interesting cluster patterns of customers that may be very obvious to the human
    eye. Such clusters could be very helpful for targeted campaigns and marketing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, association rule learning is a model to discover relations
    between variables in large datasets. A classic example would be market basket
    analysis. Here, the model tries to find strong relationships between different
    items in the market basket. It predicts relationships between items and determines
    how likely or unlikely it is for a user to purchase a particular item when they
    also purchase another item. For example, it might predict that a user who purchases
    bread will also purchase milk, or a user who purchases wine will also purchase
    diapers, and so on.

    in the dataset or labels are present for all the observations. Semi-supervised
    learning falls in between these two. In many practical situations, the cost of
    labeling is quite high, since it requires skilled human experts to do that. So,
    if labels are absent in the majority of the observations, but present in a few,
    then semi-supervised algorithms are the best candidates for the model building.

    learns from the environment in an iterative fashion. In the process, the agent

    is not moved to one side, studies the surface, and also plans actions as per the
    surface, slope, hill, and so on. So, it will learn all possible scenarios and
    states required to learn to ride the bicycle. A fall may be considered as negative
    feedback and the ability to ride along stride may be a positive reward for the
    child. This is classic reinforcement learning. This is the same as what the model
    does to determine the ideal behavior within a specific context, in order to maximize
    its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn its
    behavior; this is known as the **reinforcement signal**:'
