- en: The automation of machine learning tasks allows developers more time to focus
    on the usability and reactivity of the software powered by machine learning models.
    TPOT is a Python automated machine learning tool used for optimizing machine learning
    pipelines using genetic programming. Automating machine learning with TPOT enables
    individuals and companies to develop production-ready machine learning models
    more cheaply and quickly than with traditional methods.

- en: With this practical guide to AutoML, developers working with Python on machine
    learning tasks will be able to put their knowledge to work and become productive
    quickly. You'll adopt a hands-on approach to learning the implementation of AutoML
    and its associated methodologies. Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential
    concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions, this book will show
    you how to build automated classification and regression models and compare their
    performance to custom-built models. As you advance, you'll also develop state-of-the-art
    models using only a couple of lines of code and see how those models outperform
    all of your previous models on the same datasets.

    book was tested on Python 3.8.x, but any version above 3.6 should work fine. The
    book isn't OS-specific, as all of the code will work independently of the OS.
    Still, keep in mind that most of the code was initially run on macOS.
