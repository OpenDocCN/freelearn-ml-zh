- en: This part provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of data privacy
    and the distinction between sensitive data and personal sensitive data, along
    with the importance of data privacy regulations. The concept of privacy by design
    is discussed, emphasizing the proactive integration of privacy measures into systems
    and processes. Additionally, notable privacy breaches in major enterprise companies
    are examined, highlighting the potential consequences and risks associated with
    such incidents. This introduction sets the foundation for understanding the significance
    of data privacy and the need for robust privacy measures. This part also covers
    privacy threat modeling using the LINDDUN framework in detail.

- en: The second chapter in this part focuses on the different phases of the machine
    learning pipeline and the privacy threats and attacks that can occur at each stage.
    We will explore the phases of data collection, data preprocessing, model training,
    and inference. Within each phase, specific privacy threats and attacks, such as
    model inversion attacks and training data extraction attacks, are discussed in
    detail, providing illustrative examples. The importance of protecting training
    data privacy, input data privacy, model privacy, and inference/output data privacy
    is emphasized. This part highlights the potential risks and challenges associated
    with privacy in machine learning, underlining the need for robust privacy preservation
    techniques throughout the entire process. Exploration of privacy threats and attacks
    in each phase of the machine learning pipeline sheds light on the challenges of
    preserving privacy in machine learning systems.
