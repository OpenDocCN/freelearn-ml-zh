			<p>In this final section, we will bring our models into production by deploying them to a cluster for batch scoring or to endpoints for online scoring and we will learn how to monitor these deployments. Furthermore, we will discuss specialized deployment targets and available integrations with other Azure services. Bringing everything we learned together, we will then learn how to operate enterprise-grade end-to-end <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) projects using MLOps concepts and Azure DevOps. Finally, we will end the book with a summary of what we learned, having a look at what can and will change and gaining an understanding of our responsibility when building ML models and working with data.</p>
