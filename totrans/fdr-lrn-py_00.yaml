- en: '**Federated learning** (**FL**) is becoming a paradigm-shifting technology
    in AI because it is often said that with the FL framework, it is the machine learning
    model that needs to move around across the Internet, not the data itself, for
    the intelligence to continuously evolve and grow. Therefore, people call FL a
    model-centric approach, compared to the traditional data-centric approach, thus
    it is considered a game-changing technology. The idea of the model-centric approach
    can create an intelligence-centric platform to pioneer the wisdom-driven world.'

- en: By adopting FL, you can overcome the challenges that big data AI has been facing
    for a long time, such as data privacy, training cost and efficiency, and delay
    in the delivery of the most updated intelligence. However, FL is not a magic solution
    to resolve all the issues in big data just by aggregating machine learning models
    blindly. We need to design the distributed systems and learning mechanisms very
    carefully to synchronize all the distributed learning processes and synthesize
    all the locally trained machine learning models consistently. That way, we can
    create a sustainable and resilient FL system that can continuously function even
    in a real operation at scale.

- en: Therefore, this book goes beyond just describing the conceptual and theoretical
    aspects of FL as seen in many research projects with simulators or prototypes
    that have been introduced in most of the literature related to this field. Rather,
    you will learn about the entire design and implementation principles by looking
    into the codes of the simplified federated learning system to validate the workings
    and results of the framework.

    learning that can be installed and tested in various settings in both local and
    cloud environments.

    Traditional AI*, is all about orienting you to understand the current issues with
    big data systems and the traditional centralized machine learning approach and
    how FL could resolve those problems, such as data privacy, bias and silos, model
    drifts, and performance degradation. This will prepare you to dive deeper into
