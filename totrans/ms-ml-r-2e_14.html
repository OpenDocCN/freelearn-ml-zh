<div class="packt_quote">"If someone asks me what cloud computing is, I try not to get bogged down with definitions. I tell them that, simply put, cloud computing is a better way to run your business."<br/>
                                                                                - Marc Benioff, CEO, Salesforce.com</div>
<p>Since I'm not a CEO of a company trying to profit from the cloud, let's get bogged down with a definition. I like the one put forward by Microsoft<sup>TM</sup> here--<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/</a>.</p>
<div class="packt_quote"><span>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services--servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more--over the Internet ("the cloud"). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how you're billed for water or electricity at home.<br/></span></div>
<p>If you are not using the cloud for machine learning, well I guarantee that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you will. I still know some people who fear the idea of losing control of their data, security issues, and so on. However, as one start-up CEO put it to me, I like to ask them if they access their supposedly secure data on a laptop via WiFi, and when they reply sure, they are telling me they are on the cloud and it is just a matter of where the hardware is stored. </p>
<p>There you have it. Do you want your office dungeon to have rows of servers or do you want to let someone else handle that problem with their secure, redundant, and discrete global infrastructure?</p>
<p>Using cloud-based computing with R can facilitate the seamless work across multiple locations and also provide you with tremendous computing power, which can be quickly scaled up or down as needed. This can be a significant cost saving.</p>
<p>There are many ways to get R on the cloud, but I am going to use <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong>AWS</strong>) and their <strong>Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong>EC2</strong>) for this demonstration because it is what I first learned and it is what I'm familiar using. That is not to say I endorse it over other products. I don't and won't, unless Jeff Bezos selects me for a manned space mission, then my attitude shall change.</p>
<p>At any rate, the goal here is to get you up and running with R and RStudio on the cloud quickly and without having to write a line of Linux code. Now, to maximize the power of AWS and its bewildering array of tools, you can learn how to apply Linux code through a <strong>Secure Shell</strong> (<strong>SSH</strong>). To do this, we will create and launch a virtual computer known as an <strong>instance</strong>. We will then login to RStudio via a web browser and cover some of the functionality. There are many tutorials out on the web about how to do this, but my goal is to get you started in the simplest and quickest manner possible, and to get you using R on the cloud <strong>TODAY</strong>.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Creating an Amazon Web Services account</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>The first thing to do is to sign up for an AWS account:</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a></p>
<p>This is the only prerequisite for this exercise. The process requires a credit card, but what we will be doing here will not cost a cent as it is done on a free instance. Going forward, you can quickly launch a new instance with greater computing power as needed, then stop or terminate the instance when finished. As you create your account and login, you can choose to create security groups or not. I will demonstrate it by creating a new security group during instance creation. A security group allows you to control who can and how they can access the instance. Also, don't worry about creating a <strong>Pair Key</strong> at this point unless you so desire. We will create that as well.</p>
<p>Once that is completed, log in to your AWS console, which should give you a webpage looking like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="279" width="471" class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_01.png"/></div>
<p>If you are here, it is now time to create and launch a virtual machine with a simple click on the cleverly named hyperlink <span class="packt_screen">Launch a virtual machine</span>.</p>

            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>The hyperlink to launch a virtual machine will take you to this page:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="268" width="529" class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_02.png"/></div>
<p>Avoid the <span class="packt_screen">Get Started</span> button and click on <span class="packt_screen">advanced EC2 Launch Instance Wizard</span>, which takes you to this page:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="258" width="637" class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_03.png"/></div>
<p>As you gain experience, you can use the various <strong>Amazon Machine Images</strong> (<strong>AMI</strong>) and customize how you use R on AWS. However, our goals here are quick and simple. With that in mind, there are several community AMIs created by AWS users that incorporate R and RStudio already. So, under <span class="packt_screen">Quick Start</span>, click <span class="packt_screen">Community AMIs</span>. A search box will pop up and I recommend to start using the AMI maintained by Louis Aslett, <a href="http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/">http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/</a>. This AMI will be displayed by searching for <span class="packt_screen">rstudio aslett</span>.  That will bring the page up, so click on the <span class="packt_screen">Select</span> button, as shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="106" width="670" class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_04.png"/></div>
<p>This takes you to <span class="packt_screen">Step 2</span>, where you select the instance type. I've picked the <kbd>t2.micro</kbd> free tier:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_05.png"/></div>
<p>Once you've picked the instance type you desire, hit <span class="packt_screen">Review and Launch</span>. Since this is an existing AMI, you can jump to <span class="packt_screen">Step 7</span>, the <span class="packt_screen">Review tab</span>. You can launch from here, but let's click on <span class="packt_screen">Step 6</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Configure Security Group:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_06.png"/></div>
<p>This will bring you to the step in the process where you can either create a security group or use an existing one. Here is an example of creating a <span class="packt_screen">new security group</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_07.png"/></div>
<p>Once you are satisfied with that step in the process (you don't have to change a thing), click <span class="packt_screen">Review and Launch</span>. That takes you back to <span class="packt_screen">Step 7</span>, where you can simply click on <span class="packt_screen">Launch</span>. This brings you to the point where you select a new or existing key pair:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="336" width="474" class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_08.png"/></div>
<p>Once completed, click <span class="packt_screen">Launch Instances</span> and proceed back to your AWS console.</p>

            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>With your instance running, when you return to the AWS console and select that instance you will see something like the following:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_09.png"/></div>
<p>Take note of the <span class="packt_screen">Public DNS</span> on the selected instance. This will be all that you need to start RStudio on your web browser of choice. When you launch that in your browser, you will come to the RStudio login page. The username and password are both <kbd>rstudio</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="233" width="498" class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_10.png"/></div>
<p>That's it! You are now running RStudio on a virtual machine. It should look like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/image_14_11.png"/></div>
<p>In the upper-left panel, the <span class="packt_screen">Source Panel</span>, are instructions on how to change the password as well as functions to link to Dropbox. </p>
<p>To show how to load data from the web, I will load one of the <kbd>.csv</kbd> files from github that we've used in prior chapters. Let's try <kbd>climate.csv</kbd> shall we? The first thing is to install and load the <kbd>RCurl</kbd> package:</p>
<pre>
<strong><span class="GEM3DMTCLGB ace_keyword">   &gt; </span><span class="GEM3DMTCLFB ace_keyword">install.packages("RCurl")<br/><br/>   &gt; library(RCurl)<br/></span></strong>
</pre>
<p>We now need to get the link to the data on github:</p>
<pre>
<strong><span class="GEM3DMTCLGB ace_keyword"> &gt; </span><span class="GEM3DMTCLFB ace_keyword">url &lt;-  <br/>     "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datameister66/data/master/climate.csv"</span></strong>
</pre>
<p>Then, pull the file into RStudio:</p>
<pre>
<strong><span class="GEM3DMTCLGB ace_keyword">    &gt; </span></strong><span class="GEM3DMTCLFB ace_keyword"><strong>climate &lt;-read.csv(text = getURL(url))</strong><br/></span>
</pre>
<p>And, be sure it worked:</p>
<pre>
<strong><span class="GEM3DMTCLGB ace_keyword">    &gt; </span><span class="GEM3DMTCLFB ace_keyword">head(climate)<br/></span>      Year CO2   Temp<br/>    1 1919 806 -0.272<br/>    2 1920 932 -0.241<br/>    3 1921 803 -0.187<br/>    4 1922 845 -0.301<br/>    5 1923 970 -0.272<br/>    6 1924 963 -0.292</strong>
</pre>
<p>There you have it. You are now a cloud-based machine learning warrior, able to operate on the virtual machine almost exactly like you would on your own machine.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Please remember that once you are done and quit RStudio, be sure to go back to your console and stop the instance.</div>

<p>In this final chapter, we went through the process of quickly and simply getting R and RStudio running on the cloud. Utilizing AWS in this exercise, we covered step by step how to create a virtual machine (an instance) on the cloud, configure it, launch it and bring up RStudio on a web browser. Finally, we went over how easy it is to load data, by bringing in the climate <kbd>.csv</kbd> file from GitHub. With this introduction to cloud computing, you can now perform work anywhere you have an Internet connection, and can quickly scale the power of your instance to meet your needs. That concludes the primary chapters of the book. I hope you've enjoyed it and can implement the methods in here as well as other methods you learn over time. Thank You!</p>
