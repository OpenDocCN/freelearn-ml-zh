<p>This section focuses on advanced machine learning concepts and how they can be implemented using OpenCV and scikit-learn. We will cover some advanced machine learning concepts, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and Bayesian learning, and then finally move on to discuss the second type of machine learning problems—unsupervised learning.</p>
