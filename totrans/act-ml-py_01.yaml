- en: In the rapidly evolving landscape of **machine learning** (**ML**), the concept
    of active ML has emerged as a transformative approach that optimizes the learning
    process by selectively querying the most informative data points from unlabeled
    datasets. This part of the book is dedicated to laying the foundational principles,
    strategies such as uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee, expected model change,
    expected error reduction, and density-weighted methods, and considerations essential
    for understanding and implementing active ML effectively. Through a structured
    exploration, we aim to equip readers with a solid grounding of the best practices
    for managing the human in the loop by exploring labeling interface design, effective
    workflows, strategies for handling model-label disagreements, finding adequate
    labelers, and managing them efficiently.
