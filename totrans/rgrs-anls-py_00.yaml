- en: Linear models have been known to scholars and practitioners and studied by them
    for a long time now. Before they were adopted into data science and placed into
    the syllabi of numerous boot camps and in the early chapters of many practical
    how-to-do books, they have been a prominent and relevant element of the body of
    knowledge of statistics, economics, and of many other respectable quantitative
    fields of study.

- en: Consequently, there is a vast availability of monographs, book chapters, and
    papers about linear regression, logistic regression (its classification variant),
    and the different types of generalized linear models; models where the original
    linear regression paradigm is adapted in its formulation in order to solve more
    complex problems.

    any book that really explains the speed and ease of implementation of such linear
    models when, as a developer or a data scientist, you have to quickly create an
    application or API whose response cannot be defined programmatically but it does
    have to learn from data.

    solution for any data science problem; however, our experience in the field has
    told us that the following advantages of a linear model cannot be easily ignored:'

    "Chapter 1. Regression – The Workhorse of Data Science"), *Regression – The Workhorse
    of Data Science,* introduces why regression is indeed useful for data science,
    how to quickly set up Python for data science and provides an overview of the
    packages used throughout the book with the help of examples. At the end of this
    chapter, we will be able to run all the examples contained in the following chapters.
    You will have clear ideas and motivations why regression analysis is not just
    an underrated technique taken from statistics but a powerful and effective data
    science algorithm.'

    "Chapter 2. Approaching Simple Linear Regression"), *Approaching Simple Linear
    Regression,* presents the simple linear regression by first describing a regression
    problem, where to fit a regressor, and then giving some intuitions underneath
    the math formulation of its algorithm. Then, you will learn how to tune the model
    for higher performances and understand every parameter of it, deeply. Finally,
    the engine under the hood the gradient descent will be described.'

    extends the simple linear regression to extract predictive information from more
    than a feature and create models that can solve real-life prediction tasks. The
    stochastic gradient descent technique, explained in the previous chapter, will
    be powered up to cope with a matrix of features and to complete the overview,
    you will be shown multi-collinearity, interactions, and polynomial regression
    topics.'

    the foundations of your knowledge of linear model. Starting from the necessary

- en: First, this book is addressed to Python developers with at least a basic understanding
    of data science, statistics, and math. Though the book doesn't require a previous
    background in data science or statistics, it can well address data scientists
    of any seniority who intend to learn how to best do regression analysis on a dataset.
    We imagine that you want to put intelligence in your data products but you don't
    want to depend on any black box. Therefore, you prefer a technique which is simple,
    understandable, and yet effective to be production grade. Through the book, we
    will provide you with the knowledge to use Python for building fast and better
    linear models and to deploy the resulting models in Python or in any computer
    language you prefer.
