    who sells different used cars and wants to set the most relevant prices. The car
    dealer should determine the prices based on the car model, age, and other features.

    the revenue. Similar to the fruit monger, if the price of a car is too high, the
    car dealer won't sell it in a short time, so there will be an extra storage cost
    and the car will lose value. This leads to an extra cost and a decrease in the
    profit, thereby damaging the business. On the other hand, if the price is too
    low, the company will sell the car immediately. Although the storage cost is lower,
    the company hasn't made the best profit. In order to sell cars and maximize profit,
    the company wants to figure out the optimal prices.

    websites is time-consuming, especially if there are many categories of cars, so
    it is hard or even impossible to check the prices on a daily basis. Another issue
    is that there might be many websites, making it impossible for a single person

    sources. The company sales data shows how the customers reacted to their prices
    in the past. For instance, we know how long it took to sell each car in the past.

- en: In our problem, the target of machine learning algorithms is to forecast the
    sales volume of an item depending on its price. The branch of techniques that
    learn from the data to forecast a future event is called **supervised learning**.
    The starting point of the algorithms is a training set of data that consists of
    objects whose event is already known. The algorithms identify a relationship between
    the data that describes the object and the event. Then, they build a model that
    defines this relationship and use the model for forecasting the event on other
    objects. The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised
    learning techniques use training with known events whereas unsupervised learning
    techniques identify patterns that were hidden.

- en: An easy way is to measure the distance as the sum of dissimilarities between
    the features. For instance, a very simple dissimilarity can be the price difference
    plus the number of categorical features that display different values. A slightly
    more advantageous way is to give a different weight to each feature on the basis
    of its relevancy. For instance, two items that do not belong to the same department
    are very dissimilar, whereas two items that are of the same product but of different
    brands are very similar.

- en: After defining the distance function, we want to identify the *k* most similar
    objects depending on the price. For each price point, we define an item with the
    features of the new item and the chosen price. Then, for each item in the supermarket,
    we compute the distance between the item and the new item. In this way, we can
    pick the *k* items whose distance is the lowest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After having identified the *k* most similar items, we need to determine how
    to use this information in order to estimate the new volume. A simple method is
    to compute the average between the sales volumes of the *k* items. A more advanced
    approach is to give more importance to more similar items.

    unsupervised and supervised learning. Unsupervised learning techniques identify
