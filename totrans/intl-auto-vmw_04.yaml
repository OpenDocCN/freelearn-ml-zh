    ONE platform with data-based actions and resolution from a single repository.
    Users want to access their corporate data and applications from anywhere on any
    device. Security tools are not able to take care of end user requirements and
    security risks in a proactive way in the current environment. Customers can't
    get complete insight into device, application, and user data due to the always-changing
    perimeter ( Location of End User's Device ) which creates big cybersecurity threats
    and complicates the management task.

    security. Employee productivity is affected by application execution issues and
    irregular services. It will be affected by frequent changes in application access
    by reducing privileges. We have to find a way around security and user's productivity
    and avoid a complicated management process by using intelligent data analysis
    and automation. We also need a solution for frequently-changing threat areas,
    which can integrate with all relevant services and provide assurance on security
    aspects in the current digital workspace system.

    which helps customers with great graphics, user interface tools, and an intelligent
    process, to take data-driven decisions from a single source of truth. Workspace
    ONE Intelligence helps to filter and find **key performance indicators** (**KPIs**)
    on demand by collecting, examining, and connecting device, application, and user
    data. As it gets the required data information, it then can leverage the built-in
    rule engine to automate policies that can make moves based on broad metrics. Customers
    can define rules that can make intelligent remediation moves as per context. AI
    and ML techniques can be utilized for suggested actions and future-planning for
    an entire digital workspace system that customers can manage without compromising
    the end user's productivity.
