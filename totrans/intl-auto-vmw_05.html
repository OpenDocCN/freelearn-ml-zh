<p>In this chapter, we will focus on how VMware helps customers to automate data centers and the public cloud running on vSphere by injecting advanced analytics into the solution to manage IT operations based on intent. The capacity analytics engine with vRealize Operations leverages ML techniques to proactively alert you about future events based on past trend analysis.</p>
<p>We will learn about different analytics engines in vRealize Suite and how vRealize tools work across different clouds. Also, we will learn about the automation of containers on vSphere by reducing the <span><strong>total cost of ownership</strong> (</span><strong>TCO</strong>) and improve ROI with better optimizations.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unified end-to-end monitoring</li>
<li>Intelligent operational analytics with the <span><strong>Software-Defined Data Center</strong> (</span><strong>SDDC</strong>) journey</li>
<li>The vRealize operations architecture and capacity planning</li>
<li>VMware container management services</li>
<li>VMware Cloud on the AWS implementation plan</li>
</ul>

<p>Monitoring solutions should collect and monitor end-to-end service-level and infrastructure-level KPIs, such as response times by transaction and service availability, and alert on deviations. It can understand and map all of the components of the end-to-end service, such as applications and application components, and monitor the performance and availability of all of the application platform components, such as the web server, application server, message bus, and database. We should understand and map all of the virtual and physical infrastructure components, including VMs, server, storage, and network, by monitoring the performance and availability of all of the virtual and physical infrastructure components. We can combine and correlate all these parameters to generate alerts by identifying the root cause of alerts. IT Operation team can get all of the information on a customizable dashboard as per their roles with all reporting capabilities. It should add a predictive element to the analysis capability in order to prevent business outages.</p>

<p>The highly dynamic and complex nature of virtual environments requires a holistic perspective and making essential correlations with the applications and other parts of the infrastructure. It requires a new class of data management and analysis technique(tools designed for physical infrastructure do not work well with the dynamic and decentralized nature of virtual environments).</p>
<p>Operational analytics consists of two key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance analytics help customers to adopt a proactive approach in IT operations for faster issue-detection and resolution by enabling the following:
<ul>
<li>Proactive control of service performance and availability based on automatic learning, near-real-time adjustment of baselines, statistical and trending algorithms</li>
<li>Service impact analysis and prioritization</li>
<li>Problem isolation and root-cause analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Capacity analytics enable a predictive approach through current and historical data analysis, simulation, and what-if scenario-enabling:
<ul>
<li>Capacity planning and forecasting for medium to long-term provisioning</li>
<li>Predictive alerts</li>
<li>Near-real-time capacity optimization through automated provisioning and scaling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">vRealize Operations Manager collects and analyzes information from multiple data sources within the enterprise. vRealize Operations Manager uses advanced analytics algorithms to learn and recognize the normal behavior of every object it monitors. This information is presented to users through views, reports, and dashboards.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The user interface allows users to access the results of the analytics in the form of badges, alerts, charts, and reports.</p>
<p>vRealize Operations Manager can be download as a <strong>virtual appliance</strong> (<strong>vApp</strong>) and run as a VM. It will be configured to perform one of the following roles within the complete vRealize Operations Manager cluster design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master node</strong>: The critical first node in the cluster or it will be a single standalone node in a small deployment architecture</li>
<li><strong>Master replica node</strong>: An optional instance for high availability</li>
<li><strong>Data node</strong>: Used for scalability purposes</li>
<li><strong>Remote collector node</strong><span>: Helps to overcome data-collection issues, such as poor network performance across the network</span></li>
</ul>
<p>vRealize Operations Manager is available in two different deployment models:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pre-configured vApp </li>
<li>As a Windows or Linux installable package</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer can choose the vApp model for ease of deployment.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP Service</strong> is the main product UI. It supports the main product UI, administrator UI, and suite API. This explains how vRealize Operations Manager calculates stress, and then how stress is used for capacity-planning calculations of recommended size, capacity remaining, and time remaining. This provides enough detail that people can understand how vROps calculates these values, can defend when they are reasonable, can recognize when a fluke in data is causing recommendations that should be overruled and explains the concepts behind parameters that can be tuned in vROps.</p>

<p>Stress is a measure of the severity of performance problems because of being undersized in the worst hour of the past month. It is an intelligent way of dealing with peaks and fluctuations in demand, which considers both how hot the resource ran and for how long in a continuous period.</p>
<p><strong>Total capacity versus usable capacity</strong>: Total capacity is the raw capacity. Usable is the capacity we pretend we have for planning purposes, allowing for host failures and subtracting some headroom to be safe.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><em>Total capacity – Buffers (HA and general) = Usable Capacity</em>. You can see this in <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Capacity Remaining</span> in the vROps UI.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The capacity defines the stress zone. For stress calculations, do we use total or usable as the capacity? It depends on whether we want to know what actually happened (total), or whether we're planning for the future and want to be more cautious (usable).</p>
<p class="mce-root">For actual stress calculations, we use total capacity as the capacity. When planning and finding suggested right-sizes, we want to be cautious, so we do stress calculations where the capacity is the usable capacity and given the measured demand, at what capacity would we barely have avoided performance problems, without wasting resources, after allowing for possible host failure and some headroom to be safe.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is the accepted container orchestrator being adopted by enterprises, but operationalizing Kubernetes in production is not an easy task. Enterprises need a comprehensive solution that supports multi-cloud environments with networking services, security, policies, persistence, monitoring, and analytics. As more containers are being used, customers need orchestration tools to manage operations, such as scaling up and down, scheduling containers, and handling failure, <span>in order to run and manage these containers</span>. Container-orchestration tools, such as Docker Swarm and Mesosphere, are available but the most accepted is an open source system called Kubernetes. Kubernetes has a perfect solution for running containerized apps but operating Kubernetes in a production environment is still a complex task. Production capabilities (such as storage, networking, security, multi-tenancy, and persistence) need more enhancement and complementary tools to reliably deploy, maintain, scale, monitor, and self-heal the underlying infrastructure.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>VMware has </span><strong>Pivotal Container Service</strong> (<strong>PKS</strong>),<span> a joint product developed by VMware, Pivotal, and Google that deploys and manages enterprise-grade Kubernetes on top of the VMware SDDC stack as well as on public cloud providers such as <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong>GCP</strong>). </span>VMware PKS helps enterprises to run Kubernetes in production on vSphere and in the public cloud. It radically simplifies the deployment and operation of Kubernetes so you can run containers easily at scale. We can help customers with PKS so they can quickly set up and manage a Kubernetes service within their existing vSphere environment. Customers are looking for a Kubernetes solution that is simple to deploy and operate by helping them to take care of all of the day-one and day-two needs and eliminate the lengthy steps of setting up and maintaining the platforms. They are also demanding that the solution offer hardened production capabilities in the areas of networking, storage, security, and multi-tenancy. </p>
<p><strong>VMware Kubernetes Engine</strong> (<strong>VKE</strong>) is an enterprise-grade <strong>Kubernetes as a Service</strong> (<strong>KaaS</strong>) offering that provides easy-to-use, secure-by-default, and cost-effective Kubernetes. VKE will launch first on AWS. </p>
<p>Forrester had a 31-criteria evaluation of hybrid cloud-monitoring and -management providers; here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have core capabilities in multi-cloud management across workloads</li>
<li>Must support at least the AWS, Azure, and vSphere-based clouds</li>
<li>Must be sold as a standalone tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Containers are productive as a container offers developers a simple, lightweight, and portable way to package and deploy applications across various hosts or cloud environments. The use of containers is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years because of these benefits. Containers are not a new technology, but a company called Docker successfully popularized this technology and Docker is the most-known container format today.</p>

<p>VMware defines the following journey stages toward SDDC:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost center</strong>: IT operates as a cost center. The focus is on reducing costs through CapEx and OpEx savings by improving IT efficiency with uniform  anarchitecture and by virtualizing the infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Service provider</strong>: IT becomes a service provider by delivering secure, highly-available, and resilient IT services that meet business demands and service-level requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Business partner</strong>: IT transforms to become a business partner by automating the delivery of infrastructure and application, resulting in faster delivery times and more responsive IT, enabling a quicker time to market.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three stages of capability maturity for this data center virtualization and standardization: </p>
<ul>
<li>Compute virtualization, virtualization for business critical apps, big-data application support</li>
<li>Software-defined storage, network virtualization, extension to hybrid cloud, data center migration</li>
<li>Management across hybrid, heterogeneous data centers</li>
</ul>
<p>The following capabilities are crucial:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial model and measurement</strong>: Awareness and understanding of the costs of assets and underlying infrastructure capacity</li>
<li><strong>Process and control</strong>: IT processes are adapted for virtualization but are largely manual, with ad hoc inter-process integration</li>
<li>Establishment of standard operating procedures for consistency in operations</li>
<li>Focus on limited, continuous improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>VMware Cloud on AWS <span>is a vSphere-based cloud service. The service brings VMware enterprise class SDDC software to the AWS cloud. It is delivered, sold, and supported by VMware as an on-demand, elastically-scalable service that leverages the global footprint and breadth of services from AWS.</span></p>
<p>Along with VMware vCenter Server® management and optimizations, it presents a full cloud solution that runs on next-generation, elastic, bare-metal, AWS infrastructure.</p>
<p>This will help in the quick deployment of secure, enterprise-grade AWS cloud-based resources that are operationally consistent with vSphere-based clouds. This will result in a complete turnkey service that operates seamlessly with both on-premises private clouds and advanced AWS services.</p>
<p>In addition, new features enable new functionality that revolutionizes business functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VMware Cloud on AWS disaster recovery</strong>: This is an add-on on-demand service that will help to reduce cost, simplify disaster recovery strategy, and accelerate time to production for an environment.</li>
<li><strong>VMware</strong> <strong>Hybrid Cloud Extension</strong> (<strong>HCX</strong>): This helps to accelerate cloud adoption by making bulk migrations available for zero downtime live migrations that can be scheduled. This solution is multisite-aware, WAN-optimized, and secure to allow for migrations to occur as quickly as possible to VMware Cloud on AWS.</li>
</ul>

<p>VMware Cloud on AWS has vSphere running on Amazon's bare-metal hardware with its cloud-automation engine. VMware administrators have access to all of the required interfaces, including VMware vSphere Web Client, both HTML5 and Flash-based, with all of the needed API integrations. This is a VMware-managed service and <strong>role-based access control</strong> (<strong>RBAC</strong>) will be properly working. </p>
<p>Following is the configuration with specific users profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>VMware manages the VMware Cloud on AWS environments and as such, rights are assigned to <kbd>cloudadmin@vsphere.local</kbd> for user access. This might cause incompatibilities with products that require <kbd>administrator@vsphere.local</kbd> access to an environment.</li>
<li>Users are expected to place workloads in the <kbd>Workloads</kbd> folder because permissions are denied on the other folders.</li>
<li><span><span> </span></span>Networking is configured through the VMware Cloud on the AWS user interface as the NSX user interface is not available.</li>
<li>VMware Cloud on AWS is a managed environment, so all upgrades and maintenance procedures are performed by VMware.</li>
</ul>

<p>VMware Cloud on AWS has the benefit of being an architected solution that can be deployed on-demand. It is quite difficult to make sure that requirements are met successfully to connect a pre-existing on-premises environment to the VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>
<p>The current on-premises installation, software revisions, and configuration determine the steps required to successfully connect a VMware Cloud on the AWS instance. This section discusses the implementation path that VMware recommends.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the steps required when assessing an environment for compatibility to connect to a VMware Cloud on AWS environment. The following is a flow chart based on a standard process starting with authentication:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The detailed initial steps to configure VMC on AWS are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to VMware Cloud on AWS</li>
<li>Invite users to join the cloud instance</li>
<li>Link credentials to an Amazon account</li>
<li>Create the VMware Cloud on the AWS SDDC data center<br/>
This step includes the creation of the data center in the <span>VMware Cloud on the AWS instance. During this process, customer will be asked to provide the details for the configuration, including a name, sizing, data center location, and most importantly, the IP address subnet information. The IP address details cannot be changed without deploying the SDDC again, so be sure to specify the correct address.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>On-premises vSphere environmental upgrade:<br/>
The environmental upgrade of vSphere must occur at this point so that there is feature compatibility with the VMware Cloud on the AWS instance. This process can be time-consuming, but verify that all features are compatible. The environment must be at the vSphere 6.0 update 3 or later to be supported, but preferably at vSphere 6.5 to utilize the hybrid linked mode and other functionality.</li>
