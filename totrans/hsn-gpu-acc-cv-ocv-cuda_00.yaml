- en: Computer vision is revolutionizing a wide range of industries and OpenCV is
    the most widely chosen tool for computer vision with the ability to work in multiple
    programming languages. Nowadays, there is a need to process large images in real
    time in computer vision which is difficult to handle for OpenCV on its own. In
    this Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and CUDA can help. So this book provides a
    detailed overview on integrating OpenCV with CUDA for practical applications.
    It starts with explaining the programming of GPU with CUDA which is essential
    for computer vision developers who have never worked with GPU. Then it explains
    OpenCV acceleration with GPU and CUDA by taking some practical examples. When
    computer vision applications are to be used in real life scenarios then it needs
    to deployed on embedded development boards. This book covers the deployment of
    OpenCV applications on NVIDIA Jetson Tx1 which is very popular for computer vision
    and deep learning applications. The last part of the book covers the concept of
    PyCUDA which can be used by Computer vision developers who are using OpenCV with
    Python. PyCUDA is a python library which leverages the power of CUDA and GPU for
    accelerations. This book provides a complete guide for developers using OpenCV
    in C++ or Python in accelerating their computer vision applications by taking
    a hands on approach.

- en: This book is a go-to guide for developers working with OpenCV who now want to
    learn how to process more complex image data by taking advantage of GPU processing.
    Most computer vision engineers or developers face problems when they try to process
    complex image data in real time. That is where the acceleration of computer vision
    algorithms using GPUs will help them in developing algorithms that can work on
    complex image data in real time. Most people think that hardware acceleration
    can only be done using FPGA and ASIC design, and for that, they need knowledge
    of hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL. However, that was only
    true before the invention of CUDA, which leverages the power of Nvidia GPUs and
    can be used to accelerate algorithms by using programming languages such as C++
    and Python with CUDA. This book will help those developers in learning about these
    concepts by helping them to develop practical applications. This book will help
    developers to deploy computer vision applications on embedded platforms such as
    Nvidia Jetson TX1.
