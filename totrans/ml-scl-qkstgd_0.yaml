- en: Machine learning has made a huge impact not only in academia, but also in industry,
    by turning data into actionable intelligence. Scala is not only an object-oriented
    and functional programming language, but can also leverage the advantages of **Java
    Virtual Machine** (**JVM**). Scala provides code complexity optimization and offers
    concise notation, which is probably the reason it has seen a steady rise in adoption
    over the last few years, especially in data science and analytics.

- en: This book is aimed at aspiring data scientists, data engineers, and deep learning
    enthusiasts who are newbies and want to have a great head start at machine learning
    best practices. Even if you're not well versed in machine learning concepts, but
    still want to expand your knowledge by delving into practical implementations
    of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems with Scala,
    you will be able to grasp the content easily!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the chapters, you'll become acquainted with popular machine learning
    libraries in Scala, learning how to carry out regression and classification analysis
    using both linear methods and tree-based ensemble techniques, as well as looking
    at clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction, and recommender systems, before
    delving into deep learning at the end.

    machine learning tasks. This book isn't meant to be read cover to cover. You can
    turn the pages to a chapter that looks like something you're trying to accomplish
    or that ignites your interest.

- en: '[Chapter 1](33fe7442-ce44-4a18-bac6-0e08e9b1ae1e.xhtml), *Introduction to Machine
    Learning with Scala*, first explains some basic concepts of machine learning and
    different learning tasks. It then discusses Scala-based machine learning libraries,
    which is followed by configuring your programming environment. Finally, it covers
    Apache Spark briefly, before demonstrating a step-by-step example.'

    Analysis*, covers a supervised learning task called regression analysis with examples,
    followed by regression metrics. It then explains some regression analysis algorithms,
    including linear regression and generalized linear regression. Finally, it demonstrates
    a step-by-step solution to a regression analysis task using Spark ML in Scala.'

    Classification*, briefly explains another supervised learning task called classification
    with examples, followed by explaining how to interpret performance evaluation
    metrics. It then covers widely used classification algorithms such as logistic
    regression, Naïve Bayes, and **support vector machines** (**SVMs**). Finally,
    it demonstrates a step-by-step solution to a classification problem using Spark
    ML in Scala.'

    including decision trees, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest algorithms,
    for both classification and regression analysis. It then revisits the examples
    of [Chapter 2](f649db9f-aea9-4509-b9b8-e0b7d5fb726a.xhtml), *Scala for Regression
    Analysis*, and [Chapter 3](51712107-c5bc-4d7d-a84a-3039aafc8c0a.xhtml), *Scala

    discusses the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional data, before showing
    an example of solving it using **principal component analysis** (**PCA**).'

    complete installation on VMware Workstation Player 12 or VirtualBox. You can run
    Spark jobs on Windows (7/8/10) or macOS X (10.4.7+) as well.

    Spark jobs, you'll need at least 50 GB of free disk storage for standalone cluster
    and for the SQL warehouse), and at least 16 GB RAM are recommended. And optionally,
    if you want to perform the neural network training on the GPU (for the last chapter
    only), the NVIDIA GPU driver has to be installed with CUDA and CuDNN configured.
