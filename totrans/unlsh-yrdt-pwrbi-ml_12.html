			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Use Cases for OpenAI</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you scored fresh data via the Power BI ML models and assessed the output in comparison to the automated testing performed by Power BI during the training phase. The FAA Wildlife Strike database provided fresh data that was generated in the real world beyond the scope of the training and testing datasets. This data could potentially serve as a framework for scheduling the scoring of new data utilizing a Power BI ML model in collaboration with dataflows. The recently evaluated data produced outcomes that were relatively consistent with the expected results derived from the <span class="No-Break">testing data.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you are tasked by your stakeholders to incorporate OpenAI functionalities into the solution. OpenAI is garnering a lot of attention in the IT sector, and this project is being implemented during this trend. Although this entails a change in scope, the project’s beneficiaries are fully supportive of and optimistic about this initiative. In this chapter, you will examine several use cases for OpenAI with your project, followed by a review of the prerequisites necessary <span class="No-Break">to commence.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Technical requirements</h1>

			<p>In the latter part of 2022, the global media and information technology enthusiasts were captivated by the potential of <strong class="bold">ChatGPT</strong>. ChatGPT is a vast <strong class="bold">large language model</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLM</strong>) chatbot that facilitates <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>natural language communication, code generation, and <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>other functionalities, and was developed <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/><span class="No-Break">by OpenAI.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">OpenAI</p>
			<p class="callout">OpenAI is an AI research <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>organization, and interested readers may find more information <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>about it at this <span class="No-Break">link: </span><a href="https://openai.com/about"><span class="No-Break">https://openai.com/about</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The renowned ChatGPT is constructed utilizing <strong class="bold">generative pre-training</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPT</strong>) models, and OpenAI <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>also produces other types of AI models such as <strong class="bold">DALL-E</strong> for image <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>generation. This book abstains from delving into OpenAI’s intricate details, as there is already a plethora of information available on <span class="No-Break">the internet.</span></p>
			<p>The OpenAI platform is constructed upon Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure, which provides a powerful and reliable foundation for the platform’s diverse range of services. In order to leverage the robust security, governance, and enterprise integration capabilities of the <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>Azure platform, Microsoft offers Azure OpenAI to seamlessly access the models and features of OpenAI, while simultaneously benefiting from the capabilities of the <span class="No-Break">Azure platform.</span></p>

			<p>These next two chapters will home in on the analysis of FAA Wildlife Strike data using OpenAI technology. Building on the previous chapters, we will explore a range of simple use cases for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, both of which are rapidly evolving within the information technology industry. Specifically, we will concentrate on basic summarization and description techniques utilizing GPT models. While code snippets for both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI will be provided, the accompanying screenshots will exclusively feature <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>traditional OpenAI examples, as Azure OpenAI is currently unavailable for use in <span class="No-Break">this publication.</span></p>
			<p>As an active participant in the technical field, it is important to constantly evaluate and improve written content. In this chapter, readers may have already noticed a change in the writing style that can <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>be attributed to the use of OpenAI ChatGPT. While the author remains the same, the assistance of ChatGPT has significantly enhanced the clarity and readability of the text. In fact, the very paragraph that you are currently reading has been optimized using ChatGPT based on the modifications shown in the accompanying screenshot. As we continue to incorporate advanced technology into our writing processes, it is essential to understand its potential benefits and limitations in order to fully leverage <span class="No-Break">its capabilities.</span></p>

			<p>Let’s embark on a <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>journey with OpenAI as we explore techniques for analyzing FAA Wildlife Strike data within Power <span class="No-Break">BI solutions!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Generating descriptions with OpenAI</h1>
			<p>Our first step will be to identify a suitable use case for leveraging the power of GPT models to generate <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>descriptions of elements of FAA Wildlife Strike data. Our objective is to unlock the potential of external data by creating prompts for GPT models that can provide detailed information and insights about the data we are working with. Through this use case, we will explore the value that GPT models can bring to the table when it comes to data analysis <span class="No-Break">and interpretation.</span></p>
			<p>For example, a description of the FAA Wildlife Strike database by ChatGPT might look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer197" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_12.02_B19500.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2 – OpenAI ChatGPT description of FAA Wildlife Strike database"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – OpenAI ChatGPT description of FAA Wildlife Strike database</p>
			<p>Within your solution using the FAA Wildlife Strike database, you have data that could be tied to external <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>data using the GPT models. A few examples include additional information about <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Airports</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">FAA regions</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Flight operators</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Aircraft</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Aircraft engines</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Animal species</span></li>
				<li>Time <span class="No-Break">of year</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When the scoring process for a large number of separate rows in a dataset is automated, we can use a GPT model to generate descriptive text for each individual row. It is worth noting that ChatGPT’s approach varies from this, as it operates as a chatbot that calls upon different GPT models and integrates past conversations into future answers. Despite the differences in how GPT models will be used in the solution, ChatGPT can still serve as a valuable tool for testing various <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
			<p>When using GPT models, the natural language prompts that are used to ask questions and give instructions <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>will impact the context of the generated text. Prompt engineering is a topic that has surged in popularity for OpenAI and LLMs. The following prompts will provide different answers when using “dogs” as a topic for a <span class="No-Break">GPT query:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Tell me </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">about dogs</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">From the perspective of an evolutionary biologist, tell me </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">about dogs</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Tell me the history </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">of dogs</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">At a third-grade level, tell me </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">about dogs</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When planning for your use of OpenAI on large volumes of data, you should test and evaluate your prompt engineering strategy. For this book, the use cases will be kept simple as the goal is to teach tool integration with Power BI. Prompt engineering expertise will probably be the topic of many books and blogs <span class="No-Break">this year.</span></p>
			<p>You can test different requests for a description of an FAA region in <span class="No-Break">the data:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer198" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_12.03_B19500.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3 – Testing the utility of describing an FAA region using OpenAI ChatGPT"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.3 – Testing the utility of describing an FAA region using OpenAI ChatGPT</p>
			<p>You can also combine <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>different data elements for a more detailed description. The following example combines data fields with a question to ask (<strong class="source-inline">Tell me about the Species in State </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">in Month</strong></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer199" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_12.04_B19500.jpg" alt="Figure 12.4 – Using ChatGPT to test a combination of data about species, state, and month"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.4 – Using ChatGPT to test a combination of data about species, state, and month</p>
			<p>There are many different options to consider. In order to both combine a few fields of data, and provide <a id="_idIndexMarker655"/>useful context about the data, you decide to plan a use case for describing the aircraft and operator. An example can be tested in OpenAI ChatGPT with a formula such as the following: <strong class="source-inline">Tell me about the airplane model Aircraft operated by Operator in three sentences</strong> Here is an example using data from a single row of the FAA Wildlife <span class="No-Break">Strike database:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer200" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_12.05_B19500.jpg" alt="Figure 12.5 – Information about an airplane in the fleet of an operator as described by OpenAI ChatGPT"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.5 – Information about an airplane in the fleet of an operator as described by OpenAI ChatGPT</p>
			<p>From a prompt engineering perspective, asking this question for multiple reports in the FAA Wildlife Strike database would require running the following natural language query on each row of data (column names are depicted <span class="No-Break">inside brackets):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Tell me about the airplane model [Aircraft] operated by<strong class="source-inline"> </strong>[Operator] in three sentences:</pre>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will use this prompt for reports in the FAA Wildlife Strike database in which the <strong class="bold">Aircraft</strong> and <strong class="bold">Operator</strong> fields are populated. After selecting a use case for <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>augmenting your solution with additional information via OpenAI, it is recommended that you obtain approval from stakeholders to verify the practicality of the use case. Once approved, you can proceed with exploring new use cases that involve utilizing OpenAI to generate summaries of data derived from FAA Wildlife Strike data within <span class="No-Break">your solution.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Summarizing data with OpenAI</h1>
			<p>You can also use OpenAI GPT models to summarize data. Numerous databases feature free text fields <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>that comprise entries from a diverse array <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>of sources, including survey results, physician notes, feedback forms, and comments regarding incident reports for the FAA Wildlife Strike database that we have used in this book. These text entry fields represent a wide range of content, from structured data to unstructured data, making it challenging to extract meaning from them without the assistance of sophisticated natural language <span class="No-Break">processing tools.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Remarks</strong> field of the FAA Wildlife Strike database contains text that was presumably entered by people involved in filling out incident forms about aircraft striking wildlife. A few examples of the remarks for recent entries are shown in Power BI in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer201" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_12.06_B19500.jpg" alt="Figure 12.6 – Examples of remarks from the FAA Wildlife Strike database"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6 – Examples of remarks from the FAA Wildlife Strike database</p>
			<p>You will notice that the remarks have a great deal of variability in the format of the content, the <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>length of the content, and the acronyms that <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>were used. Testing one of the entries by simply adding a statement at the beginning to <strong class="source-inline">Summarize the following:</strong> yields the <span class="No-Break">following result:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer202" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.8 – Summarization of a sparsely populated results field</p>
			<p>In order to obtain uniform summaries from the FAA Wildlife Strike data’s <strong class="bold">Remarks</strong> field, one must consider entries that vary in robustness, sparsity, completeness of sentences, and <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>the presence of acronyms and quick notes. The <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>workshop accompanying this technical book is your chance to experiment with various data fields and explore diverse outcomes. Both the book and the Packt GitHub site will utilize a standardized format as input to a GPT model that can incorporate event data and produce a consistent summary for each row. An example of the format is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Summarize the following in three sentences: A [Operator] [Aircraft] struck a [Species]. Remarks on the FAA report were: [Remarks].</pre>
			<p>Using data from an FAA Wildlife Strike database event to test this approach in OpenAI ChatGPT is shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer204" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.9 – OpenAI ChatGPT testing a summarization of the Remarks field</p>
			<p>Next, you test <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>another scenario that had more robust <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>text in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Remarks</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> field:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.10 – Another scenario with robust remarks tested using OpenAI ChatGPT</p>
			<p>Based upon the results of your preliminary testing using OpenAI ChatGPT, you decide to move forward with both the text generation and summarization use cases used previously. First, <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>you will get approval from your stakeholders, and <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>then you will begin development. Before you begin developing the use cases in Power BI, you’ll need to decide upon the GPT models for your API calls. Both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI support the use of REST APIs to call GPT models. These APIs will be used to generate text for each row of data that you want to use for description generations <span class="No-Break">and summarizations.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Choosing GPT models for your use cases</h1>
			<p>OpenAI and Azure OpenAI offer several different GPT models that can be called iteratively using <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>an API. At the time of writing this book, there is limited availability of the new GPT-4 models, which are the latest and greatest releases. The GPT-3.5 models are available in both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, with a few different options.

			<p>For the next chapter in the book, you decide to use <strong class="source-inline">text-davinci-003</strong> to generate new descriptions about airplanes and summarizing remarks about wildlife strike incidents. Is it <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>the best choice? You would need to do extensive testing and also choose specific criteria for what is best, and these are brand-new technologies without a historical body of standards from which to set baselines. For this book and workshop, you will make this choice to keep things moving along with a GPT model that should provide <span class="No-Break">reasonable results.</span></p>
			<p>The API calls can also be configured using additional settings. Settings such as <strong class="source-inline">temperature</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">top_p</strong> can change the results from leaning toward simplicity and straight fact to more creative answers. Be careful with these settings, as creativity in results can <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>cause incorrect answers, which are referred to <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">hallucinations</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you have delved into the fundamental concepts associated with OpenAI and Microsoft Azure OpenAI, and how these platforms can be employed to generate and summarize text. Moreover, you have explored several options for integrating GPT models from both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI into your Power BI solution using FAA Wildlife Strike data. Following a careful evaluation process, it has been determined that the <strong class="source-inline">text-davinci-003</strong> GPT model will be utilized for the summarization of remarks present in FAA Wildlife Strike data reports, and for generating novel descriptive information about airplanes within <span class="No-Break">the reports.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19500_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a> will be dedicated to the implementation of functions within Power BI dataflows, enabling the seamless calling of OpenAI and Azure OpenAI REST APIs for data. These APIs will facilitate the successful implementation of your summarization and descriptive generation use cases, thereby providing new capabilities for your solution to address the challenges posed by FAA Wildlife Strike data. With these advanced features in place, your dataflows will be able to call upon OpenAI or Azure OpenAI with ease and efficiency each time they <span class="No-Break">are refreshed.</span></p>
			<p>This integration of cutting-edge functionalities within your project will undoubtedly bolster its efficacy, providing a streamlined and optimized approach to data summarization and <span class="No-Break">descriptive generation.</span></p>
