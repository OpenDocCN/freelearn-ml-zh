    Learning** enables you to perform predictive analytics with the application of
    machine learning. Traditionally, it has been an area for experts. Developing and
    deploying a predictive modeling solution using machine learning has never been
    simple and easy, even for experts. Microsoft seems to have taken most of the pain
    out with this new cloud-based offering that allows you to develop and deploy a
    predictive solution in the simplest and quickest possible way. Even beginners
    would find it easy and simple to understand.

    predictions of unknown events that may or may not be in future. One example of
    this would be to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not before the flight
    takes off. You should not misunderstand that predictive analytics only deals with
    future events. It can be any concerned event, for example, an event where you
    need to predict whether a given credit card transaction is a fraud or not when
    the transaction has already taken place. In this case, the event has already taken
    place. Similarly, If you are given some properties of soil, and you need to predict
    a certain other chemical property of soil, then you are actually predicting something
    that is present.'

    solutions they are seeking? This may lead you to a solution that lies in predictive
    analytics. Then, you need to translate the business problem in an analytics problem,
    for example, the business might be interested in giving a boost to the catalog
    sales for the existing customers. So, your problem might get translated to predict
    the number of widgets a customer would buy if you know the demographic information
    about them, such as their age, gender, income, location, and so on, or the price
    of an item, given their purchase history of the past several years. While defining
    the problem, you also need to define the scope of the project; otherwise, it might
    end up in a never-ending process.

    data, and so on. Again, data may not be present in the proper format, as you would
    need it to make predictions. So, you may need some preprocessing to get the data
    in the desired shape. Often, people call it **data wrangling**. After this, you
    can either select or extract the exact features that lead you to the prediction.

    For example, for an e-commerce company, a prediction model might recommend products
    for a prospective customer visiting the website. In another example, after you
    have built a model to predict the sales volume for the year, different sales departments
    across different locations might need to use it to make the forecasts for their
    region. In such scenarios, you have to deploy your trained model as a web service
    or in some other type of production, so that others can consume it either by a
    custom application, **Microsoft Excel**, or a similar tool.

    of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    To simplify it, machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the
    construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms
    operate by building a model from example inputs and use that model to make predictions
    or decisions rather than following strictly static program instructions.

    about age, education, gender, and annual income of a sufficiently large number
    of people. Suppose you are interested in predicting someone's income. So, you
    will build a model by choosing a machine learning algorithm and train the model
    with the dataset. After you train your model, it can then predict the income of
    a new person if you provide it with age, education, and gender data. To explain
    it further, you have not programmed something explicitly, such as if a male's
    age is greater than 50 and whether he has a master's degree, then he would earn
    say $100,000 per annum. However, what you did was just choose a generic algorithm
    and gave it the data, so that it discovers all the relationships between the different
    variables or features (here, age, gender, and education) with the target variable
    income. So, the algorithm learned from the data and hence got trained. Now, with
    the trained algorithm, you can predict someone's income if you know their other
    variables.

    Machine Learning**. It works as shown in the following figure:'

    or the concept of training data or examples, so here, the prediction is also of
    a different kind. Consider the same dataset again that contains data of age, gender,
    education, and income of a sufficiently large number of people. You have to run
    a targeted marketing campaign, so you have to divide or group the people into
    three clusters. In this case as well, you can use a different kind of machine
    learning generic algorithm on the dataset that would automatically group the people
    into three groups or clusters. This kind of machine learning is known as **unsupervised
    machine learning**.

    as Bing or Google are powered by Machine Learning or applications, so also personal
    digital assistants like Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri. These days, driverless
    cars are also in the news, which use machine learning. So, such applications are

    divided into two or more classes and the learner produces a model that assigns
    unknown inputs to one (or multi-label classification) or more of these classes
    or labels. This is typically handled in a supervised way. Spam detection is an
    example of classification, where the inputs or examples are e-mail (or other)
    messages and the classes are "spam" and "not spam" and the model to predict a
    new e-mail as spam or not are based on example data.'

    features or dependent variables and associated target values. A simple example
    can be where you have historical data of the price paid for different properties
    in your locality for say the last 5 years. Here, the price paid is the target
    variable and the different attributes of a property, such as the total built-up
    area; the type of property, such as a flat or semi-detached house; and so on,
    are different features or variables. A regression problem would be to predict
    the property price of a new property available in the market for sale.'

    them into different clusters say 1, 2, and 3, which were not known previously.
    The clustering problem is fundamentally different from the classification problem.
    The classification problem is a supervised learning problem where your class or
    target variable is known to train a dataset, whereas in clustering, there is no
    concept of label and training data. It works on all the data, and groups them
    into different clusters.'

    as a categorical variable, and you have to predict the target variable for a new
    dataset based on the given dataset (example), then this is a classification problem.
    If you are just given a dataset with no label or target variable and you just
    have to group them into *n* clusters, then it's a clustering case.
