			<p>Data visualization is an art! No matter how much effort you and your team put into data preparation and preliminary analysis for modeling, if you don’t know how to show your findings effectively, your audience may not understand the point you are trying <span class="No-Break">to make.</span></p>
			<p>Often, such situations may be even worse when you are dealing with decision-makers. For example, if you choose the wrong set of charts to tell a particular story, people can misinterpret your analysis and make <span class="No-Break">bad decisions.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding the different types of data visualizations, and knowing how they fit with each type of analysis, will put you in a very good position in terms of engaging your audience and transmitting the information <span class="No-Break">you want.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about some data visualization techniques. You will be covering the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visualizing relationships in <span class="No-Break">your data</span></li>
				<li>Visualizing comparisons in <span class="No-Break">your data</span></li>
				<li>Visualizing compositions in <span class="No-Break">your data</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor639"/><a id="_idTextAnchor640"/>Visualizing relationships in your data</h1>
			<p>When <a id="_idTextAnchor641"/>you need to show relationships in your data, you are usually talking about plotting two or more variables in a chart to visualize their level of dependency. A <strong class="bold">scatter plot</strong> is probably <a id="_idTextAnchor642"/>the most common type of chart to show the relationship between two variables. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> shows a scatter plot for two variables, X <span class="No-Break">and Y.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – Plotting relationships with a scatter plot</p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> shows a clear relationship between <em class="italic">X</em> and <em class="italic">Y</em>. As <em class="italic">X</em> increases, <em class="italic">Y</em> also increases. In this p<a id="_idTextAnchor644"/>articular case, you can say that there is a linear relationship between both variables. Keep in mind that scatter plots may also catch other types of relationships, not only linear ones. For example, it would also be possible to find an exponential relationship between the <span class="No-Break">two variables.</span></p>
			<p>Another nice chart to make comparisons with i<a id="_idTextAnchor645"/>s the <strong class="bold">bubble chart</strong>. Just like a scatter plot, it will also show the relationship between variables; however, here, you can use a third dimension, which will be represented by the size of <span class="No-Break">the point.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> is a bubble chart that explains an investment schema, where the <em class="italic">x</em> axis is the annual rate, <em class="italic">y</em> is the investment period, and the size of the bubble indicates the amount allocated to each <span class="No-Break">investment option.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Plotting relationships with a bubble chart</p>
			<p>Looking at <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, you can see two types of relationships. The first one is the relationship between the annual rate and investment period: the longer the investment period, the hi<a id="_idTextAnchor647"/>gher your annual rate. The second one is the relationship between the amount invested and the annual rate: the higher the amount invested, the higher your annual rate. As you can see, this is a very effective way to present this type of analysis. Next, you will learn how to <span class="No-Break">compare variables.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117">Vi<a id="_idTextAnchor648"/><a id="_idTextAnchor649"/>sualizing comparisons in your data</h1>
			<p>Comparisons are ve<a id="_idTextAnchor650"/>ry common in data analysis and there are different ways to present them. Starting with the <strong class="bold">bar chart</strong>, you must have seen many reports that have used this type <span class="No-Break">of visualization.</span></p>
			<p>Bar charts ca<a id="_idTextAnchor651"/>n be used to compare one variable among different classes – for example, a car’s price across different models or population size per country. In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>, the bar chart is used to analyze the percentage of positive tests for COVID-19 in a range of regions of India as of April <span class="No-Break">7</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="superscript">th</span></span><span class="No-Break">, 2020.</span></p>

			<p>Sometimes, you can also use <strong class="bold">stacked column charts</strong> to add ano<a id="_idTextAnchor653"/>ther dimension to the data that is bei<a id="_idTextAnchor654"/>ng analyzed. For example, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> uses a stacked bar chart to show how many people were on board the Titanic by sex. Additionally, it breaks down the number of people who survived (positive class) and those who did not (negative class), also <span class="No-Break">by sex.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – Using a stacked bar chart to analyze the Titanic disaster dataset</p>
			<p>As you can see, most of t<a id="_idTextAnchor655"/>he women survived the disaster, while most of the men did not. The stacked bars help us visualize the difference between the fates of the sexes. Finally, you should know that you can also show percentages on those stacked bars, not just <span class="No-Break">absolute numbers.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Column</strong> <strong class="bold">charts</strong> are also usef<a id="_idTextAnchor656"/>ul if you need to compare one or two variables across different periods. For example, in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>, you can see the annual Canadian electronic vehicle sales <span class="No-Break">by province.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – Plotting comparisons with a column chart (source: <a href="https://electrek.co/">https://electrek.co/</a>)</p>
			<p>Another very effective way t<a id="_idTextAnchor657"/>o make comparisons across different periods is by using <strong class="bold">line</strong> <strong class="bold">charts</strong>. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> shows a pretty interesting examp<a id="_idTextAnchor658"/>le of how you can compare different algorithms’ performance, in a particular project, across different <span class="No-Break">release dates.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Line charts are usually very helpful to indicate whether there is any trend in the data over the period of time under analysis. A very common use case for line charts is forecasting, where you u<a id="_idTextAnchor659"/>sually have to analyze trends and seasonality in time <span class="No-Break">series data.</span></p>
			<p>For example, in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> you can s<a id="_idTextAnchor660"/>ee that the <strong class="bold">Classification and Regression Trees (CART)</strong> model used to be<a id="_idTextAnchor661"/> the poorest perfo<a id="_idTextAnchor662"/>rmant model compa<a id="_idTextAnchor663"/>red to other algor<a id="_idTextAnchor664"/>ithms, such as <strong class="bold">AdaBoost (ADA), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and logistic </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">regression (LOGIT).</strong></span></p>
			<p>However, in July, the CART model was optimized, and it turned out to be the third-best model across all other models. The whole story about the best model for each period can easily be seen in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.6</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – Plotting comparisons with a line chart</p>
			<p>Finally, you can also show c<a id="_idTextAnchor665"/>omparisons of your data using tables. Tables are more u<a id="_idTextAnchor666"/>seful when you have multiple dimensions (usually placed in the rows of the table) and one or multiple metrics to make comparisons against (usually placed in the columns of <span class="No-Break">the table).</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, you will le<a id="_idTextAnchor667"/>arn about another set of charts that aims to show the distribution of your variables. This set of charts is particularly important for modeling tasks, since you must know the distribution of a feature to think about potential data transformations <span class="No-Break">for it.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118">Visual<a id="_idTextAnchor668"/><a id="_idTextAnchor669"/>izing distributions in your data</h1>
			<p>Exploring the distri<a id="_idTextAnchor670"/>bution of your feature is very important to understand some key characteristics of it, such as its skewness, mean, median, and quantiles. You can easily visualize skewness by plotting a histogram. This type of chart groups your data into bins or buckets and performs counts on top of them. For example, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> shows a histogram for the <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">age</em></span><span class="No-Break"> variable:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – Plotting distributions with a histogram</p>
			<p>Looking at the histogr<a id="_idTextAnchor671"/>am, you could conclude that most of the people are between 20 and 50 years old. You can also see a few people more than 60 years old. Another example of a histogram is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em>, which plots the distribution of payments from a particular event that has different ticket prices. It aims to analyze how much money people are paying <span class="No-Break">per ticket.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B21197_05_08.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – Checking skewness with a histogram" width="1092" height="628"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.8 – Checking skewness with a histogram</p>
			<p>Here, you can see that mos<a id="_idTextAnchor672"/>t of the people are paying a maximum of 100 dollars per ticket. That is the reason why you can see a skewed distribution to the right-hand side (the <span class="No-Break">tail side).</span></p>
			<p>If you want to see other characteristics of the distribution, such as its median, quantiles, and outliers, then you should u<a id="_idTextAnchor673"/>se box plots. In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em>, there is another performance comparison of different algorithms in a <span class="No-Break">given dataset.</span></p>
			<p>These algorithms were executed many times, in a cross-validation process, which resulted in multiple outputs for the same algorithm; for example, one accuracy metric for each execution of the algorithm on <span class="No-Break">each fold.</span></p>
			<p>Since there are multiple accuracy metrics for each algorithm, you can use a box plot to check how each of those algorithms performed during the <span class="No-Break">cross-validation process.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure <a id="_idTextAnchor674"/>5.9 – Plotting distributions with a box plot</p>
			<p>Here, you can see that box <a id="_idTextAnchor675"/>plots can present some information about the distribution of the data, such as its median, lower quartile, upper quartile, and outliers. For a complete understanding of each element of a box plot, take a look at <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.10</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5<a id="_idTextAnchor676"/>.10 – Box plot elements</p>
			<p>By analyzing the box plot shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em>, you could conclude that the ADA algorithm has presented some outliers during the cross-validation process, since one of the executions resulted in a very good model (around 92% accuracy). All the other executions of AdaBoost resulted in less than 85% accuracy, with a median value of <span class="No-Break">around 80%.</span></p>
			<p>Another conclusion you could make after analyzing <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em> is that the CART algorithm presented the poorest performance during the cross-validation process (the lowest median and <span class="No-Break">lower quartile).</span></p>
			<p>Before you wrap up this secti<a id="_idTextAnchor677"/>on, note that you can also use a scatter plot to analyze data distributions when you have more than one variable. Next, you will look at another set of charts that is useful for showing compositions in <span class="No-Break">your data.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119">Visualizin<a id="_idTextAnchor678"/><a id="_idTextAnchor679"/>g compositions in your data</h1>
			<p>Sometimes, you want to an<a id="_idTextAnchor680"/>alyze the various elements that compose a feature – for example, the percentage of sales per region or percentage of queries per channel. In both examples, they are not considering any time dimension; instead, they are just looking at the entire data points. For these types of compositions, where you don’t have the time dimension, you could show your data using <strong class="bold">pie charts, stacked 100% bar charts, and </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">tree maps.</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.11</em> is a pie chart showing the number of queries per customer channel for a given company over a pre-defined period <span class="No-Break">of time.</span></p>

			<p>As you can see, stacked 100% column chart<a id="_idTextAnchor684"/>s help us understand compositions across <span class="No-Break">different periods.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120">Building key<a id="_idTextAnchor685"/><a id="_idTextAnchor686"/> performance indicators</h1>
			<p>Before you wrap up <a id="_idTextAnchor687"/>these data visualization sections, you need to be introduced to <strong class="bold">key</strong> <strong class="bold">performance indicators</strong>, or <strong class="bold">KPIs </strong><span class="No-Break">for short.</span></p>
			<p>A KPI is usual<a id="_idTextAnchor688"/>ly a single value that describes the results of a business indicator, such as the churn rate, <strong class="bold">net promoter score (NPS), return on investment (ROI),</strong> and so on. Although<a id="_idTextAnchor689"/> there are some standard indicators across different industries, you usually need to build custom metrics based on the <span class="No-Break">company’s needs.</span></p>
			<p>To be honest, the most complex challenge associated with indicators is not in their visualization aspect itself, but in the way they have been built (the rules used) and the way they will be communicated and used across different levels of <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<p>From a visualization perspective, just like any other single value, you can use all those charts that you have learned about to analyze your indicator, depending on your need. However, if you just want to show your KPI, with no time dimension, you can use <span class="No-Break">a </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">widget</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Alright, these are the most important topics about data visualization that you should know for the AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty exam. Now, let us have a look at QuickSight, an AWS service where you can implement all these visualization techniques you have <span class="No-Break">just learned.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121">Introducing <a id="_idTextAnchor690"/><a id="_idTextAnchor691"/>QuickSight</h1>
			<p>Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based <a id="_idTextAnchor692"/>analytics service that allows you to build data visualizations and ad hoc analysis. QuickSight supports a variety of data sources, such as Redshift, Aurora, Athena, RDS, and your on-premises <span class="No-Break">database solution.</span></p>
			<p>Other sources of data include S3, where you can retrieve data from Ex<a id="_idTextAnchor693"/>cel, CSV, or log files, and <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong> solutions, where you can retrieve data from <span class="No-Break">Salesforce entities.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon QuickSight has <span class="No-Break">two versions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Standard edition</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Enterprise edition</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The most important difference between these two versions is the possibility of integration with Microso<a id="_idTextAnchor694"/>ft <strong class="bold">Active Directory (AD)</strong> and encryption at rest. Both features are only provided in the <span class="No-Break">Enterprise edition.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Keep in mind that AWS services are constantly evolving, so more differences between the Standard and Enterprise versions may crop up in the future. You should always consult the latest documentation of AWS services to check what <span class="No-Break">is new.</span></p>
			<p>In terms of access management, QuickSight offers a very simple interface you can use to control user access. In the Standard edition, you have pretty much two options for inviting a user to your <span class="No-Break">QuickSight account:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can invite an <span class="No-Break">IAM user.</span></li>
				<li>You can send an invitation to an <span class="No-Break">email address.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you invite IAM users, then they can automatically log in to your account and see or edit your visualization, depending on the type of permission you have provided during QuickSight user creation. If you have invited an email address, then the email owner has to access their mailbox to complete <span class="No-Break">this operation.</span></p>
			<p>Removing a user is also straightforward. The only extra information you have to provide while removing a user is whether you want to transfer the orphaned resources to another user into your account <em class="italic">or</em> delete all the <span class="No-Break">user’s resources.</span></p>
			<p>If you are playing with the Enterprise e<a id="_idTextAnchor695"/>dition, this process of authorizing users can be a little different, since you have AD working for you. In this case, you can grant access to AD groups, and all the users from those groups will be granted access to your account <span class="No-Break">on QuickSight.</span></p>
			<p>Also, remember that in both versions, all data transfer is encrypted; however, you will only find encryption at rest in the <span class="No-Break">Enterprise edition.</span></p>
			<p>When you are bringing data into QuickSight, you are technically creating what are known as <strong class="bold">datasets</strong>. Datasets, in turn, are imported in an optimized structure into QuickSi<a id="_idTextAnchor696"/>ght, known as the <strong class="bold">Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory, Calculation Engine (SPICE)</strong>. That is why QuickSight can perform data visualization on <span class="No-Break">big data.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, you should know that QuickSight does not only allow you to plot your data, but also perform some small data preparation tasks, such as renaming fields, computing new fields, changing data types, preparing queries to retrieve data from the source, and joining tables from the <span class="No-Break">same source.</span></p>
			<p>Summarizing the main steps for working <span class="No-Break">with QuickSight:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>User creation <span class="No-Break">and authorization.</span></li>
				<li>Connecting to a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">data source.</strong></span></li>
				<li>Bringing data into <span class="No-Break">a </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">dataset</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Your dataset will be imported <span class="No-Break">into </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SPICE</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>From a dataset, you can create <span class="No-Break">an </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">analysis</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, inside your analysis, you can <span class="No-Break">add </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">visuals</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>If you want to go further, you can create a snapshot of your analysis and place it in a <strong class="bold">dashboard</strong>. Alternatively, you can group your analysis <span class="No-Break">into </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">stories</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>That brings you to the end of this chapter<a id="_idTextAnchor697"/> about data visualizations! Now, take some time to recap what you <span class="No-Break">have learned.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor698"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>You <a id="_idTextAnchor699"/><a id="_idTextAnchor700"/>started this chapter by learning how to visualize relationships in the data. Scatter plots and bubble charts are the most important charts in this category to show relationships between two or three <span class="No-Break">variables, respectively.</span></p>
			<p>Then, you moved to another category of data visualization, which aimed to make comparisons in the data. The most common charts that you can use to show comparisons are bar charts, column charts, and line charts. Tables are also useful to <span class="No-Break">show comparisons.</span></p>
			<p>The next use case that you learned was visualizing data distributions. The most common types of charts that are used to show distributions are histograms and <span class="No-Break">box plots.</span></p>
			<p>Then, you moved to compositions. You can use this set of charts when you want to show the different elements that make up the data. While showing compositions, you must be aware of whether you want to present static data or data that changes over time. For static data, you should use a pie chart, a stacked 100% bar chart, or a tree map. For data that changes over time, you should use a stacked area chart, a stacked 100% area chart, a stacked column chart, or a stacked 100% <span class="No-Break">column chart.</span></p>
			<p>The last section of this chapter was reserved for QuickSight, which is an AWS service that you can use to visualize your data. You learned about the different versions and features of the service, and you were then introduced <span class="No-Break">to SPICE.</span></p>
			<p>Well done! In the next chapter, you will learn about machine learning algorithms. That is going to be a very important chapter for your certification journey, so make sure you are prepared! However, before you jump into that new chapter, take some time to practice a little more for <span class="No-Break">the exam!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor701"/>Exam Readiness Drill – Chapter Review Questions</h1>
			<p>Apart from a solid understanding of key concepts, being able to think quickly under time pressure is a skill that will help you ace your certification exam. That is why working on these skills early on in your learning journey <span class="No-Break">is key.</span></p>
			<p>Chapter review questions are designed to improve your test-taking skills progressively with each chapter you learn and review your understanding of key concepts in the chapter at the same time. You’ll find these at the end of <span class="No-Break">each chapter.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor702"/>Exam Readiness Drill</h2>
			<p>For the first three attempts, don’t worry about the <span class="No-Break">time limit.</span></p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor703"/>ATTEMPT 1</h3>
			<p>The first time, aim for at least <strong class="bold">40%</strong>. Look at the answers you got wrong and read the relevant sections in the chapter again to fix your <span class="No-Break">learning gaps.</span></p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor704"/>ATTEMPT 2</h3>
			<p>The second time, aim for at least <strong class="bold">60%</strong>. Look at the answers you got wrong and read the relevant sections in the chapter again to fix any remaining <span class="No-Break">learning gaps.</span></p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor705"/>ATTEMPT 3</h3>
			<p>The third time, aim for at least <strong class="bold">75%</strong>. Once you score 75% or more, you start working on <span class="No-Break">your timing.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You may take more than <strong class="bold">three</strong> attempts to reach 75%. That’s okay. Just review the relevant sections in the chapter till you <span class="No-Break">get there.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor706"/>Working On Timing</h1>
			<p>Target: Your aim is to keep the score the same while trying to answer these questions as quickly as possible. Here’s an example of how your next attempts should <span class="No-Break">look like:</span></p>
