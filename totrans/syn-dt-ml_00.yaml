    our world without ML-based products and services. ML models need to be trained
    on large-scale datasets to perform well. However, collecting and annotating real
    data is extremely expensive, error-prone, and subject to privacy issues, to name
    a few disadvantages. Synthetic data is a promising solution to real-data ML-based
    solutions.'
