			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In the preceding chapters, you created a chatbot using the Amazon Lex service, named <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong>. This chatbot receives input from you about a stock ticker symbol and then, relays that information to a Lambda function, which then goes out to an external <strong class="inline">API</strong> and retrieves that information. The Lambda function then sends this information back to the chatbot, which in turn provides it to you by means of conversational text and speech interfaces.</p>
			<p>You have already used a text interface before, and in the following chapter you learned how to set up a voice-based call center using the Amazon Connect service. You created a contact flow and populated it with the appropriate nodes and properties for those nodes to connect to your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot and allow anyone to converse with the chatbot through a voice interface that's available by dialing a local phone number!</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will use the <strong class="bold">Amazon Rekognition service</strong> to perform various image processing tasks. First, you will identify objects and scenes within images. Then, you will test whether images may be flagged as needing content moderation. Next, you will analyze faces using Rekognition. You will also recognize celebrities and well-known people in images. You will compare faces that appear in different images and settings (for example, in groups or in isolation) and recognize the same people in different images. Finally, you will extract text from images that might have some text displayed in them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Amazon Rekognition Basics</h2>
			<p>Amazon Rekognition is a service from AWS that allows you to perform image analysis using machine learning. It is built on the same scalable infrastructure as AWS itself, and uses deep learning technology to be able to analyze billions of images daily if required. It is also being updated constantly by Amazon and learning new labels and features.</p>
			<p>Some of the use cases for Amazon Rekognition are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Searching across your library of image content with text keywords.</li>
				<li>Confirm user identities by comparing live images with reference ones.</li>
				<li>Analyze trends based on public images, including the sentiments and emotions of the people in the images.</li>
				<li>Detect explicit and suggestive content and automatically filter it for your purposes</li>
				<li>Retrieve text from images.<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">Amazon Rekognition is also an <strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong> Eligible Service for healthcare applications. If you wish to protect your data under HIPAA, you will need to contact Amazon Customer Support and fill out a Business Associate Addendum (BAA). For more information about HIPAA, go to the following link: <a href="">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Free Tier Information on Amazon Rekognition</h3>
			<p>In this book, you will only be using the free tier of the services presented. However, it is important to be aware of the limits of free usage and pricing. For image processing, you can receive the following services for free:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Upon joining, new Amazon Rekognition clients can break down up to 5,000 pictures initially a year. </li>
				<li>You can utilize all Amazon Rekognition APIs with this complementary plan, and furthermore put away up to 1,000 faces free of charge.<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">You should not need to use more than, if you go beyond the limits of the free tier, you will get charged by Amazon at rates published at this link: <a href="">https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Rekognition and Deep Learning</h2>
			<p>Deep learning is a significant sub-field of machine learning and a branch of artificial intelligence. The way in which deep learning works is by inferring high-level abstractions from raw data by using a deep graph with many layers of processing. </p>
			<p>Deep learning structures, for example, <strong class="bold">Convolutional deep Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNNs</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">RNNs</strong>) have been connected to computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and audio recognition to deliver results.</p>
			<p>The Rekognition service employs deep learning in order to provide its various features behind the scenes. It uses pre-trained models so that users do not have to train the system. The exact details are proprietary and confidential to Amazon, but we can see how it works and how to use Rekognition in this chapter.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Detect Objects and Scenes in Images</h3>
			<p>Amazon Rekognition provides a feature that can detect objects and scenes in an image and label them. The label may be an object, scene or concept such as <strong class="bold">Person</strong>, <strong class="bold">Water</strong>, <strong class="bold">Sand</strong>, <strong class="bold">Beach</strong> (scene) and <strong class="bold">Outdoors</strong> (concept).</p>
			<p>Each label comes with a confidence score, which measures, on a scale from 0 to 100, the probability that the service got the correct answer for that label. This allows you or your application to judge for itself the threshold against which to allow or discard results.</p>
			<p>Rekognition supports thousands of labels from categories such as those shown in the following table:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer226">
					<img alt="Figure 6.1: Labels supported by Amazon Rekognition &#13;&#10;" src="image/Image_Lesson6_001.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 6.1: Labels supported by Amazon Rekognition </h6>
			<p>Additionally, Amazon is continuously training the system to recognize new ones, and you can request labels that you might wish to use which are not in the system through <strong class="bold">Amazon Customer Support</strong>.</p>
			<p>To create an Amazon Rekognition of a sample image, you can do the following: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to the Amazon Rekognition service web page in the AWS Console:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer227"><img alt="Figure 6.2: Selecting the Rekognition service in the AWS Console.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0023.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.2: Selecting the Rekognition service in the AWS Console.</h6></li>
				<li>You can find Rekognition under the <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> section. When you are on the Rekognition page, click on the Object and scene detection link in the left hand side toolbar to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Object and scene detection</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Object</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">Scene detection</strong> link in the toolbar to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Object</strong> and <strong class="bold">Scene detection</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Next, choose the <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> panel. <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540253208288-6a6c32573092?w=800</a><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer228"><img alt="Figure 6.3: Use image URL input text box.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0034.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.3: Use image URL input text box.</h6><p>The result for the image is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer229"><img alt="Figure 6.4: Results for the sample image.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0043.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.4: Results for the sample image.</h6></li>
				<li>You can see that within the image, the objects that have been detected with a 93.1% confidence are as follows:<ul><li>Dawn</li><li>Dusk</li><li>Nature</li><li>Outdoors</li><li>Red Sky</li><li>Sky</li></ul></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Show more</strong> link to show more results with lower confidence levels. This will show more objects have been detected:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer230"><img alt="Figure 6.5: Full set of labels for sample image.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0054.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.5: Full set of labels for sample image.</h6></li>
				<li>You can choose the threshold amount of the confidence level at which you would like to cut off the results for your own application.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Exercise 21: Detecting Objects and Scenes using your own images</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will detect objects and scenes of custom images using Amazon Rekognition. The custom images can be referred from site, or you can upload them from your local machine. The following are the steps for detecting objects and scenes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Navigate to the Amazon Rekognition service page in the AWS Console or go directly to the URL <a href="">https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition</a>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Object</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">Scene detection</strong> link in the toolbar to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Object</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">Scene detection</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Next, choose the <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own Image panel</strong>.</li>
				<li>Enter the following URL so that you have an image to analyze: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522874160750-0faa95a48073?w=800</a>.</li>
				<li>The following is the image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer231"><img alt="The first image that's provided.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0063.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.6: The first image that's provided.</h6><h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">We have collected images from a stock photo site called <a href="">https://unsplash.com/</a> , which has photos that are available for free to download and use without restrictions for the purpose of this book. Always obey copyright laws and be mindful of any restrictions or licensing fees that might apply in the jurisdiction where you reside (if applicable). You may view the license for images from unsplash.com here: <a href="">https://unsplash.com/license</a> .</p></li>
				<li>You may view the results of the object detection under the <strong class="bold">Results</strong> panel on the right-hand side of the image. In this case, it is an image of a camera, and the results should look as follows:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer232"><img alt="Figure 6.6: Results for the first provided image.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0073.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.7: Results for the first image provided.</h6></li>
				<li>As you can see, the results are quite accurate. Next, you can try the following images and verify that the results are as shown in the tables that immediately follow each image.<a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517941875027-6321f98198ed?w=800</a> and <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1500111709600-7761aa8216c7?w=800</a> </li>
				<li>The following is the image:</li>

			<p>In addition to object and scene detection, Rekognition also provides the ability to filter out objectionable content. You can use moderation labels to give point by point sub-classifications, enabling you to tweak the channels that you use to figure out what sorts of pictures you consider satisfactory or shocking. <strong class="bold">Amazon Rekognition Image</strong> provides the <strong class="inline">DetectModerationLabels</strong> operation to detect unsafe content in images.</p>
			<p>You can utilize this component to enhance photograph sharing destinations, gatherings, dating applications, content stages for youngsters, online business stages and commercial centers, and more. In this book, we will not use any adult or nude images, but we can show the use of this feature with content which may be considered racy or suggestive in some locales featuring women in revealing clothing such as swimsuits or club wear. </p>
			<p>The images are blurred by default in this section so you do not have to view them unless you press the View Content button.</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">If you find any racy or suggestive images offensive, please skip this section based on your own personal, moral, religious, or cultural norms.</p>
			<p>Amazon Rekognition uses a hierarchical taxonomy to label categories of explicit and suggestive content. The two top-level categories are <strong class="bold">Explicit Nudity</strong> and <strong class="bold">Suggestive</strong>. Each top-level category has a number of second-level categories. The types of content which are detected and flagged using this feature are as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer237">
					<img alt="Figure 6.11: Content type categories&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0123.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 6.12: Content type categories</h6>
			<p>To create an <strong class="bold">Image Moderation</strong> of a sample image, you can do the following: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Navigate to the Amazon Rekognition service page in the AWS Console or go directly to the URL <a href="">https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition</a>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Image Moderation</strong> link in the toolbar to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Image Moderation</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Next, choose the <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> <strong class="bold">panel</strong>.</li>
				<li>Enter the following URL of an image to analyze: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512101176959-c557f3516787?w=800.</a></li>
				<li>You will notice right away that the content is blurred. The image being analyzed is the first image to the left, which is already selected. You will see that the service has correctly identified Suggestive content in the image of type <strong class="bold">Female Swimwear or Underwear</strong> with a confidence of <strong class="bold">98.4%</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Exercise 22: Detecting objectionable content in images</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will detect objectionable content in images. Now, you can try this service on your own images. We have selected three images that we will try out with this feature:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Copy and paste or type the following <strong class="inline">URL</strong> into the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text box under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> section at the bottom of the page, and press the <strong class="bold">Go</strong> button to receive results from the service: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525287957446-e64af7954611?w=800</a>.<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer239"><img alt="Figure 6.13: Use image URL upload text box.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0035.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.14: Use image URL upload text box.</h6></li>
				<li>You should receive a result stating that the service has found Female Swimwear or Underwear content with a <strong class="bold">98.4%</strong> degree of confidence:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer240"><img alt="Figure 6.14: Result that the service has found&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0143.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.15: Result that the service has found</h6></li>
				<li>The following image <strong class="inline">URL</strong> to provide to the service is: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509670811615-bb8b07cb3caf?w=800</a>.</li>
				<li>Just as before, enter it in the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text box and press the <strong class="bold">Go</strong> button. This image has no objectionable content:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer241"><img alt="Figure 6.15: First provided image for Image moderation.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0154.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.16: First provided image for Image moderation.</h6></li>
				<li>You should see that <strong class="bold">Rekognition</strong> correctly returns no results:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer242"><img alt="" src="image/image0163.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.17: Results of the first provided image for Image moderation.</h6></li>
				<li>Finally, we will use an image that should, again, return some results: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518489913881-199b7c7a081d?w=800</a>.<p>This one should have again correctly been identified as containing content with Female Swimwear or Underwear with a <strong class="bold">97.1%</strong> degree of confidence:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer243">

			<h6>Figure 6.18: Results of the second provided image for Image moderation.</h6>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Facial Analysis</h3>
			<p>Rekognition can perform more detailed analysis on faces as well. Given an image with a detectable face, it can tell whether the face is male or female, the age range of the face, whether or not the person is smiling and appears to be happy, and whether they are wearing glasses or not.</p>
			<p>It can also detect more detailed information such as whether the eyes and mouth are open or closed, and whether or not the person has a mustache or a beard.</p>
			<p>To create a facial analysis of a sample image, you can do the following: </p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">Click on the Facial analysis link in the left toolbar to navigate to the Facial analysis page.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose the <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Enter the following URL of an image to analyze: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525943837837-af668e09139d?w=800.</a></li>
				<li>For this image, you will see that the main image box displays a bounding rectangle which shows the region in which the face was detected. Within the bounding box, there are also three dots to identify the locations of key facial images: the mouth and nose detection. .<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer244"><img alt="Figure 6.18: First sample image for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0183.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.19: First sample image for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>Under the Results section to the right of the image, you can see that Rekognition has detected the following attributes of the face in the image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer245"><img alt="Figure 6.19: Results of the first sample image for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0194.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.20: Results of the first sample image for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>You can click on the <strong class="bold">Show</strong> more link in order to show the other attributes which have also been identified.</li>
				<li>All these identified qualities have an extremely high degree of confidence, showing that the service is very confident of its findings.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Exercise 23: Analyzing Faces in your Own Images</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, you have been provided with links to three images so that you can try out the service with your own images:</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">Click on the <strong class="bold">Facial analysis</strong> link in the left toolbar to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Facial analysis</strong> page.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The first image to be analyzed is at the following URL: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494790108377-be9c29b29330</a>.</li>
				<li>You can copy and paste or type this <strong class="inline">URL</strong> into the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text box under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> section at the bottom of the page, like so:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer246"><img alt="Figure 6.20: The image URL input text box.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0036.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.21: The image URL input text box.</h6><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer247"><img alt="Figure 6.21: First image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0203.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.22: First image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>You can see from the bounding box and dots that Rekognition is able to recognize the face easily:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer248"><img alt="Figure 6.22: Bounding box for first image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0214.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.23: Bounding box for first image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>Under the <strong class="bold">Results</strong> section, it quite accurately displays the attributes of the face in the image as well:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer249"><img alt="Figure 6.23: Results for first image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0223.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.24: Results for first image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>The second image is a different face, which is also not smiling. You can enter this URL to provide it to Rekognition: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488426862026-3ee34a7d66df?w=800</a>.<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer250"><img alt="Figure 6.24: Second image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0234.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.25: Second image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>Rekognition once again does a good job of identifying the face:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer251"><img alt="Figure 6.25: Bounding box for the second image provided for Facial analysis&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0243.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.26: Bounding box for the second image provided for Facial analysis</h6></li>
				<li>The results also reflect that she is not smiling:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer252"><img alt="Figure 6.26: Results for the second image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0254.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.27: Results for the second image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>Finally, we will give Rekognition an image with a male to see how it does via the following link: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1472099645785-5658abf4ff4e?w=1000</a>.<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer253"><img alt="Figure 6.27: Third image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0262.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.28: Third image pro<a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>vided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>As expected, the service can recognize both males and females. It identifies the face with the bounding box:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer254"><img alt="Figure 6.28: Bounding box for the third image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0275.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.29: Bounding box for the third image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>And it also displays results with a high degree of confidence (99.9%) that the face is male. It also updates the age range accordingly:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer255"><img alt="Figure 6.29: Results for third image provided for Facial analysis.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0283.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.30: Results for third image provided for Facial analysis.</h6></li>
				<li>It is 70.9% confident that the man is smiling, but we can see from the image that he is not smiling very much, if at all.</li>
				<li>Finally, the service is 100% sure that he is wearing glasses and 99% sure that he is not wearing sunglasses, which is a highly accurate description of the image.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Celebrity Recognition</h3>
			<p>Rekognition provides the ability to recognize and label celebrities and other famous people in images. This includes people who are prominent in their field across categories such as politics, sports, business, entertainment, and the media.</p>
			<p>It is important to remember that Rekognition can only recognize faces that it has been trained on, and so does not cover a full, exhaustive list of celebrities. However, since Amazon continues to train the system, it is constantly adding new faces to the service.</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">Click on the Celebrity recognition link in the left toolbar to navigate to the Celebrity recognition page.</p>
			<p>To create a celebrity recognition of a sample image you can do the following: </p>
			<ol>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Face Comparison</h3>
			<p>Rekognition allows you to compare faces in two images. This is mainly for the purpose of identifying which faces are the same in both images. As an example use case, this can also be used for comparing images with people against their personnel photo.</p>
			<p>This section demonstrates industry standards so that you can utilize Amazon Rekognition to analyze faces inside an arrangement of pictures with different faces in them. When you indicate a Reference face (source) and a Comparison face (target) picture, Rekognition thinks about the biggest face in the source picture (that is, the reference confront) with up to 100 countenances recognized in the objective picture (that is, the examination appearances), and after that, discovers how intently the face in the source coordinates the appearances in the objective picture. The closeness score for every examination is shown in the Results sheet.</p>
			<p>Some restrictions on usage the of this feature are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the source image contains multiple faces, the largest one is used to compare against the target image.</li>
				<li>The target image can contain up to 15 faces. The detected face in the source image is compared against each of the faces detected in the target image.<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">Click on the Face comparison link in the left toolbar to navigate to the Face comparison page.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With the face comparison feature, there are two sections with images, side by side. You can choose to compare images in the left section with images in the right section. To create a Facial Analysis of a sample image, you can do the following: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> panel on the Left-hand side.</li>
				<li>Enter the following URL of an image to analyze: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524788038240-5fa05b5ee256?w=800.</a></li>
				<li>Choose the <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> panel on the right side.</li>
				<li>Enter the following URL of an image to analyze: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524290266577-e90173d9072a?w=800</a>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer265"><img alt="Figure 6.39: First sample images provided for the Face comparison.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0372.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.40: First sample images provided for the Face comparison.</h6></li>
				<li>With the default selections, you can see in the Results section that it identifies the girl in the left image on the right side with a <strong class="bold">97%</strong> degree of confidence:</li>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Activity 1: Creating and Analyzing Different Faces in Rekognition</h3>
			<p>In this activity, you can try out Rekognition with your own images. For example, we have provided links to two sets of images that display the same people. You can enter the sets of images into the left (comparison) and right (comparison) sides by using the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text boxes. Remember, there are two this time, so there are two <strong class="bold">Go</strong> buttons to press as well. The links for these images are<a href=""> https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484691065994-f1b2f364d7a6?w=800</a> and <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1485463598028-44d6c47bf23f?w=800</a>. To ensure that you do this correctly, you will need to navigate to Amazon Rekognition services: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Upload the first set of images to Rekognition so that it can recognize the faces.</li>
				<li>Compare the first set of images with the following parameters:<ul><li>Degree of confidence</li><li>Comparing with different angles</li><li>Lighting</li><li>Position of glasses on the face</li></ul></li>
				<li>Upload the second set of mages to Rekognition.</li>
				<li>Compare the second set of images for face similarity. </li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Text in Images</h3>
			<p>Text in image is a feature of Amazon Rekognition that allows you to detect and recognize text such as <strong class="keyword">street names</strong>, <strong class="keyword">captions</strong>, <strong class="keyword">product names</strong>, and <strong class="keyword">vehicular license plates</strong> in an image. This feature is specifically built to work with real-world images rather than document images.</p>
			<p>For each image provided, the service returns a text label and bounding box, along with a confidence score. This can be extremely useful for searching text across a collection of images. Each image can be tagged with the corresponding text metadata based on the results from this and other capabilities of the service.</p>
			<p>For now, text supported is Latin scripts and numbers (Western script). Up to 50 sequences of characters can be recognized per image. The text must be horizontal with <strong class="bold">+/- </strong>90 degrees rotation.</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">Click on the Text in image link in the left toolbar to navigate to the Text in image page.</p>
			<p>To identify a Text in Image of a sample image, you can do the following: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Text box</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> panel on the Left side.</li>
				<li>Enter the following URL of an image to analyze: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1527174744973-fc9ce02c141d?w=800</a> and you will see the following image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer267"><img alt="Figure 6.41: First sample image provided for the Text in images.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0392.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.42: First sample image provided for the Text in images.</h6></li>
				<li>Rekognition surrounds detected text with borders so you can identify which text regions it has recognized. You can see the results of text extraction in the Results section:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer268"><img alt="Figure 6.42: Results for first sample image provided for the Text in images.&#13;&#10;" src="image/Image57312.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.43: Results for first sample image provided for the Text in images.</h6></li>
				<li>You can see that Rekognition has extracted text from the image with separators | between words in separate regions.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Exercise 25: Extracting Text from your Own Images</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, you will extract text from your own images. We have provided three royalty-free images for you to use:</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">Click on the Text in image link in the left toolbar to navigate to the Text in image page.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Copy and paste or type the URL into the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text box under the <strong class="bold">Use your own image</strong> section at the bottom of the page: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521431974017-2521d1cdcd65?w=800</a> and you will see the following image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer269"><img alt="Figure 6.43: First image provided for Text in images&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0412.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.44: First image provided for Text in images</h6></li>
				<li>You can see the bounding boxes around the image, which signifies that Rekognition has recognized the text in the image. The results can be viewed in the Results panel to the right of the image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer270"><img alt="Figure 6.44: Results of the first image provided for Text in images&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0421.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.45: Results of the first image provided for Text in images</h6></li>
				<li>The next image is at the following URL. Copy and paste or type it into the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text box as before: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528481958642-cd4b4efb1ae1?w=800</a> and you will see the following image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer271"><img alt="Figure 6.45: Second image provided for Text in images.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0432.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.46: Second image provided for Text in images.</h6></li>
				<li>You can see that Rekognition has recognized the main text in the window of the shop: <strong class="bold">OCEAN GIFTS SPORTFISHING WHALE WATCHING</strong>.</li>
				<li>However, it has also placed a rectangle around the fuzzy text on the left-hand side of the image. When you view the results, you will see the extra text in the text output:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer272"><img alt="Figure 6.46: Results of the second image provided for Text in images&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0441.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.47: Results of the second image provided for Text in images</h6></li>
				<li>It has recognized <strong class="inline">ac</strong> from the blurry text, and nothing more. This is something you should be aware of and watch out for in your results. It is possible for Rekognition to get confused and return spurious results.</li>
				<li>Finally, copy and paste or type the following URL into the <strong class="bold">Use image URL</strong> text box: <a href="">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1456668609474-b579f17cf693?w=800</a><span class="hidden"> </span>and you will see the following image:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer273"><img alt="Figure 6.47: Third image provided for the Text in images.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0452.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 6.48: Third image provided for the Text in images.</h6></li>
				<li>This is another example of a license plate. However, if you look closely, you might see that the service has placed a bounding box not just around the license plate but also around other text on the upper grille of the car, which it believes it is able to identify. The results are as follows:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer274"><img alt=" Figure 6.48: Results of the third image provided for Text in images.&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0461.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 6.49: Results of the third image provided for Text in images.</h6></li>
				<li>It has identified the text <strong class="bold">e</strong> from the region that it outlined in addition to the license plate text. Once again, this is something to be aware of when relying on the results, and a manual validation process is clearly beneficial in this case.<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">To refer to the detailed steps, go to the <em class="italics">Appendix A</em> at the end of this book on Page no. 232</p></li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Summary</h2>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to use the various features of the Amazon Rekognition service and applied this to images. First, you used the service to recognize objects and scenes in images. Next, you moderated images that might have objectionable content by using Rekognition to recognize the objectionable content in the images.</p>
			<p>You were able to analyze faces with Rekognition and were also able to identify their gender, age range, whether they were smiling, and whether they were wearing glasses.</p>
			<p>You also recognized celebrities and famous people with the service, and compared faces in different images to see whether they were the same. Finally, you were able to extract text that was displayed in images.</p>
			<p>These types of features would have seemed unbelievable just a few years ago. The nature of machine learning and artificial intelligence is that immense strides have been made recently, today, and into the foreseeable future in terms of what computers are going to be able to do — and AWS will be able to provide these services to you and your applications!</p>
