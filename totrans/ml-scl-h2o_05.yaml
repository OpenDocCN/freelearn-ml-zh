- en: This section dives deep into advanced techniques to build accurate and trusted
    ML models with large to massive data volumes using H2O. We first overview the
    full capability set of H2O-3 and Sparkling Water for model building. From there,
    we demonstrate these capabilities by engineering features, building and optimizing
    supervised learning models, building H2O models embedded in Spark pipelines, building
    unsupervised models using H2O algorithms, and reviewing how to update and ensure
    the reproducibility of H2O models. From there, we introduce in depth a number
    of methods for interpreting and understanding the decision-making process of your
    model and introduce auto-documentation within H2O. Finally, we do an extensive
    and thorough exercise in model building from problem statement and raw data through
    data cleaning, feature engineering, model building and optimization, and candidate
    model selection based on performance and explainability.
