- en: Computer vision is found everywhere in modern technology. OpenCV for Python
    enables us to run computer vision algorithms in real time. With the advent of
    powerful machines, we are getting more processing power to work with. Using this
    technology, we can seamlessly integrate our computer vision applications into
    the cloud. Web developers can develop complex applications without having to reinvent
    the wheel. This book is a practical tutorial that covers various examples at different
    levels, teaching you about the different functions of OpenCV and their actual
    implementations.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Applying Geometric Transformations to Images"),
    *Applying Geometric Transformations to Images*, explains how to apply geometric
    transformations to images. In this chapter, we will discuss affine and projective
    transformations, and see how we can use them to apply cool geometric effects to
    photos. The chapter will begin with the procedure to install OpenCV-Python on
    multiple platforms such as Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. We will also learn how
    to manipulate an image in various ways, such as resizing, changing color spaces,
    and so on.'

    *Detecting Edges and Applying Image Filters*, shows how to use fundamental image-processing
    operators and how we can use them to build bigger projects. We will discuss why
    we need edge detection and how it can be used in various different ways in computer
    vision applications. We will discuss image filtering and how we can use it to
    apply various visual effects to photos.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Cartoonizing an Image"), *Cartoonizing an
    Image*, shows how to cartoonize a given image using image filters and other transformations.
    We will see how to use the webcam to capture a live video stream. We will discuss
    how to build a real-time application, where we extract information from each frame
    in the stream and display the result.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Detecting and Tracking Different Body Parts"),
    *Detecting and Tracking Different Body Parts*, shows how to detect and track faces
    in a live video stream. We will discuss the face detection pipeline and see how
    we can use it to detect and track different body parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth,
    nose, and so on.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Extracting Features from an Image"), *Extracting
    Features from an Image*, is about detecting the salient points (called keypoints)
    in an image. We will discuss why these salient points are important and how we
    can use them to understand the image content. We will talk about the different
    techniques that can be used to detect salient points and extract features from
    an image.'

    Panoramic Image*, shows how to create a panoramic image by stitching multiple
    images of the same scene together.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Seam Carving"), *Seam Carving*, shows how
    to do content-aware image resizing. We will discuss how to detect "interesting"
    parts in an image and see how we can resize a given image without deteriorating
    those interesting parts.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Detecting Shapes and Segmenting an Image"),
    *Detecting Shapes and Segmenting an Image*, shows how to perform image segmentation.
    We will discuss how to partition a given image into its constituent parts in the
    best possible way. You will also learn how to separate the foreground from the
    background in an image.'

    you how to track different objects in a live video stream. At the end of this
    chapter, you will be able to track any object in a live video stream that is captured
    through the webcam.'
