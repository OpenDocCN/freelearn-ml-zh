- en: Data science and machine learning in particular are emerging as leading topics
    in the tech commercial environment to evaluate the always increasing amount of
    data generated by the users. This book will explain how to use Python to develop
    a web commercial application using Django and how to employ some specific libraries
    (sklearn, scipy, nltk, Django, and some others) to manipulate and analyze (through
    machine learning techniques) data that is generated or used in the application.
