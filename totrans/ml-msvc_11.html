			<p>In the previous chapters, we discussed building an MSA system and integrating AI algorithms to form an Intelligent MSA. We covered concepts, techniques, and methodologies while accompanying them <span class="No-Break">with examples.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the different <strong class="bold">greenfield</strong> and <strong class="bold">brownfield</strong> deployment considerations, and ways to smoothly deploy the new intelligent MSA system with minimal operational disruptions, to be able to maintain overall system stability and <span class="No-Break">business continuity.</span></p>
			<p>We will also examine how to overcome general deployment challenges, particularly in brownfield deployments where existing systems are in production, and implement a successful and effective migration plan for the new Intelligent <span class="No-Break">MSA system.</span></p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Deployment strategies</span></li>
				<li>Greenfield versus <span class="No-Break">brownfield deployment</span></li>

			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Deployment strategies</h1>
			<p>Organizations utilize various techniques<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> to minimize downtime and ensure a seamless and successful deployment when deploying a new system. Some of the most commonly used deployment strategies organizations follow are Recreate, Ramped, Blue/Green, Canary, A/B Testing, and <span class="No-Break">Shadow deployments:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Recreate deployment</strong> is a simple, straightforward approach<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> that involves replacing<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> the entire infrastructure at once, similar to the Big Bang migration we discussed in <a href="B18934_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>. This approach is best suited for small and simple systems; however, it also means that the system is completely offline during the deployment process, which can lead to <span class="No-Break">significant downtime.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Ramped deployment</strong> is similar to the Trickle migration we discussed<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> in <a href="B18934_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>. The Ramped deployment<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> allows the existing system to remain online during the deployment process. The new system is brought online gradually, and traffic is gradually routed to it, allowing both systems to stay available to users throughout the deployment process. Although this can be effective in small businesses and simple systems, this approach is ideal for larger, more complex systems, where minimizing downtime is <span class="No-Break">a priority.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Blue/Green deployment</strong> is a technique that involves maintaining<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> two identical production<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> environments, referred to as “blue” and “green,” and routing traffic to one or the other. This allows for a seamless switchover in case any operational issues are experienced in the newly deployed version. This method is best suited for mission-critical systems since it ensures that there is always a working system available to users at any <span class="No-Break">given time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Canary deployment</strong> is a technique that involves deploying the new<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> system alongside the existing<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> one and routing a small percentage of traffic to the new system. This allows for testing the new system with actual production traffic before rolling it out completely. If problems arise in the new system, the rollout can be reevaluated based on the type of issues encountered; then, the previous system can be reinstated while the problems are being resolved. This approach is often used to deploy changes to critical systems that require high levels <span class="No-Break">of availability.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">A/B testing deployment</strong> is another approach that involves simultaneously<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> running both the old<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> and the new system but testing them with different subsets of users to determine which performs better. This method works best for testing new system features <span class="No-Break">or services.</span></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Shadow deployment</strong>, the new system is deployed to run alongside<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> the existing system. The live<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> production traffic of the old system is then redirected to the new system to test a newly released feature, the system stability under load, or test the new system altogether. This approach is best used in large systems deployed in <span class="No-Break">large organizations.</span></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 11.1: Comparison of the different deployment strategies</p>
			<p>Each of these strategies has<a id="_idIndexMarker627"/> its pros and cons, and none of them would be best suited for every case. Organizations must choose the appropriate strategy based on their specific needs and the nature of the changes <span class="No-Break">being deployed.</span></p>
			<p>The complexity and design of the existing system that’s being upgraded or replaced, as well as its age and operation and the technology stack being used, play significant roles in determining the deployment strategy. In the next section, we will discuss the greenfield and brownfield deployments and their impact on determining the specifics of the deployment approach <span class="No-Break">and plan.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Greenfield versus brownfield deployment</h1>
			<p>With our intelligent MSA system ready for deployment, we now need to think in detail about the infrastructure we have or need to acquire to deploy the system <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></p>
			<p>Some of the main questions we need to address are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the infrastructure details needed to run the intelligent <span class="No-Break">MSA system?</span></li>
				<li>Do we have the hardware and software resources needed to deploy and run the <span class="No-Break">system efficiently?</span></li>
				<li>Can we leverage our existing infrastructure and applications to deploy the <span class="No-Break">new system?</span></li>
				<li>What is the delta between the infrastructure needed and the infrastructure we have in place, and how can we fill <span class="No-Break">that gap?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The organization’s current infrastructure setup and existing systems (if any) play a crucial role in answering all of the preceding questions – that is, whether the new system is being deployed in a greenfield or <span class="No-Break">brownfield environment.</span></p>
			<p>Greenfield deployment<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> refers to building and deploying a new system or infrastructure from scratch with no previous system or infrastructure in place. Thus, we must build the new system without major constraints, dependencies, integration work, or compatibility issues to consider before building and running the <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<p>On the other hand, a brownfield deployment<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> refers to the process of deploying a new system or infrastructure on a site that is already running with an existing system in place. The site may have existing infrastructure such as servers, applications, network components, and more that may be reused for deploying the <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<p>In short, greenfield deployment is a new start from scratch, whereas brownfield deployment involves building on top of existing systems or infrastructure and possibly dealing with some integration issues, compatibility concerns, and <span class="No-Break">resource constraints.</span></p>
			<p>Whether it is a greenfield<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> or brownfield deployment is often determined by the organization’s<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> situation and how the organization’s business process is being conducted. Nevertheless, it is still important to understand the pros and cons of each deployment type to <span class="No-Break">plan accurately.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If cost saving is a major focus in the organization, we should leverage as many existing components as possible from the existing brownfield infrastructure. However, we need to reuse existing components in a way that cannot negatively impact the deployed system’s efficiency, reliability, <span class="No-Break">or functionality.</span></p>
			<p>The following are some factors to consider when evaluating both <span class="No-Break">deployment types.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Flexibility</h2>
			<p>Because in greenfield deployment<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> we are starting from scratch, this gives us the liberty to design, implement, and optimize the new system for the specific needs of the organization without restricting ourselves to any dependent components or existing <span class="No-Break">production systems.</span></p>
			<p>In brownfield, on the other hand, we must always think of the already running systems and their dependencies before designing or deploying any part of the new system. This in itself can limit the deployment, customization, or optimization of the <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Scalability</h2>
			<p>Greenfield implementations<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> offer higher scalability compared to brownfield because, in greenfield implementations, we deploy new infrastructure without any existing constraints that could limit the design or customization of the <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<p>This lack of constraints gives architects and system designers the choice to design the system so that it scales without thinking of underlying technology or existing equipment that may hinder the system’s capabilities <span class="No-Break">or scale.</span></p>
			<p>The existing infrastructure in the brownfield’s case, however, may have legacy systems that are likely to be reused in part or as a whole whenever possible. Reusing different parts of the legacy systems may impede the new <span class="No-Break">system’s scalability.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, legacy systems usually allocate more physical space and are more power-consuming than modern systems, which adds more limitations to the overall <span class="No-Break">system scalability.</span></p>
			<p>Having said that, as we deploy<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> the new system and gradually refresh the existing infrastructure, we will use up-to-date technologies and modern systems that will free up physical space and reduce power requirements. This, in turn, will help us eventually scale the <span class="No-Break">system better.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Technology stack</h2>
			<p>In a greenfield deployment, we have<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> the liberty to leverage the latest technologies, applications, and tools, which can, among many other things, enhance performance, security, and capability, and prolong the system’s <span class="No-Break">overall lifetime.</span></p>
			<p>With the legacy systems in brownfield environments, older technology, hardware, tools, and systems are used, which can introduce limitations on the system’s supportability, capabilities, scalability, and future expansions <span class="No-Break">and integration.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Integration</h2>
			<p>As explained in other aspects <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>of the comparison, in greenfield environments, all the components of the system are new and are designed and built from the beginning to work together seamlessly. Integration, therefore, is not an issue <span class="No-Break">at all.</span></p>
			<p>Integrating a new system with an existing IT infrastructure in the case of a brownfield deployment, however, can be challenging, as the two systems may not be fully compatible. Integration efforts may be needed for old and new components to work together, and even then, the new mixed system may later provide operational challenges that can cause unforeseen <span class="No-Break">system mishaps.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Cost</h2>
			<p>From an acquisition and CAPEX<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> perspective, building a new system from scratch is higher in cost than building the system from a mix of reused and newly <span class="No-Break">acquired components.</span></p>
			<p>To set up the new system, a certain level of expertise is required that may not be available in-house. The effort and expertise needed to bring the system up and running will certainly have associated costs. However, it could be argued that this cost can be easily offset by the efforts and expertise needed to integrate the new and old components. Possibly different effort and different expertise, but <span class="No-Break">similar cost.</span></p>
			<p>When it comes to OPEX, in a greenfield deployment, we need to consider training costs for the new technologies and systems deployed, as well as potential operational mistakes that can be caused due to the lack of new system hands-on experience. In brownfield deployments, these training costs are <span class="No-Break">usually lower.</span></p>
			<p>Power consumption is typically lower in greenfield deployments, as new systems and technologies are often geared toward power <span class="No-Break">usage optimization.</span></p>
			<p>Another important OPEX consideration is the potential <strong class="bold">technical debt</strong> in brownfield implementations. Technical debt<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> is the shortcuts the organization takes to get the system up and running. In other words, this involves taking a band-aid approach to resolving an integration or operational issue during the deployment, and achieving short-term results that can be catastrophic in the <span class="No-Break">long term.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Time-to-market</h2>
			<p>Time-to-market is an interesting<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> aspect of the deployment and can go both ways. Generally speaking, deploying a system in a greenfield environment takes longer than integrating with an already existing functioning system, as is the case in a brownfield environment. But that would be highly dependent on how complex an existing system <span class="No-Break">may be.</span></p>
			<p>If we are deploying our new system on top of a significantly old or complex disorganized infrastructure, we could argue that deploying a new system fresh from scratch is much more straightforward and a time saver than trying to get both systems <span class="No-Break">integrated successfully.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Risks</h2>
			<p>This is another aspect<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> of the deployment that can be debated <span class="No-Break">either way.</span></p>
			<p>With a lack of experience with the new infrastructure, new technologies, new systems, new tools, and new applications, system operational mishaps are more likely, and the time to resolution could be higher. In contrast, with no backup system in place, there will be no fallback option if the new system does not perform <span class="No-Break">as expected.</span></p>
			<p>But again, if the old system in the brownfield environment is too complex or disorganized, the risks would be higher in a brownfield deployment due to complexities in integration, potential technical debt, old unsupported components, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Staff onboarding</h2>
			<p>Companies that are already<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> using an existing system have a better understanding of how it works and insights into its operations and potential issues, which can make the deployment process and system <span class="No-Break">operations smoother.</span></p>
			<p>In greenfield deployments, training and accumulated experience are needed before staff can start to become familiar with the <span class="No-Break">system details.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>User adoption</h2>
			<p>User adoption of the new system<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> may require adapting to new ways of performing day-to-day tasks, a shift in internal and potentially external business operations, and how the organization deals with internal and external customers. This shift may require a change in organizational culture, which can pose a significant challenge to the successful implementation of the system and reveal operational shortcomings <span class="No-Break">after deployment.</span></p>
			<p>In a brownfield environment, the updated system capabilities could be incremental or somewhat transparent to the user, which makes user adoption much easier and faster compared to deploying a completely new system, as in the case of a greenfield deployment. A successful and gradual user adoption helps uncover potential design, implementation, and operational deficiencies that can be quickly addressed <span class="No-Break">and fixed.</span></p>
			<p>In either case, user training is needed, but certainly, in a greenfield, training is more complex and involved<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> over the <span class="No-Break">brownfield case.</span></p>
			<p>The following table summarizes the comparison between greenfield and brownfield aspects<a id="_idIndexMarker644"/> of <span class="No-Break">the deployment:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 11.2: Greenfield versus brownfield</p>
			<p>In this section, we discussed the main differences between greenfield and brownfield deployments, the pros and cons of each environment, what to consider, <span class="No-Break">and why.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we will go over how we can overcome deployment challenges in both environments and the deployment best practices in <span class="No-Break">each case.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Overcoming deployment challenges</h1>
			<p>We now understand the different aspects<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> of system deployment in greenfield and brownfield environments, as well as the several challenges that can be presented during the system design and implementation. In this section, we will cover some of the concepts, strategies, and approaches for mitigating these challenges to ensure a smooth and successful <span class="No-Break">system deployment.</span></p>
			<p>We should begin our deployment project with a solid project team that possesses diverse skills and experiences in technical areas of the project, deployment and project management, and <span class="No-Break">vendor management.</span></p>
			<p>In the absence of in-house<a id="_idIndexMarker646"/> experience, outsourcing one or more project experience areas through third parties may be necessary. Partners may include system integrators, and/or equipment vendors, and <span class="No-Break">value-added resellers.</span></p>
			<p>This experienced team will help conduct thorough planning and research to be able to understand the specific needs of the organization, potential risks, local regulations, and any necessary <span class="No-Break">compliance needs.</span></p>
			<p>Compliance with industry and local regulations is an essential part of the project. Aside from the technical aspects and technologies of the project, a system processing credit cards, for example, will<a id="_idIndexMarker647"/> require team members who are experienced in PCI compliance and rules. A healthcare system deployed<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> in the United States, for example, may need members who have experience with HIPAA compliance needs, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<p>Project management is key to establishing clear team communication and collaboration. The project managers help track the project process, changes, and requirements, and ensure that the timelines and goals are met throughout the project cycles. The project managers also make certain that all stakeholders are properly informed and engaged throughout the different phases of <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></p>
			<p>The type of project management style or approach is dependent on the organization itself, the timeline, and the implementation details and technologies deployed. Whether it is waterfall, agile, scrum, or something else, the project manager must decide with <span class="No-Break">the team.</span></p>
			<p>Addressing deployment challenges is a task that is pursued within the project cycle. Our focus here is on this aspect of the project cycle, particularly concerning greenfield and <span class="No-Break">brownfield deployments.</span></p>
			<p>Before any deployment activities, complete visibility of the deployment risks is necessary. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a clear deployment risk plan to be able to identify the risks and mitigate each risk to ensure a <span class="No-Break">successful deployment.</span></p>
			<p>The following chart illustrates the risk management process for our deployment cycle. The process should start with identifying the risks, determining ways to avoid or minimize them, developing a mitigation plan, and continually testing, monitoring, and reviewing the deployment to update the mitigation plan for any new risks or challenges that arise <span class="No-Break">during</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker649"/></span><span class="No-Break"> implementation:</span></p>

			<p>In the following subsections, we will go over the main activities of a risk management plan and how each phase of the plan is relevant to our <span class="No-Break">deployment activities.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Identify deployment risks</h2>
			<p>To address the deployment<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> challenges, we start by identifying the potential risks we may encounter when deploying our system. In a greenfield environment, the risks we identified<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> earlier are as follows. The <strong class="bold">greenfield risk</strong> is referred to <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">GR</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">GR1</strong>: <span class="No-Break">High CAPEX</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GR2</strong>: <span class="No-Break">Deployment time</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GR3</strong>: System failures due to lack of training and <span class="No-Break">experienced staff</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GR4</strong>: Slow or lack of <span class="No-Break">user adoption</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a brownfield environment, the risks<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> we identified earlier are as follows. The <strong class="bold">brownfield risk</strong> is referred to <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">BR</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">BR1</strong>: System capabilities limitation due to potentially low flexibility and scalability, and some reused <span class="No-Break">legacy technologies</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BR2</strong>: <span class="No-Break">High OPEX</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have identified the potential risks, it’s time to prioritize them based on their likelihood and potential impact on the project. This will<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> help us calculate the <strong class="bold">risk exposure</strong> and plan and allocate proper<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> <span class="No-Break">resources effectively.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Prioritize risks</h2>
			<p>Risk exposure<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> is the risk probability<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> multiplied by the impact of that risk on the deployment project. The higher the risk exposure, the higher the priority of working on mitigating that risk <span class="No-Break">should be.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 11</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> shows a color-coded risk exposure matrix for the previously identified risks. Please note that the level of risk exposure can greatly vary between organizations based on various factors, such as project complexity and organizational needs, the stability and complexity of the existing system, project requirements, budget, timeline, <span class="No-Break">and more:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer185" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18934_11_2.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2: Risk exposure matrix"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.2: Risk exposure matrix</p>
			<p>We always prioritize from the top right to the bottom left of the risk mitigation chart. The red zone, where the risk and the likelihood are Medium to High, is where we need to start allocating resources. This is followed by the yellow zone, then the <span class="No-Break">green zone.</span></p>
			<p>So, we should start with greenfield risk #1 (GR1), how to mitigate high CAPEX risks, then GR3, where we lack experienced staff to deploy the new system, then GR2, where the new system deployment time may be an issue, and then conclude the mitigation of greenfield risks by addressing GR4, where we may face a slow user adoption of the <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<p>For brownfield risk mitigation, we start with brownfield risk #1 (BR1) since it has a higher exposure in the red zone of the matrix, then <span class="No-Break">do BR2.</span></p>
			<p>Risks are not always avoidable. Risks often aren’t. In cases where risk elimination is not possible, the mitigation plan has to address how we can at least minimize the risks to a <span class="No-Break">manageable level.</span></p>
			<p>Many organizations choose to ignore risks<a id="_idIndexMarker657"/> with low/very low likelihood and low/very low impact. The process of mitigating risks in this particular case may very well be costly and riskier than the <span class="No-Break">risk itself.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Developing and implementing a risk mitigation plan</h2>
			<p>We need to develop a mitigation plan<a id="_idIndexMarker658"/> to manage the identified<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> risks. This plan should include specific actions that will be taken to mitigate or eliminate the risks, resources involved, and contingencies in case the risks <span class="No-Break">do occur.</span></p>
			<p>We also need to identify our risk mitigation strategies based on the calculated exposure of each risk. As we will see in the next few subsections, these strategies can include implementing operational safeguards, extra measures using additional system components, testing the system before deployment, training both system users and administrators to ensure they can effectively use the new system, and developing a rollback plan in case of any unexpected <span class="No-Break">deployment issues.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s apply all these to our deployment project’s <span class="No-Break">identified risks.</span></p>
			<h3>GR1 – high CAPEX risk</h3>
			<p>When addressing<a id="_idIndexMarker660"/> the high CAPEX risk, we need to focus on a few things – first, the project budget, second, the system and project requirements, and third, how to use effective negotiation skills to acquire the necessary infrastructure that would successfully fulfill all of the desired <span class="No-Break">system requirements.</span></p>
			<p>Sometimes, of course, budget and time constraints become a barrier to acquiring all of the requirements’ wish list items. Therefore, it is important to prioritize your requirements, especially if you have strong <span class="No-Break">budget constraints.</span></p>
			<p>The objective is to acquire the infrastructure that would get us all of our wish list requirements; however, at some point, we may need to give up some of the nice-to-have features of the system for the sake of meeting our budget. This is where our negotiation skills become vital. The stronger our negotiation skills, the greater the likelihood of successfully deploying the new system and meeting all the requirements <span class="No-Break">within budget.</span></p>
			<p>It is useful to go over a few important negotiation techniques that can help us achieve <span class="No-Break">our objective.</span></p>
			<p>Start by conducting thorough research on all vendors that can be involved in providing the infrastructure assets. This includes the technical and business strengths and weaknesses of each potential vendor, their list prices, the quality level of their deployment and operational support, their product roadmap, and their future <span class="No-Break">business outlook.</span></p>
			<p>Then, we can come up with multiple options from our vendor research. Having multiple options gives us more flexibility and bargaining power during our vendor <span class="No-Break">negotiation phase.</span></p>
			<p>Out of all the available options, having a clear <strong class="bold">Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">BATNA</strong>) is critical. BATNA means having the most favorable<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> option we can achieve if the negotiations fail and no agreement is reached with the infrastructure vendors. It is the fallback option that we can rely on if the negotiations do not go as we initially planned with a <span class="No-Break">specific vendor.</span></p>
			<p>Having a clear and well-defined BATNA is important in displaying strong bargaining power during the negotiation process. A BATNA gives the vendors a sense of how much they can miss out if they do not close the infrastructure <span class="No-Break">acquisition deal.</span></p>
			<p>BATNA also helps us understand when it’s time to walk away from the negotiations if the vendors are not willing to meet our infrastructure needs with the available budget. It is about the alternatives that are available to us and the consequences of choosing or not choosing a <span class="No-Break">specific vendor.</span></p>
			<p>Larger and highly reputable<a id="_idIndexMarker662"/> organizations can use leverage. Leverage is the ability to use your reputation, market position, or market size to influence the outcome of the negotiation. Leverage can be very effective in striking a good deal with vendors. Vendors generally strive to gain a foothold in large organizations to create a customer reference or as a way to build more business out of that <span class="No-Break">particular deal.</span></p>
			<p>Having said all that, it is essential to show a certain level of flexibility during the negotiation. Flexibility will demonstrate our willingness to compromise and is likely to lead to a strong long-term and healthy business relationship with <span class="No-Break">the vendors:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18934_11_3.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3: Negotiation strategies"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3: Negotiation strategies</p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 11</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> sums up the negotiation strategies<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> you could follow to minimize budget overrun risks due to infrastructure cost and the overall <span class="No-Break">project CAPEX.</span></p>
			<p>Another effective way of mitigating CAPEX risks is to use a cloud provider in deploying your new infrastructure, especially during the initial testing and adjustment phases of <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></p>
			<p>Using containerization and virtualization to build new workloads is another way to help reduce CAPEX risks. However, by doing so, we may introduce some OPEX and other types of deployment risks, especially if the staff is not trained enough on cloud <span class="No-Break">environment</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker664"/></span><span class="No-Break"> deployments.</span></p>
			<h3>GR2 – deployment time risks</h3>
			<p>When deploying<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> a new project, especially a project that involves new technologies, techniques, and concepts, the potential of running behind schedule cannot be ignored. There is always a learning curve associated with the overall <span class="No-Break">project cycle.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, potential frequent changes and scope creeps are also important to account for. This emphasizes the importance of engaging a skilled team from the start <span class="No-Break">even more.</span></p>
			<p>A highly skilled and well-trained project team will help minimize scope creep and time delay risks. In the absence of in-house subject matter experts, hiring an external party as a system integrator and building an adequate training plan for the team become critical when managing time <span class="No-Break">delay risks.</span></p>
			<p>There may be factors other than team skills that can contribute to project timeline and scope creep risks. As part of our risk mitigation plan, we need to account for all of these factors and make sure they are controlled to consequently control their <span class="No-Break">associated risks.</span></p>
			<p>MSA systems can be very complex and burdensome to deploy. The more complex the system is, the more difficult it can be to predict and manage the <span class="No-Break">deployment timeline.</span></p>
			<p>In brownfields, the deployment of the new system often depends on the availability and operational stability of the already existing systems. Furthermore, integrating the new system with the existing systems can add another level of complexity and time-consuming tasks, all of which can potentially prolong the overall <span class="No-Break">deployment timeline.</span></p>
			<p>One way to mitigate the effect of complexity on the overall risk is to avoid forklift and big bang changes. Rather, use a trickle approach by breaking down the deployment into multiple simple phases and stages. Follow the famous Einstein rule, “<em class="italic">Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</em>” Simplify as much as possible, but not in a way to compromise the system’s functionality <span class="No-Break">or reliability.</span></p>
			<p>Although thorough testing is necessary to ensure the new system’s reliability and adherence to the organization’s needs, over-analyzing and over-testing often happen in complex projects. This process can significantly delay the <span class="No-Break">system deployment.</span></p>
			<p>One way to address the testing delays factor is to consider running the system in production in a <strong class="bold">Limited Availability</strong> (<strong class="bold">LA</strong>) fashion, a beta version, or a pre-launch period of some sort. This LA approach<a id="_idIndexMarker666"/> will help us apply real user traffic to the system while we focus on monitoring<a id="_idIndexMarker667"/> and making system changes as needed before we transition the system into <span class="No-Break">full-scale production.</span></p>
			<h3>GR3 and GR4 – system failure risks and user adoption risks</h3>
			<p>User adoption<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> can highly depend on any new <strong class="bold">user interface/user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI/UX</strong>) changes or added complexities. Assuming<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> a well-designed<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> system’s UI/UX, system failure and slow user adoption risks are also dependent on the experience of the project and operation teams, and how familiar the users are with working on <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>To normalize the experience and user familiarity risks, it’s important to first include a solid UI/UX design team from the outset of the project, then adopt a top-down approach by securing a strong buy-in from project sponsors <span class="No-Break">and executives.</span></p>
			<p>The top-down approach will help adopt the organization’s processes and changes necessary to create a cultural shift in conducting the business using the new system. The buy-in can also help enforce a training program for both system users and the project team. This training can significantly help in bridging the gaps between the existing experience of the project team and the <span class="No-Break">experience needed.</span></p>
			<h3>BR1 – system capability limitations</h3>
			<p>Because we are deploying<a id="_idIndexMarker671"/> the new system with some older components being used in the existing system, we are likely to run into integration incompatibilities, limitations in the older hardware and software features, and limitations in scaling in terms of traffic, data loads, <span class="No-Break">or storage.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, a system with legacy components may become outdated sooner than anticipated. This can result in obsolete software and hardware components that are no longer usable or valuable, or in vendor out-of-support announcements, which would shorten the life span of the <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<p>When system components are out of support, vendors can no longer provide part replacements or software updates, or even assist in case any operational issues arise on the out-of-support components. This can severely impact the system’s reliability and jeopardize the organization’s <span class="No-Break">business continuity.</span></p>
			<p>To mitigate the risk of system<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> capability limitations, we must have clear visibility and understanding of the vendor product map for each reused legacy system component and clear visibility of the component’s dependencies. This understanding shall help us assess the impact of that component on the scalability levels, and future operational reliability and stability of the system <span class="No-Break">being deployed.</span></p>
			<h3>BR2 – high OPEX</h3>
			<p>As we have previously explained, integrating <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>both new and older systems can introduce many deployment and operational challenges that can make the system much more complex, and introduce technical debt, high maintenance costs, and high operational costs to keep the system <span class="No-Break">running smoothly.</span></p>
			<p>Security is also a major concern in brownfield deployments. Technical debt, along with mixing older and new components, may introduce vulnerabilities that were not present in the existing infrastructure, which can lead to costly data corruption, data loss, data recovery, security breaches, and irreversible <span class="No-Break">reputational damage.</span></p>
			<p>To mitigate these risks, organizations should thoroughly evaluate the impact and have a clear cost-benefit analysis of each reusable component of the existing system before proceeding with <span class="No-Break">the deployment.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, having a robust disaster recovery and backup plan in place in case of data loss or corruption is key to mitigating some <span class="No-Break">OPEX risks.</span></p>
			<p>All the preceding risk examples and their mitigation strategies should be thoroughly discussed as part of the developed risk mitigation plan, with step-by-step guides <span class="No-Break">and documentation.</span></p>
			<p>Should any of these risks take place, especially in the case of brownfields, where an existing system may already be running, a comprehensive rollback plan should be executed immediately. The rollback plan is the next step in how to overcome the deployment challenges. The following subsection takes us through what a rollback plan is and what <span class="No-Break">it entails.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>The rollback plan</h2>
			<p>Remember<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> Murphy’s Law, which states “<em class="italic">Anything that can go wrong will </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">go wrong</em></span><span class="No-Break">”?</span></p>
			<p>How often do we create a solid and well-crafted implementation or migration plan, expecting a smooth change in the system, but then experience unexpected and bizarre behavior during the execution of <span class="No-Break">the plan?</span></p>
			<p>A rule of thumb here is that anything can go wrong during the deployment. We put enough planning and precautions for nothing to go wrong, but unfortunately, things do not always work in our favor. We may still overlook things, system bugs may get triggered, equipment mishaps may happen, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, developing a rollback plan is necessary to be able to maintain business continuity. We should have the plan built in a way that it includes clear steps and procedures to move back to the initial system state before the change and resume normal <span class="No-Break">operations quickly.</span></p>
			<p>Adopting a phased deployment approach, as previously discussed, helps to quickly roll back only a portion of the change, which helps us avoid wasting resources, valuable change window time, and efforts invested during the deployment, and in developing the <span class="No-Break">deployment plan.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Test, monitor, and adjust</h2>
			<p>The next step in overcoming<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> deployment challenges<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> is to test and validate<a id="_idIndexMarker677"/> the system’s requirements and functionality to ensure it meets the performance, functional, and <span class="No-Break">operational requirements.</span></p>
			<p>The project teams, when under time pressures, often deprioritize system security over system functionality. Data security and data protection, when overlooked, can severely impact the project’s overall deployment and reliability, especially with systems that handle critical user data and have to comply with certain regulations and compliance acts, as in the case of PCI <span class="No-Break">or HIPAA.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, the test plan has to have a specific section dedicated to system security and compliance testing. Hiring a specialized firm in the area of security and compliance helps minimize the risk of data breaches or other <span class="No-Break">security incidents.</span></p>
			<p>As we gradually apply test and production load to the system, the test plan should be able to ensure the systems being deployed are scalable and flexible enough to adapt to changing needs and requirements. This is a critical aspect of the test plan during a brownfield deployment since the integration with the existing system may hinder the overall <span class="No-Break">system’s capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>Then, we need to continuously and carefully monitor and review the identified risks throughout the project to ensure that the risk mitigation plan is effective and that any new risks are identified and <span class="No-Break">addressed promptly.</span></p>
			<p>Any newly identified risks<a id="_idIndexMarker678"/> will have to be included<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> in the mitigation<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> plan through the project change management process. The newly identified risks and mitigation strategies will need to be communicated to all stakeholders, including the project team, the organization’s management, and the <span class="No-Break">system users.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Post-deployment and pre-production review</h2>
			<p>Once the deployment<a id="_idIndexMarker681"/> is over, the system is operational, tested, and running<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> in a pre-production or LA manner. Just before closing the deployment project, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of our risk management plan, identify any areas for improvement, and document the outcome of our findings. The outcome can then be integrated into the same project deployment effort or conclude the existing deployment and initiate a new project for <span class="No-Break">that matter.</span></p>
			<p>The post-deployment assessment will ensure the new system’s continued stability, performance, <span class="No-Break">and reliability.</span></p>
			<p>In brownfields, we may end up running in a bi-modal approach, where both systems are running at the same time and serving users at the same time but in different ways and at different levels. In this case, we need to consider building specific roles and responsibilities matrices for each system. This helps<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> streamline operations<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> and increase the <span class="No-Break">system’s supportability.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered greenfield and brownfield deployments, the difference between each, their pros and cons, risk details during the deployment process in general, and the specifics of each risk in each <span class="No-Break">deployment case.</span></p>
			<p>We also provided examples of the risks associated with greenfield and brownfield deployments, along with the strategies to mitigate these risks, to gain a better understanding of the challenges involved in successfully deploying a <span class="No-Break">new system.</span></p>
			<p>The topics that were discussed in this chapter act as introductions to what we will be learning in the following chapter. In the next chapter, we will apply some of what we have learned in this chapter and discuss ways to test, monitor, and update our new ABC-Intelligent <span class="No-Break">MSA system.</span></p>
