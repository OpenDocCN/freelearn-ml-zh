- en: More than six years ago, before I first discovered Kaggle, I was searching for
    a new path in my professional career. A few years later, I was firmly entrenched
    in a new job, which Kaggle helped me find. Before discovering this marvelous site,
    I was looking around on different sites, reading articles, downloading and analyzing
    datasets, trying out pieces of code from GitHub or other sites, doing online trainings,
    and reading books. With Kaggle, I found more than a source of information; I found
    a community sharing the same interest in machine learning, and, more generally,
    in data science, looking to learn, share knowledge, and solve difficult challenges.
    I also discovered that in this community, if you want, you can experience an accelerated
    learning curve, because you can learn from the best, sometimes competing against
    them, and other times collaborating with them. You can also learn from the less
    experienced; after all these years on the platform, I am still learning from both
    crowds.

- en: This mix of continuous challenges and fruitful collaboration makes Kaggle a
    unique platform, where new and old contributors can feel equally welcome and find
    things to learn or share. In my first months on the platform, I mostly learned
    from the vast collections of datasets and notebooks, analyzing competition data
    and offering solutions for active or past competitions and on the discussion threads.
    I soon started to contribute, mostly to notebooks, and discovered how rewarding
    it is to share your own findings and get feedback from other people on the platform.
    This book is about sharing this joy and what I learned while sharing my findings,
    ideas, and solutions with the community.

    a focus on how you can use Kaggle Notebooks resources to help you achieve mastery
    in this field. We will cover simple concepts to more advanced ones. The book is
    also a personal journey and will take you down a similar path to the one I took
    while experimenting and learning about analyzing datasets and preparing for competitions.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Introducing Kaggle and Its Basic Functions*, is a quick introduction
    to Kaggle and its main features, including competitions, datasets, code (formerly
    known as kernels or notebooks), discussions and additional resources, models,
    and learning.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Getting Ready for Your Kaggle Environment*, contains more details
    about the code features on Kaggle, with information about computing environments,
    how to use the online editor, how to fork and modify an existing example, and
    how to use the source control facilities on Kaggle to either save or run a new
    notebook.'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Starting Our Travel – Surviving the Titanic Disaster*, introduces
    a simple dataset that will help you to build a foundation for the skills that
    we will further develop in the book. Most Kagglers will start their journey on
    the platform with this competition. We introduce some tools for data analysis
    in Python (pandas and NumPy), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly),
    and suggestions on how to create the visual identity of your notebook. We will
    perform univariate and bivariate analysis of the features, analyze missing data,
    and generate new features with various techniques. You will also receive your
    first look into deep diving into data and using analysis combined with model baselining
    and iterative improvement to go from exploration to preparation when building
    a model.'

- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Take a Break and Have a Beer or Coffee in London*, combines multiple
    tabular and map datasets to explore geographical data. We start with two datasets:
    the first dataset contains the spatial distribution of pubs in the United Kingdom
    (*Every Pub in England*), and the second contains the distribution of Starbucks
    coffee shops across the world (*Starbucks Locations Worldwide*).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start by analyzing them separately, investigating missing data and understanding
    how we can fill in missing data by using alternative data sources. Then we analyze
    the datasets together and focus on one small region, i.e., London, where we superpose
    the data. We will also discuss aligning data with different spatial resolutions.
    More insights into style, presentation organization, and storytelling will be
    provided.

- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Get Back to Work and Optimize Microloans for Developing Countries*,
    goes one step further and starts analyzing data from a Kaggle analytics competition,
    *Data Science for Good: Kiva Crowdfunding*. Here, we combine multiple loan history,
    demographics, country development, and map datasets to create a story about how
    to improve the allocation of microloans in developing countries. One of the focuses
    of this chapter will be on creating a unified and personal presentation style,
    including a color scheme, section decorations, and graphics style. Another focus
    will be on creating a coherent story about and based on the data that supports
    the thesis of the notebook. We end the chapter with a quick investigation into
    an alternative data analytics competition dataset, *Meta Kaggle*, where we disprove
    a hypothesis about a perceived trend in the community.'

    a dataset of images. The dataset used for this analysis is *The BeeImage Dataset:
    Annotated Honeybee Images*. We combine techniques for image analysis with techniques
    for the analysis and visualization of tabular data to create a rich and insightful
    analysis and prepare for building a machine learning pipeline for multiclass image
    classification. You will learn how to input and display sets of images, how to
    analyze the images, metadata, how to perform image augmentation, and how to work
    with different resizing options. We will also show how to start with a baseline
    model and then, based on the training and validation error analysis, iteratively
    refine the model.'

    in Toxicity Classification`, a dataset from a text classification competition.
    The data is from online postings and, before we use it to build a model, we will
    need to perform data quality assessment and data cleaning for text data. We will
    then explore the data, analyze the frequency of words and vocabulary peculiarities,
    get a few insights into syntactic and semantic analysis, perform sentiment analysis
    and topic modeling, and start the preparation for training a model. We will check
    the coverage of the vocabulary available with our tokenization or embedding solution
    for the corpus in our dataset and apply data processing to improve this vocabulary
    coverage.'

    analysis to reveal the hidden patterns in the signals, we will learn how to generate
    features using the fast Fourier transform, Hilbert transform, and other transformations
    for this time-series model. Then we will learn how to generate several features
    using the various signal processing functions. Readers will learn the basics about
    analyzing signal data, as well as how to generate features using various signal
    processing transformations to build a model.

    perform image and video analysis on *Deepfake Detection Challenge*, a large video
    dataset from a famous Kaggle competition. Analysis will start with training and
    data exploration, and readers will learn how to manipulate the `.mp4` format,
    extract images from video, check video metadata information, perform pre-processing
    of extracted images, and find objects, including body, upper body, face, eyes,
    or mouth, in the images using either computer vision techniques or pre-trained
    models. Finally, we will prepare to build a model to come up with a solution for
    this deep fake detection competition.'

- en: The chapters contain both theory and code. If you want to run the code in the
    book, the easiest way is to follow the links on the `README.md` introduction page
    in the GitHub project for each notebook, fork the notebook, and run it on Kaggle.
    The Kaggle environment is pre-installed with all the needed Python libraries.
    Alternatively, you can download the notebooks from the GitHub project, upload
    them on Kaggle, attach the dataset resources mentioned in the book for each specific
    example, and run them. Another alternative is to download the datasets on Kaggle,
    install your own local environment, and run the notebooks there. In this case,
    however, you will need more advanced knowledge about how to set up a `conda` environment
    locally and install Python libraries using `pip install` or `conda install`.
