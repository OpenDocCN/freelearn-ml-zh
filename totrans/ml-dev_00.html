<p class="NormalPACKT">Machine learning is one of the star disciplines at present. Acclaimed by the media as the future of work, it is said to be part of any significant tech investment in recent months, in a world where everything is driven by data and automation. It is used extensively across many fields such as image understanding, robotics, search engines, self-driving cars, and so on and the number of areas of application increases almost daily. In this book we will study the motivations and current techniques of machine learning using code and diagrams as the main conceptual vehicles, omitting outside the fundamental mathematical results.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">We will start talking about the fundamental machine learning concepts, its branches, and types of problems. Then, there will be an explanatory chapter about the fundamental mathematical concepts required to grasp upcoming techniques. As we advance through the chapters, models of increasing complexity and sophistication are explained, starting with linear regression, then logistic regression, neural networks and its more recent variants (CNNs, RNNs),concluding with a synthetic introduction to more advanced machine learning techniques, such as GANs and reinforcement learning.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is aimed at developers looking to finally grasp what that machine learning hype is all about, and understand the main fundamental concepts, using an algorithmic point of view, along with more formal mathematical definitions.This book implements code concepts in Python, considering the simplicity of its interface, and the fact that Python offers an unmatched set of tools to continue learning from the bookâ€™s code. So, familiarity with Python programming would certainly be helpful for playing around with the code, but it should be manageable from programmers experienced in other languages.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">You will learn how to make informed decisions about the types of algorithms you need to solve your own machine learning problems, and a knowledge of how those algorithms work to get the best possible results. If you want to understand machine learning in day-to-day, coder-friendly language, and have just the right amount of information to be able to do the jump into the discipline, this book will definitely come to your rescue!</p>

<p><a href="593cd323-e00f-4c46-a2e6-31ef4082a6b9.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction - Machine Learning and Statistical Science</em>, covers various introductory concepts in machine learning. It talks about the history, branches and general discipline concepts. It also gives an introduction to the base mathematical concepts needed to understand most of the techniques developed afterward.</p>
<p><a href="fa27740b-e9e0-4ad1-ab13-dfe57b30a956.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>The Learning Process</em>, covers all the steps in the workflow of a machine learning process and shows useful tools and concept definitions for all those stages.</p>
<p><a href="21561940-8885-4d5b-93cd-261462697016.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Clustering</em>, covers several techniques for unsupervised learning, specially K-Means, and K-NN clustering.</p>
<p><a href="e3fded83-005d-4579-964e-4ee46fcbe7d6.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Linear and Logistic Regression</em>, covers two pretty different supervised learning algorithms, which go under a similar name: linear regression (which we will use to perform time series predictions), and logistic regression (which we will use for classification purposes).</p>
<p><a href="2e1508e2-ec6e-4830-b751-944cbff3b358.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Neural Networks</em>, covers one of the basic building blocks of modern machine learning Applications, and ends with the practical step-by-step building of a neural network.</p>
<p><a href="6da78316-aca7-42ce-91d6-e267276bcc7b.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Convolutional Neural Networks</em>, covers this powerful variation of neural networks, and ends with a practical tour of the internals of a very well known architecture of CNN, called VGG16, in a practical application.</p>
<p><a href="f4cf7ed7-6f97-4eaf-bc06-0e2dd6fae2da.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Recurrent Neural Networks</em>, covers an overview of the RNN concept and a complete depiction of all the stages of the most used architecture, the LSTM. Finally, a practical exercise in time series prediction is shared.</p>
<p><a href="e3a34090-ee65-4a14-93c5-a165de7201e1.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Recent Models and Developments</em>, covers two upcoming techniques that have engaged huge interest in the field: generative adversarial networks, and the whole reinforcement learning field.</p>
<p><a href="b1b49f10-4db3-4ff2-8c74-f0fe0cdccd8b.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Software Installation and Configuration</em>, It covers the installation of all the necessary software packages, for three operative systems: Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is focused on machine learning concepts and uses as a Python language (version 3) as a computational tool . We have used Python 3 and the Jupyter Notebook to build our workbooks, which you can edit and play with to better understand the concepts. We focus on how to utilize various Python libraries in the best possible way to build real-world applications. In that spirit, we have tried to keep all the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use it in different scenarios.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is for developers/tech enthusiasts who want to understand the basics of machine learning concepts through a computationally-intensive approach. This book should be suited to people who have programmed in any scripting language, but being familiar with Python will be useful to play around with the code. It will also be useful for current data scientists to get back to the basic concepts, and understand them using a novel, hands-on approach.</p>
