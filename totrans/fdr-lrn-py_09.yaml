    large, is sharded into multiple data sources to be dispersed even into different
    machines or instances that are available for training. Within an FL framework,
    trained models from distributed environments are all aggregated. The trained and
    aggregated model then goes to the processes of **ML Operations** (**ML Ops**)
    for performance validation and continuous monitoring with **Model Operations**
    (**Model Ops**).

    from the other data sources. In this case, the FL can elegantly combine the insights
    from the other data sources and nicely coordinate the integration of the other
    forms of intelligence directly created in the distributed environments. This way,
    you can also create the hybrid model of centralized ML and distributed ML as well.

    in terms of AI advancements. The majority of the challenges are related in some
    way to data accessibility. Issues such as data privacy regulations, lack of real
    data, and data transmission costs are all unique and challenging problems that
    we expect to see FL continue to help solve.

    is playing a more and more important role, such as healthcare, financial, edge,
    and IoT domains. The adherence to privacy that FL offers is particularly important
    for the healthcare and financial sectors, while FL can add significant value in
    terms of scalability and learning efficiency to lots of edge AI and IoT scenarios.
    You also learned how to apply FL to distributed learning for big data to reduce
    training time and costs.

    exciting future trends and developments in which FL is expected to play a key
    role in the coming decade.
