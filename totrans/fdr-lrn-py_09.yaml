    and will only become a greater challenge as time goes on. It is a core problem
    in the development of AI in healthcare and we will touch briefly on some of the

- en: There are several ways to conduct distributed learning on big data, such as
    building a specific end-to-end ML stack applied to different types of servers,
    such as parameter servers, or utilizing certain ML schemes on top of big data
    platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. There are also some other platforms, such
    as GraphLab and Pregel. You can use any libraries, and methods such as stochastic
    proximal descent and coordinate descent with low-level utilities for ML.

    but will not be able to assign the data source to different machines to train
    them locally in a distributed way, especially when the training environments are
    dispersed over the Internet. With FL, you can simply aggregate what different
    distributed machines learn just by synchronizing the federation of the models,
    but you do need to develop a well-designed platform to coordinate the continuous
    operation of distributed learning, with proper model repository and versioning
    approaches as well.

- en: In the example in *Figure 9**.21*, the data source, which is typically very
    large, is sharded into multiple data sources to be dispersed even into different
    machines or instances that are available for training. Within an FL framework,
    trained models from distributed environments are all aggregated. The trained and
    aggregated model then goes to the processes of **ML Operations** (**ML Ops**)
    for performance validation and continuous monitoring with **Model Operations**
    (**Model Ops**).

    from the other data sources. In this case, the FL can elegantly combine the insights
    from the other data sources and nicely coordinate the integration of the other
    forms of intelligence directly created in the distributed environments. This way,
    you can also create the hybrid model of centralized ML and distributed ML as well.

- en: In this chapter, we discussed many of the challenges facing different industries
    in terms of AI advancements. The majority of the challenges are related in some
    way to data accessibility. Issues such as data privacy regulations, lack of real
    data, and data transmission costs are all unique and challenging problems that
    we expect to see FL continue to help solve.

- en: In this chapter, you learned about the use cases of the areas in which the FL
    is playing a more and more important role, such as healthcare, financial, edge,
    and IoT domains. The adherence to privacy that FL offers is particularly important
    for the healthcare and financial sectors, while FL can add significant value in
    terms of scalability and learning efficiency to lots of edge AI and IoT scenarios.
    You also learned how to apply FL to distributed learning for big data to reduce
    training time and costs.

    exciting future trends and developments in which FL is expected to play a key
    role in the coming decade.
