- en: This chapter will brief you about how **Software-defined Data Centers** (**SDDC**)
    can span across multiple data centers and into hybrid service providers, independent
    of physical infrastructure with distributed data and applications. Digital transformation
    is changing the mode of business, and the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) plays
    a critical part in this transformation. Business growth is accelerating and exploring
    better ways to bring new products and services to market quickly with a modern
    data center that can provide the agility, security, and scalability required to
    power innovation and growth. We will learn about the core requirements that customers
    are looking for in IoT implementation.

    retail customers as their application and data will be utilized from data center
    to cloud to edge devices. We will also look at the transformation of networking
    for IoT by understanding how to manage/process massive data across edge devices,
    along with VMware Pulse IoT use cases across different verticals.
