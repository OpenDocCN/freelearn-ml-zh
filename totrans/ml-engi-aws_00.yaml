- en: There is a growing need for professionals with experience in working on machine
    learning (ML) engineering requirements as well as those with knowledge of automating
    complex **MLOps** pipelines in the cloud. This book explores a variety of AWS
    services, such as **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service**, **AWS Glue**, **AWS Lambda**,
    **Amazon Redshift**, and **AWS Lake Formation**, which ML practitioners can leverage
    to meet various data engineering and ML engineering requirements in production.

- en: This machine learning book covers the essential concepts as well as step-by-step
    instructions that are designed to help you get a solid understanding of how to
    manage and secure ML workloads in the cloud. As you progress through the chapters,
    you’ll discover how to use several **container** and **serverless** solutions
    when training and deploying **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** deep learning models
    on AWS. You’ll also delve into proven cost optimization techniques as well as
    data privacy and model privacy preservation strategies in detail as you explore
    best practices when using each AWS.
