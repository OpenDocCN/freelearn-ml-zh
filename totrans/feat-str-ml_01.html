			<p>This section concentrates on the significance of a feature store (<em class="italic">why?</em>) in <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) pipelines. We will start with an ML problem and go through the different stages of ML development, such as data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and inference. We will discuss how the availability of features in production affects model performance and start looking into ways in which features are brought to production and the common problems with them. At the end of the section, we will introduce a feature store in the ML pipeline and look at how it resolves the common problems that other alternatives struggle with. </p>
