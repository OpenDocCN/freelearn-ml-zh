    that you can provide freedom to end users and full control to administrators.
    You will learn about business values by using AppDefense, which uses machine learning
    to create an intent-based manifest for an app running in a VM. It can properly
    secure the app against malicious behavior with an algorithm that measures the
    running state against the intended state.

    practices, and VMware has developed a unique approach to solving this problem.
    In contrast to traditional security solutions, which focus on chasing threats,
    VMware AppDefense leverages its position in the hypervisor to learn the intended
    state of an application and immediately respond to deviations from that state.
    This level of application visibility results in more accurate security policies
    and faster remediation, simplifying the prevention of malicious behavior. This
    result is a common source of truth for IT and security teams, making it easy for
    them to collaborate on compliance, security incident investigation, and incident
    response.

    the application details from automation and provisioning tools, such as vCenter,
    Puppet, and Ansible, in order to understand the intent of a particular machine
    and application. It then monitors the behavior of the VM, operating system, processes,
    and application, and correlates this information with the intent that's defined
    during provisioning. AppDefense creates a blueprint based on known good behavior
    for how the machine and application should be functioning and communicating, by
    using machine learning.

    it can natively respond through a variety of capabilities and through NSX Data

    handle single problem and not have complete solution) or tool, as these are more
    basic and architectural in character. AppDefense makes security an inherent part
    of the network and application fabric where in businesses are running. Security
    is a native part of data center endpoints, which consist of applications, by implanting
    AppDefense within vSphere kernel. AppDefense helps its customers tackle the growing
    frequency and costs of security incident points in security models, which mostly focus
    on unidentified threats. AppDefense conveys a purpose-based security model that
    determines what the applications are supposed to do—the known correct. Compare
    this to what the hackers will do—the known incorrect.

    for AppDefense services. If AppDefense is integrated with NSX, automated response
    techniques like automatically quarantine a compromised data center endpoint can
    be leveraged. AppDefense is outstanding in a new security model which has a native,
    purpose-based, and application-centric approach. AppDefense will do the same job
    for compute that NSX does for the network, by creating least-privilege environments
    for business applications. We can monitor running applications against their desired
    states and can investigate them with an automated response to attacks that try
    to exploit applications.

    tools, like Device Guard, Credential Guard, and AppLocker, since these are built
    for Windows only, and will not support Linux workloads. Additionally, none of
    these solutions are designed to detect and respond to threats on data center endpoints.
    VBS uses the hypervisor to help protect the kernel and other parts of the operating
    system. AppDefense is focused on the application. Protecting the application means
    protecting the integrity and behavior of the application components, not just
    the OS. AppDefense provides OS protection, even if VBS is not present or enabled.
    AppDefense also provides the SOC with the ability to detect and respond to any
    compromises. Device Guard is focused on whitelisting which executables are allowed
    to run on a machine. It does not perform behavior whitelisting. It doesn't take
    an application-centric view of creating, updating, and monitoring these policies.
    It doesn't support automated response integration. All of these are essential
    parts of delivering a solution that can be used efficiently by SOCs. AppLocker
    is the older application whitelisting solution that's focused on end user endpoints,
    and it suffers from all of the problems that is had with traditional whitelisting.
    There is significant confusion about when to use AppLocker, as opposed to Device
    Guard.
  prefs: []

- en: AppDefense does whitelisting and behavioral analysis for an application. Traditional
    whitelisting is based on monitoring and validating what is allowed to be installed
    on a machine. However, this approach misses the behavioral component. What is
    the machine allowed to do? AppDefense incorporates both of these components into
    its approach to determine the application's intended state. AppDefense also takes
    a holistic view of application behavior, rather than focusing solely on individual
    data center endpoints. AppDefense stores VM inventory, machine names, expected
    process behaviors, expected network flows, and security alarms in the cloud. AppDefense
    holds metadata about the customer's data center environment and security status.
    AppDefense won't store any application data in the cloud, and does not handle
    any actual application data from customers. The only data that's stored is what

    It also includes behavioral information, like the network interactions between
    the various processes. AppDefense also ties into provisioning systems like vRealize
    Automation, Puppet, and others, to get composition information about the intended
    state. It then augments that with the runtime discovery of behavior to create
    a comprehensive and verified intended state. If a VM moves between hosts or clusters
    using vMotion, the AppDefense policy moves with it, similar to NSX. The administrative
