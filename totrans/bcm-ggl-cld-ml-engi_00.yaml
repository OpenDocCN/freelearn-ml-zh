    in 1946, computers have been so widely used and have become an integral part of
    our lives. It’s impossible to imagine a world without computers.

    world, and its three vertices represent today’s most advanced computer technologies
    – A for Artificial intelligence, B for Big data, and C for Cloud computing, as
    you can see from the following figure. These technologies are reshaping our world
    and changing our lives every day.

    (computer) to simulate human behavior. **Machine learning** (**ML**) is a subset
    of AI that lets a machine automatically learn from past data and predict based
    on the data. AI was introduced to the world around 1956, shortly after the invention
    of ENIAC, but in recent years, AI has gained momentum because of the accumulation
    of big data and the development of cloud computing.'

    stored in the past years. In 2018, the total amount of data created and consumed
    was about 33 zettabytes (1 ZB =8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bits) worldwide.
    This number grew to 59 ZB in 2020 and is predicted to reach a mind-boggling 175
    ZB by 2025\. To process these big data sets, huge amounts of computing power are
    needed. It is inconceivable to process these huge data sets on commodity computers,
    not to mention the time it takes for a company to deploy traditional data centers
    to place these computers. Big data processing calls for new ways to provision
    computing powers.'

    the idea of AI. Cloud computing provides computing powers featuring elastic, self-provisioning,
    and on-demand services. In a traditional computing model, infrastructure is conceived
    as hardware. Hardware solutions are physical – they require space, staff, planning,
    physical security, and capital expenditure – thus they have a long hardware procurement
    cycle that involves acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining. The cloud computing
    model made the infrastructure as software – choose the cloud computing services
    that best match your business needs, provision and terminate those resources on-demand,
    scale the resources up and down elastically in an automated fashion based on demand,
    deploy the infrastructure/resources as immutable codes that are managed with version
    control, and pay for what you use. With the cloud computing model, computing resources
    are treated as temporary and disposable: they can be used much more quickly, easily,
    and cost-effectively. The cloud computing model made AI computing feasible.'

    is a leader in the *ABC Triangle* technologies. As an ML pioneer, Google developed
    AlphaGo in 2017, the first computer program that defeated a professional human
    Go world champion. AlphaGo was trained on thousands of human amateur and professional
    games to learn how to play Go. AlphaZero skips this step and learns to play against
    itself – it quickly surpassed the human level of play and defeated AlphaGo by
    100 games to 0\. In addition to the legendary AlphaGo and AlphaZero, Google has
    developed numerous ML models and applications in many areas, including vision,
    voice, and language processing. In the cloud computing arena, Google is one of
    the biggest cloud computing service providers in the world. **Google Cloud Platform**
    (**GCP**) provides the best cloud services on earth, especially in the areas of
    big data and ML. Many companies are keen to use Google Cloud and leverage the
    GCP ML services for their business use cases. And this is the purpose of our book.
    We aim to learn about and master *the best of the best* – ML in Google Cloud.

    Python programming language. We introduce the concept of cloud computing and GCP,
    and briefly look at the basic GCP services including compute, storage, networking,
    database, big data, and machine learning. We go through an overview of the Python
    language basics, programming structures, and control flows. We then discuss the
    Python data science libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matpotlib, and Seaborn,
    to better understand their functions and use cases.
