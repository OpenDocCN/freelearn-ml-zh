    everyday lives, cloud-based machine learning services are part of a rising billion-dollar
    industry. Among the several services currently available on the market, Amazon
    Machine Learning stands out for its simplicity. Amazon Machine Learning was launched
    in April 2015 with a clear goal of lowering the barrier to predictive analytics
    by offering a service accessible to companies without the need for highly skilled
    technical resources.

    service and the types of predictive analytics problems it can solve. The Amazon
    Machine Learning platform distinguishes itself by its simplicity and straightforwardness.
    However, simplicity often implies that hard choices have been made. We explain
    what was sacrificed, why these choices make sense, and how the resulting simplicity
    can be extended with other services in the rich data-focused AWS ecosystem.

    Scala, and so on) within the Amazon ML platform, it is possible and recommended
    to use other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, to preprocess the datasets. Data
    manipulation beyond the transformations available in Amazon ML can also be carried
    out with SQL if your data is stored in one of the AWS SQL enabled services (Athena,
    RDS, Redshift, and others).

    factors of the phenomenon. The goal here is to establish/build a somewhat static
    and fully known model that will fit observations as well as possible and, therefore,

- en: In the machine learning approach, in predictive analytics, an explicit representation
    of the model is not the focus. The goal is to build the best model for the prediction
    period, and the model builds itself from the observations. The internals of the
    models are not explicit. This machine learning approach is called a black box
    model.

    a stronger potential for predictions. ML is focused on making the most accurate
    predictions possible by minimizing the prediction error of a model at the expense
    of explainability.

    ML service. Although Amazon ML offers fewer features than other machine learning
    workflows, Amazon ML is built on a solid ground, with a simple yet very efficient
    algorithm driving its predictions.

    will not be adequate in some contexts and some datasets. However, its simple approach
    and design will be sufficient for many predictive analytics projects, on the condition
    that the initial dataset is properly preprocessed and contains relevant signals
    on which predictions can be made.

    the predictions when faced with poor predictive performance.
