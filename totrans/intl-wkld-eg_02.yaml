    (**E2E**) development of solutions that run at the **edge**, the space in the
    computing topology nearest to where the analog interfaces the digital and vice
    versa. Specifically, the book focuses on those edge use cases where **machine

    decision-making beyond the cloud. You will learn about the scope of the E2E project
    that you will build using AWS services such as **AWS IoT Greengrass** and **Amazon
    SageMaker**. You will also learn what kinds of technical requirements are needed
    before moving on to the first hands-on chapter, [*Chapter 2*](B17595_02_Final_SS_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor032),

    interfaces the digital and vice versa. The edge of the first computing systems,
    such as 1945's **Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer** (**ENIAC**) general-purpose
    computer, was simply the interfaces used to input instructions and receive printed
    output. You couldn't access these interfaces without being directly in front of
    them. With the advent of remote access mainframe computing in the 1970s, the edge
    of computing moved further out to public terminals that fit on a desk and connected
    to mainframes via coaxial cable. Users could access the common resources of the
    local mainframe from the convenience of a lab or workstation to complete their
    work with advanced capabilities such as word processors or spreadsheets.

    in compute power and decreases in size and cost. The devices we use every day,
    such as personal computers and smartphones, deliver myriad outcomes for us. Some
    outcomes are delivered entirely at the edge (on the device), but many work only
    when connected to the internet and consume remote services. Edge workloads for
    humans tend to be diverse, multipurpose, and handle a range of dynamisms. We could
    not possibly enumerate everything we could do with a smartphone and its web browser!
    These examples of the edge all have in common that humans are both the operator
    and recipient of a computing task. However, the edge is more than the interface
    between humans and silicon.

    We design computing machines to sense and act, then deploy them in environments
    where there may be no human interaction at all. Examples of the autonomous edge
    include robotics used in manufacturing assembly, satellites, and weather stations.
    These edge workloads are distinct from human-driven workloads in that they tend
    to be highly specialized, single-purpose, and handle little dynamism. They perform
    a specific set of functions, perform them consistently, and repeat them until
    obsolescence. The following figure provides a simplistic history of both human-driven

    interoperating the digital world with the analog world*. If the analog world is
    a set of properties we can measure about reality and enact changes back upon it,
    the digital world is the information we capture about reality that we can store,
    transmit, and reason about. A cyber-physical solution can be self-contained or
    a closed loop such as a **programmable logic controller** (**PLC**) in an industrial
    manufacturing shop or a digital thermostat in the home. It may perform some task
    autonomously or at the direction of a local actor such as a person or switch.

    for an edge solution. The kinds of solutions that we are interested in developing
    have far more complexity to them. Your responsibility as an IoT architect is to
    ensure that edge solutions are secure, reliable, performant, and cost-effective.
    The high bar of a well-architected solution means you'll need to build proficiency
    in fundamentals such as networking, cryptography, electrical engineering, and
    operating systems. Today's practical production edge solutions incorporate capabilities
    such as processing real-time signals, communicating between systems over multiple
    transmission media, writing firmware updates with redundant failure recovery,

    the amount of time it takes to train ML models. Data scientists and data engineers
    can train production models in hours instead of days. Advances in ML algorithms
    have made the models themselves ever more portable, meaning that running the models
    can work on computers with smaller compute and memory profiles. The implications
    of delivering portable ML models cannot be overstated.

    depending on the results of ML inferences by not waiting for the round-trip latency
    of a call to a remote server. The latency to interpret myriad signals from an
    engine about to fail can be made in 10 **milliseconds** (**ms**) instead of 100
    ms. This degree of latency can make the difference between a safe operation and
    a catastrophic failure.

    network congestion and can run in a state where the edge solution is disconnected
    from the public internet. This opens up possibilities for ML solutions to run
    untethered from cloud services. That imminent engine failure can be detected and
    prevented regardless of connection availability.

    of data that ultimately needs to be stored in the cloud, we also get the cost-saving
    benefits on transmission. Think of an expensive satellite internet provider contract;
    across that kind of transmission medium, IoT architects only want to transmit
    data that is absolutely necessary to keep costs down.

    images coming from a video feed. The drone can operate and make inferences on
    images away from any network connection and can discard any images that don't
    have any value. For example, if the drone's mission is to bring back only images
    of narwhals, then the drone doesn't need extensive quantities of storage to save
    every video clip for later analysis. The drone can use ML to classify images of
    narwhals and only preserve those for the trip back home. The cost of storage continues
    to drop over time, but in the precious bill of materials and space considerations
    of edge solutions such as this one, bringing a portable ML model can ultimately

    that benefit from the power of the cloud. These services range from edge software,
    such as the FreeRTOS real-time operating system for microcontrollers, to **command

    suite of ML services, enabling developers to ingest massive quantities of data
    for use in training ML models with services such as Amazon SageMaker. AWS also

    and undetected real security events. The next level of smart security will require
    complex event detection that analyzes multivariate inputs and confidence scores
    from trained models. Local models can evaluate whether the consumer is home or
    away automatically, and the solution can use that to calibrate sensitivity to
    events and escalate notifications of events. Video camera feeds are a classic
    example of a high data rate use case that becomes significantly cheaper to use

    improves on this by reading weather forecasts, building a schedule profile of
    who is present in the home, and obeying rules for economical operation. ML can
    take us even further by analyzing a wider variety of inputs to determine via a
    recommendation engine how to achieve personal comfort targets most sustainably.
    For example, an ML model might identify and tell us that for your specific home,
    the most sustainable way to cool off in the evenings is to run the air conditioning
    in 5-minute bursts over 2 hours instead of frontloading for 30 minutes.'

    and people that can get value from it. Data has little value when it is ingested
    at the edge but stored in an on-premises silo that can't afford to ship it to
    the cloud for analysis. This is where today's edge solutions can turn data into

    machinery to perform work. This machinery, such as a sheet metal press, **computer
    numerical control** (**CNC**) router, or an excavator, only performs optimally
    for so many duty cycles before a maintenance operation is needed or, worse, before
    they experience a failure while on the job. The need to keep machinery in top
    condition while minimizing downtime and expenses on unnecessary maintenance is
    a leading use case for industrial IoT and edge solutions. Training models and
    deploying them at the edge for predictive maintenance detection not only saves
    businesses from expensive downtime events but builds on the benefits of local
    ML by ensuring smooth operations in remote environments without high-speed or
    consistent network access.'

    solutions raise the bar on workplace safety with applications such as **computer
    vision** (**CV**) models to detect when an employee is about to enter a hazardous
    environment without the required safety equipment, such as a hard hat or safety
    vest. Similar solutions can also be used to detect when unauthorized personnel
    are entering (or trying to enter) a restricted area. When it comes to human safety,
    latency and availability are paramount, so running a fully functional solution
    at the edge means bringing the ML capabilities with it.'

    product on a manufacturing line, they know which aspects of quality to inspect
    based on a trained reference (every batch of cookies should taste like this cookie),
    comparison to a specification (thickness, sheen, strength of aluminum foil), or
    human perception (do these two blocks of wood have reasonably similar wood grain
    to be used together?). ML innovates how manufacturers, for example, can capture
    the intuition of human quality inspectors to increase the scale and precision
    of their operations. With sensors such as cameras and CV models deployed to the
    manufacturing environment, it is feasible to inspect every component or final
    product (instead of an arbitrary sample) with a statistically consistent evaluation
    applied every time. This also brings a benefit to **quality assurance** (**QA**)
    teams by shifting the focus to inspecting solution performance instead of working
    on highly repetitive tasks dependent upon rapid subjective analysis. In other
    words, I''d rather QA a sample of 10,000 items passing inspection from an ML solution
    instead of every one of those 10,000 items. Running such a solution at the edge
    delivers on the key benefits of reducing overall data sent to the cloud and minimizing
    latency for the solution to produce results.'
