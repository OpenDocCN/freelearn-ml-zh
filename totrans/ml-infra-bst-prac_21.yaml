    the differences between traditional and machine learning-based software. We’ve
    learned how to handle data and how to work with algorithms. We’ve also looked
    at how to deploy models and how to work ethically with machine learning. In this
    chapter, we’ll summarize the best practices and try to get a glimpse of future
    developments in the area of machine learning overlapped with software engineering.

    I got my hands on that computer, I was amazed by the sheer fact that it could
    do what I told it to do. My first program was, of course, a program in BASIC:'

    do at the time. This first program shaped my entire career as it sparked my interest
    in software development. Later on, during my professional career, I realized that
    professional software engineering is much more than just writing source code and
    compiling it. The programs need to be well-formed, well-documented, well-designed,
    and well-tested (among many other things). This observation, in turn, shaped my
    view on software engineering as a discipline that can turn homebrewed software
    into a piece of art that can be used over long periods if well maintained. That
    was in the early 2000s. Around 2015, I saw a potential in machine learning that
    also sparked my interest. The first project that I took part in was done by a
    colleague of mine who showed me how a random forest classifier can interpret programming
    language code and make inferences about defects. Fast forward to today, we have
    transformers, diffusers, autoencoders, and hybrid networks that can do amazing
    things with data.

    software development to software engineering. That brings us to this book, where
    I showed over 70 best practices in AI engineering. This book has taken us from
    the basic concepts of machine learning and AI in *Part I*, through handling data
    in *Part II* to algorithms and models in *Part III*. We also explored the ethical
    and legal aspects of designing, using, and deploying machine learning systems
    in *Part IV*.

    very good software with moderately large models such as GPT-3.5\. This brings
    us to some of the current topics that we, as a community, need to discuss. One
    of them is the energy sustainability of these models. Falcon-170B requires 400
    GB of RAM (eight times that of an Nvidia A100 GPU) to execute (according to Hugging
    Face). We do not know how much hardware the GPT-4 model needs. The amount of electricity
    that it takes and the resources that it uses must be on par with what we get as
    value from that model.

    formalism is quite appealing, it is not without its challenges. Machine learning
    systems/models need to be re-designed to fit the new paradigm and the new paradigm
    needs to be more accessible for AI engineers and software engineers.

    mostly due to the attention behind the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) (Rosenberg
    2016, Rajeesh Kumar, Jaya Lakshmi, et al. 2023). With the support of technologies
    such as 5G and 6G in telecommunication, these developments are clearly on the
    rise and will continue to rise. However, one of the current challenges is fragmenting
    the protocols and technologies, which leads to challenges related to cybersecurity
    and attacks on critical infrastructure.

    neural networks* (Gao, Zheng, et al. 2023). As the current architectures are limited
    to linear data or data or data that can be linearized, they cannot handle certain
    tasks. Programming language models are one example of such an area – although
    they are capable of many tasks, they cannot consider execution graphs or similar
    elements at the moment. Therefore, the graph neural models are seen to be the
    next development, although the main challenge to address there is related to the
    computational power needed for training and inference in the graph neural models.

- en: Language models will get better at completing software engineering tasks, such
    as requirements, testing, and documenting. This means that software engineers
    will be able to focus on their core work – engineering software – rather than
    on tedious, repetitive tasks. We will see models that will test software, document
    it, explain it, and maybe even repair it. The latest advancements in this field
    are very promising.

- en: Hybrid models will be more popular. Combining symbolic analysis and neural networks
    will gain traction and be able to assist us in finding advanced vulnerabilities
    in software, as well as identifying them before they are exploited. This will
    make our software more robust and more resilient over time.

- en: Large models and the availability of significant computational power will help
    us also to detect anomalies in software operations. By analyzing logs, we will
    be able to predict aging and we will be able to direct maintenance effort. Again,
    we will be able to focus on software engineering rather than on analysis.

- en: And last, but not least, hybrid models will help us with design tasks. Combining
    image generation and other types of methods will help us in designing software
    – its architecture and detailed design, and even predicting the operational performance
    of the software.

    with new models being introduced almost every week. Make sure that you observe
    the scientific publications in this area and commercial developments. This will
    help you keep your knowledge up-to-date and help you advance in your professional
    career.
