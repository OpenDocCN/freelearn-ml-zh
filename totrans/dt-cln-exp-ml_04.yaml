    so seemingly small and trivial that is as of much consequence as the missing value.
    We spend a good deal of our time worrying about missing values because they can
    have a dramatic, and surprising, effect on our analysis. This is most likely to
    happen when missing values are not random – that is, when they are correlated
    with a feature or target. For example, let's say we are doing a longitudinal study
    of earnings, but individuals with lower education are more likely to skip the
    earnings question each year. There is a decent chance that this will bias our
    parameter estimate for education.

- en: Of course, identifying missing values is not even half of the battle. We then
    need to decide how to handle them. Do we remove any observation with a missing
    value for one or more features? Do we impute a value based on a sample-wide statistic
    such as the mean? Or do we assign a value based on a more targeted statistic,
    such as the mean for those in a certain class? Do we think of this differently
    for time series or longitudinal data where the nearest temporal value may make
    the most sense? Or should we use a more complex multivariate technique for imputing
    values, perhaps based on linear regression or **k-nearest neighbors** (**KNN**)?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer to all of these questions is *yes*. At some point, we will want to
    use each of these techniques. We will want to be able to answer why or why not
    to all of these possibilities when making a final choice about missing value imputation.
    Each will make sense, depending on the situation.

    each feature or target, and for observations where values for a large number of
    the features are absent. Then, we will explore strategies for imputing values,
    such as setting values to the overall mean, to the mean for a given category,
    or forward filling. We will also examine multivariate techniques for imputing

    values for all the missing values in the passed DataFrame, `wagedata`. `fit_transform`
    returns a NumPy array that contains all the non-missing values from `wagedata`,
    plus the imputed ones. We can convert this array into a DataFrame using the same
    index as `wagedata`. This will make it easy to join the data in the next step.

    the underlying data. With regression imputation, the standard assumptions for
    linear regression apply – that is, that there is a linear relationship between
    features and that they are distributed normally. If this is not the case, KNN
    is likely a better approach for imputation.
  prefs: []

- en: Despite these advantages, KNN imputation does have limitations. First, we must
    tune the model with an initial assumption about a good value for k, sometimes
    informed by little more than our knowledge of the size of the dataset. KNN is
    also computationally expensive and may be impractical for very large datasets.
    Finally, KNN imputation may not perform well when the correlation is weak between
    the feature to be imputed and the predictor features. An alternative to KNN for
    imputation, random forest imputation, can help us avoid the disadvantages of both
    KNN and regression imputation. We will explore random forest imputation in the
    next section.

- en: Random forest is an ensemble learning method. It uses bootstrap aggregating,
    also known as bagging, to improve model accuracy. It makes predictions by repeatedly
    taking the mean of multiple trees, yielding progressively better estimates. We
    will use the `MissForest` algorithm in this section, which is an application of
    the random forest algorithm to find missing value imputation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`MissForest` starts by filling in the median or mode (for continuous or categorical
    features, respectively) for missing values, then uses random forest to predict
    values. Using this transformed dataset, with missing values replaced with initial
    predictions, `MissForest` generates new predictions, perhaps replacing the initial
    prediction with a better one. `MissForest` will typically go through at least
    four iterations of this process.'

    Unlike KNN, it doesn''t need to be tuned with an initial value for k. It also

    imputation is less sensitive to low or very high correlation among features, though

- en: In this chapter, we explored the most popular approaches for missing value imputation
    and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Assigning an
    overall sample mean is not usually a good approach, particularly when observations
    with missing values are different from other observations in important ways. We
    can also substantially reduce our variance. Forward or backward filling allows
    us to maintain the variance in our data, but it works best when the proximity
    of observations is meaningful, such as with time series or longitudinal data.
    In most non-trivial cases, we will want to use a multivariate technique, such
    as regression, KNN, or random forest imputation.

    to work with training data independently of the testing data as soon as we begin

    the next chapter. There, we will encode, transform, and scale features, while
    also being careful to separate the training and testing data.
