<p><a href="B16690_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">An Overview of LightGBM in Python</em>, examines LightGBM, an advanced gradient-boosting framework with tree-based learners. Highlighting its unique innovations and enhancements to ensemble learning, we will guide you through its Python APIs. A comprehensive modeling example using LightGBM, enriched with advanced validation and optimization techniques, sets the stage for a deeper dive into data science and production <span class="No-Break">systems ML.</span></p>
<p><a href="B16690_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Comparing LightGBM, XGBoost, and Deep Learning</em>, pits LightGBM against two prominent tabular data modeling methods – XGBoost and <strong class="bold">deep neural networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNNs</strong>), specifically TabTransformer.
