			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>How Machine Learning and Deep Learning Help in MSA Enterprise Systems</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapters, we analyzed the different general concepts of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, and how they can be used for certain applications and use cases. From there, we looked at how to create an end-to-end machine learning system pipeline and the advantages it brings when establishing a robust system. Finally, we examined the different ways our machine learning model can degrade over time through data shifts, and the different ways we can identify and <span class="No-Break">address them.</span></p>
			<p>Having a firm understanding of the basics of machine learning, we can now begin to explore the <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>use cases of machine learning in our <strong class="bold">Microservice Service Architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">MSA</strong>) enterprise. In this chapter, we will go over the different concepts we will be proposing when integrating machine learning in to an MSA enterprise system to establish an <span class="No-Break">intelligent MSA.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Machine learning MSA enterprise system use cases</h1>
			<p>The space <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>for adding machine learning to MSA enterprise systems is broad and can be open for many use cases. We can use machine learning for different types of problems that we can encounter in MSA, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">System Load Prediction</strong>: This will determine when a service is experiencing higher <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>than usual loads and trigger measures to prevent the system from degrading due to excessive <span class="No-Break">server loads.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">System Decay Prediction</strong>: Similar <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>to system load prediction, this will monitor the microservices and try to predict and determine anomalies in the MSA enterprise, allowing users to act and prevent certain issues from arising and negatively <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>impacting <span class="No-Break">the performance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">System Security</strong>: In the age of cybersecurity, it is important to be able to protect <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>your MSA system from targeted attacks. By studying the behavior of your MSA system, the model can predict and detect attacks that could be impacting <span class="No-Break">your system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">System Resource Planning</strong>: As your system grows and evolves, being able to properly <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>allocate resources and adapt to your system needs is a critical part when establishing your MSA enterprise system. With machine learning, we can learn which services require more resources and how much we need to scale in order to allocate the required resources efficiently <span class="No-Break">and effectively.</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p>While there are many more use cases of machine learning in MSA enterprise systems, most use <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>cases fall under these four categories. Before getting into the implementation of the different models, we need to first get an overview of the different cases and how we need to solve these <span class="No-Break">different problems.</span></p>
			<p>We can start by looking at system load predictions. This is a common issue that we will encounter when it comes to dealing with services in general. MSA has an advantage compared to monolithic systems, where the resources are dedicated to each microservice, allowing easier maintenance and scalability. As discussed in previous chapters, though, there could be cases where, in MSA, a microservice experiences a high load and, as a result, causes a cascading effect where the failures expand to <span class="No-Break">other microservices.</span></p>
			<p>With an intelligent MSA, we can train a model using different features, such as the response time, to learn the patterns of the MSA system. Similar to a microservice circuit breaker, this model will be able to swiftly determine whether a microservice is experiencing a heavy load and address the issue before it becomes too late and starts negatively impacting the <span class="No-Break">other microservices.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2: System load prediction model</p>
			<p>Just like the system load prediction model, we can build a model to find anomalies within <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>the MSA that could lead to decaying services. Rather than focusing only on the service load for a specific microservice, we can study the entire MSA and learn the different patterns of how it operates at a <span class="No-Break">larger scale.</span></p>
			<p>Certain systems can experience different system loads and bugs over certain times and periods. For example, our service may encounter spikes in requests over certain periods such as holidays and seasonal events, where the user count may drastically increase. Allowing the model to learn and understand the MSA and how it operates over time can prepare the model to better detect anomalies and prevent <span class="No-Break">false positives.</span></p>
			<p>Also, rather than monitoring separate microservices, we can evaluate clusters of microservices and how they interact with the entire MSA. This way, we can identify certain bottlenecks and bugs that could arise in <span class="No-Break">our MSA.</span></p>

			<p>Machine learning has been thriving in the security field. With more advanced attacks and methods, it has become imperative for users to protect their systems. Machine <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>learning has made it easier for users to create robust models that can analyze and predict attacks before they can even impact their systems, and MSA is <span class="No-Break">no different.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Denial of Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoS</strong>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>cyber-attack intended to prevent users from accessing certain services. These attacks are becoming more sophisticated with the advancements in technology. With machine learning, we can train our model to learn about our MSA and simulate DoS attacks such that it can be able to determine whether our MSA is under attack. With that, we can notify the security team or deploy countermeasures to fight back against certain attacks and maintain the integrity of <span class="No-Break">our MSA.</span></p>

			<p>A part of the <strong class="bold">self-healing</strong> process <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>includes resource allocation for certain microservices when your MSA begins to grow and expand. After a time, you may experience a growth in users and as a result, your microservices will have increased request volume. A model may incorrectly identify a problem and offer solutions that wouldn’t address the <span class="No-Break">core problem.</span></p>
			<p>Thus, building an advanced model where it can track the gradual growth of the MSA and determine <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>when certain services need more resources can be a critical part of the system’s self-healing process. A successful implementation of the model can greatly improve system reliability as it can properly and efficiently allocate resources <span class="No-Break">more effectively.</span></p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">The different types of models we can use in our MSA are not mutually exclusive. It is possible, and common, to combine the different use cases to build a more intelligent MSA. Understanding how your MSA operates and determining the different weaknesses it may have makes it easier for the user to determine which models <span class="No-Break">to approach.</span></p>
			<p>With certain use cases, some models can work better than others due to the nature of the problem. Now that we have looked at the different concepts where we can apply machine learning to our MSA, we can begin to dive deep into the different implementations and models we can use to build our machine learning models in the next <span class="No-Break">few sections.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Enhancing system supportability and time-to-resolution (TTR) with pattern analysis machine learning</h1>
			<p>Before we can begin to make our MSA intelligent, we must first understand how our system <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>performs by leveraging machine learning models to learn the common trends and patterns for the performance of our services. From there, we can establish a baseline that <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>can be used as a reference for other advanced models <span class="No-Break">to use.</span></p>
			<p>As discussed in <a href="B18934_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, supervised learning can occur when we have a labeled test set. For <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>our case, we can mostly use supervised learning because we can easily capture the response time of our services in the MSA and use that as our <span class="No-Break">data label.</span></p>
			<p>From <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>there, we have a wide variety of techniques that we can use to create our machine learning model. For simplicity, we can use a linear regression model to predict the expected response time for a particular microservice. Using this output, we can design a system where we can configure a set threshold where, if we detect that our MSA will reach a certain response time, we can notify the developers or initiate a program to resolve the issue before <span class="No-Break">it occurs.</span></p>
			<p>If we recall from <a href="B18934_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, we discussed data shifts and how they can impact our model. It’s common for MSAs to grow and expand as time passes due to an increase in user counts or seasonal occasions. As a result, we may see a growth in response times and metrics for our MSA. This may falsely trigger an alert notifying us of abnormal response times when, in reality, it accurately depicts the normal behavior of <span class="No-Break">the MSA.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, it is important to continuously collect data and train our model to adapt to expected <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>changes <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>such that it is able to learn how the system grows and to correctly identify changes that are not common to <span class="No-Break">our MSA.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.6: Performance baseline system flow</p>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>this system is enough for simple problems, we can combine this model output <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>with other advanced models to create a more end-to-end system, where we can understand the health of the MSA and make better decisions. In the next section, we will discuss how we can use deep learning to implement self-healing for <span class="No-Break">our system.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">It’s important to start with a simple model, such as a linear regression model. Once the proof of concept works, you can improve your system by incorporating more advanced models <span class="No-Break">and techniques.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Implementing system self-healing with deep learning</h1>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>we have determined <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>the baseline for our system, we can use this to our advantage to create a more intelligent MSA, where we can detect anomalies and perform system self-healing. This way, we can be more proactive in resolving issues before they arise and save cost <span class="No-Break">and time.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Anomaly detection</strong> is an effective method for identifying any abnormal events or trends that <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>may occur in a system or service. For example, we can use anomaly detection for determining credit card fraud. We can use the user’s purchasing trends and, based on that information, we can determine when the user has been a victim of credit <span class="No-Break">card fraud.</span></p>
			<p>Similar to credit card fraud detection, we can apply our anomaly detection to our MSA. Before we can go to the different models that we can use to achieve our anomaly detection, let us first understand the different types <span class="No-Break">of anomalies:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Point Anomaly</strong>: This occurs <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>when an individual <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>point is far off from the rest of <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contextual Anomaly</strong>: Data is <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>considered <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>this way when it is not in line with the general data trend due to the context of <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collective Anomaly</strong>: When a <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>group of <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>related data instances is anomalous with respect to the <span class="No-Break">whole dataset</span></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.7: Anomalous data</p>
			<p>An anomaly detection model can be done in the <span class="No-Break">following ways:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supervised </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Anomaly Detection</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Unsupervised </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Anomaly Detection</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A common <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>model we can use for unsupervised learning <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>is an <strong class="bold">autoencoder</strong>. As mentioned in <a href="B18934_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, an autoencoder is a neural network composed of an encoder and a decoder. The general purpose of <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>an autoencoder is to take the data and compress it to a lower dimension similar to PCA. That way, it is able to learn the correlations and patterns between the different data features. Once it learns the patterns, it can feed the compressed data forward to the decoder where it tries to “recreate” the original data with what it has learned in the <span class="No-Break">encoder stage.</span></p>
			<p>While experts can study the data to determine what response times are considered an anomaly for a particular MSA, we can leverage machine learning to help us find patterns and relationships that may be hard to see even for an <span class="No-Break">experienced developer.</span></p>
			<p>With the learned parameters, we can then use this in our supervised regression models to achieve <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>more accurate results when detecting anomalies <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>and prevent false positives <span class="No-Break">from occurring.</span></p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Labeling data to be used in a supervised machine learning problem can cost time and money. You can leverage unsupervised machine learning models to help you predict and label your unlabeled data. From there, you can feed your newly labeled data into your supervised machine learning problem, thus taking advantage of unsupervised learning. Keep the newly labeled data in mind and make sure it doesn’t negatively impact your supervised machine <span class="No-Break">learning problem.</span></p>
			<p>These are some of the ways in which we can take advantage of machine learning and deep learning to create an intelligent MSA, where it can detect anomalies in the system and react swiftly. These use cases can be adjusted and enhanced based on the user’s needs and the demands of their MSA by using different models <span class="No-Break">and techniques.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter discussed how we can implement machine learning and deep learning in <span class="No-Break">our MSA.</span></p>
			<p>We first looked into the different use cases for how machine learning can be used to build an intelligent MSA. The uses cases can be grouped into <span class="No-Break">four categories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>System <span class="No-Break">Load Prediction</span></li>
				<li>System <span class="No-Break">Decay Prediction</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">System Security</span></li>
				<li>System <span class="No-Break">Resource Planning</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We discussed each category and what role it plays when looking into creating an <span class="No-Break">intelligent MSA.</span></p>
			<p>From there, we started looking into using supervised machine learning to create a pattern analysis model where it can learn our MSA and create a performance baseline model. Using this, we can determine whether our microservice performance is abnormal. We can then use this to either perform actions based on a threshold or use this baseline to build a more <span class="No-Break">advanced model.</span></p>
			<p>Along with our supervised machine learning model, we can use deep learning to create a more sophisticated model, such as autoencoders, to find anomalies in our MSA. Using the combination of these two models, we can create a set of rules to perform based on certain predictions, such as that our MSA can self-heal with minimal human intervention. This allows us to save time and money when repairing and debugging <span class="No-Break">our MSA.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapters, we will be taking what we’ve learned so far and starting to build our own MSA with practical examples and integrating machine learning to create our very own simple <span class="No-Break">intelligent MSA.</span></p>
