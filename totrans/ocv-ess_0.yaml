- en: OpenCV, arguably the most widely used computer vision library, includes hundreds
    of ready-to-use imaging and vision functions and is extensively used in both academia
    and industry. As cameras get cheaper and imaging features grow in demand, the
    range of applications taking advantage of OpenCV is increasing significantly,
    particularly for mobile platforms.

- en: The first book published on OpenCV provided a mostly theoretical approach, explaining
    the underlying computer vision techniques. Subsequent books have adopted the contrary
    approach, filling pages and pages with large examples (almost complete applications)
    that are difficult to follow. Large examples are difficult to follow and cannot
    be easily reused in the reader's projects. Examples taking up several pages are
    simply not appropriate for a book. We believe that examples should be easy to
    understand and should also be used as building blocks to reduce the time needed
    to have a working example for the reader's projects. Consequently, in this book,
    we also adopt a practical approach, although we aim to cover a larger spectrum
    of functions with shorter, easy-to-follow examples. From our experience with OpenCV,
    we can affirm that examples are ultimately the most valuable resource.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The approach followed in this book is particularly suited for readers who are
    already knowledgeable in computer vision (or can learn the discipline elsewhere)
    and want to start developing applications rapidly. Each chapter provides several
    examples of the key available functions for the most important stages in a vision
    system. The book is, therefore, focused on providing the reader with a working
    example as soon as possible so that he/she can develop additional features on
    top of that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use this book, only free software is needed. All the examples have been developed
    and tested with the freely available Qt IDE. The freely available CUDA toolkit
    is required for the GPU acceleration examples in [Chapter 8](part0066_split_000.html#page
    "Chapter 8. Advanced Topics"), *Advanced Topics*.
