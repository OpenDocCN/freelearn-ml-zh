  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This section concentrates on the significance of a feature store (*why?*) in
    **Machine Learning** (**ML**) pipelines. We will start with an ML problem and
    go through the different stages of ML development, such as data exploration, feature
    engineering, model training, and inference. We will discuss how the availability
    of features in production affects model performance and start looking into ways
    in which features are brought to production and the common problems with them.
    At the end of the section, we will introduce a feature store in the ML pipeline
    and look at how it resolves the common problems that other alternatives struggle
    with.
