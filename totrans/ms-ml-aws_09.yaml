- en: One of the main innovations in the field of AI and machine learning is the advent
    of deep learning algorithms. We dedicate this part of the book to deep learning
    algorithms and explain how readers can implement them using various technologies
    in AWS. We take a practical approach to explaining deep learning algorithms rather
    than a theoretical approach, and explain how deep learning works with help of
    several real-world examples. Readers will learn what deep learning is, the applications
    of deep learning, and how to implement deep learning systems on AWS.
