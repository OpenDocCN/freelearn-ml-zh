- en: There are many people who we are grateful to because their support, help, knowledge,
    and advice were instrumental in shaping this book. First of all, we would like
    to thank Tomás Fernández Marcos. He taught both of us — albeit in different millennia!
    — some of the mathematical notions that, in our future, would be indispensable
    for our study of quantum computing. Then, he introduced us to each other, because
    he had the prescient intuition that we would share many interesting projects.
    It is fair to say that, without him, this book would not exist.

    for us. The rest of the book can only go downhill from there!

- en: Many parts of this book originate from courses on quantum computing taught over
    the years. Those courses would not have been possible without the help and trust
    of Enrique Arias, Alberto Di Meglio, Melissa Gaillard, Ester Martín Garzón and
    José Ranilla, among others.

- en: We are also indebted to all the colleagues with whom we have discussed different
    topics on quantum computing and from whom we have learned a lot. We are particularly
    grateful to those who gave us very useful feedback and comments on preliminary
    versions of our lectures and of material for this book, including Vasilis Belis,
    Héctor García Morales, Miguel Hernández-Cáceres, Carla Rieger, Ignacio F. Rúa,
    Bruno Santidrián Manzanedo, Daniel Setó, Erik Skibinsky Gitlin, and Sofia Vallecorsa.
    We also want to give heartfelt thanks to Ferdous Khan. He was the first to suggest
    that our lectures should be collected in book form. We cannot overstate how much
    we appreciate his constant encouragement and support.

- en: Of course, we would also like to thank our team at Packt. They believed in our
    ability to write a whole book on quantum computing much more than we did ourselves!
    And they provided many useful suggestions and advice, making the complicated process
    of preparing a technical manuscript as smooth as possible.

- en: We’ve been extremely lucky to have such wonderful technical reviewers as Guillermo
    Botella and Francisco Orts. They went well beyond the call of duty to check that
    everything was correct, they gave us invaluable feedback and suggestions, and
    they located quite a number of errata and typos that would have been very embarrassing
    had they made it to the print version. Obviously, all remaining errors are our
    sole responsibility.

    Writing a book takes a lot of time. And when we say ”a lot,” we really mean ”an
    incredibly awful lot.” Sadly, we had to steal part of that time from them and,
    moreover, they had to listen to our complaints and worries when we went through
    rough spots in the writing process. If it weren’t for them, we could not have
    made it. This is all because of them and dedicated to them.
