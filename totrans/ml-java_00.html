<p>This book assumes that the user has a working knowledge of the Java language and a basic idea about machine learning. This book heavily uses external libraries that are available in JAR format. It is assumed that the user is aware of using JAR files in Terminal or Command Prompt, although the book does also explain how to do this. The user may easily use this book with any generic Windows or Linux system.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Unzip the archive and locate </span><kbd>weka.jar</kbd><span> within the extracted archive.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>data.defineSingleOutputOthersInput(outputColumn); <br/><br/>EncogModel model = new EncogModel(data); <br/>model.selectMethod(data, MLMethodFactory.TYPE_FEEDFORWARD);<br/>model.setReport(new ConsoleStatusReportable()); <br/>data.normalize(); </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ java -cp moa.jar -javaagent:sizeofag.jar moa.gui.GUI</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text as bold. Here is an example: "We can convert it to a <strong>Comma Separated Value</strong> (<strong>CSV</strong>) format by clicking <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Save As</span> and picking </span>CSV<span> in the saving dialog.</span><span>"</span></p>
