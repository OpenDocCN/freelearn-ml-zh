<p>The second revision of <em>Learning Data Mining with Python</em> was written with the programmer in mind. It aims to introduce data mining to a wide range of programmers, as I feel that this is critically important to all those in the computer science field. Data mining is quickly becoming the building block of the next generation of Artificial Intelligence systems. Even if you don't find yourself building these systems, you will be using them, interfacing with them, and being guided by them. Understand the process behind them is important and helps you get the best out of them.<br/>
The second revision builds upon the first. Many of chapters and exercises are similar, although new concepts are introduced and exercises are expanded in scope. Those that had read the first revision should be able to move quickly through the book and pick up new knowledge along the way and engage with the extra activities proposed. Those new to the book are encouraged to take their time, do the exercises and experiment. Feel free to break the code to understand it, and reach out if you have any questions.<br/>
As this is a book aimed at programmers, we assume that you have some knowledge of programming and of Python itself. For this reason, there is little explanation of what the&#160;<em>Python</em> code itself is doing, except in cases where it is ambiguous.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="NormalPACKT">It should come as no surprise that you’ll need a computer, or access to one, to complete the book. The computer should be reasonably modern, but it doesn’t need to be overpowered. Any modern processor (from about 2010 onwards) and 4 gigabytes of RAM will suffice, and you can probably run almost all of the code on a slower system too.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">The exception here is with the final two chapters. In these chapters, I step through using Amazon’s web services (AWS) for running the code. This will probably cost you some money, but the advantage is less system setup than running the code locally. If you don’t want to pay for those services, the tools used can all be set-up on a local computer, but you will definitely need a modern system to run it. A processor built in at least 2012, and more than 4 GB of RAM are necessary.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">I recommend the Ubuntu operating system, but the code should work well on Windows, Macs, or any other Linux variant. You may need to consult the documentation for your system to get some things installed though.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">In this book, I use <span class="KeyWordPACKT">pip</span> for installing code, which is a command line tool for installing Python libraries. Another option is to use Anaconda, which can be found online here: <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">I also have tested all code using Python 3. Most of the code examples work on Python 2 with no changes. If you run into any problems, and can’t get around it, send an email and we can offer a solution.</p>

<p>This book is for programmers that want to get started in data mining in an application-focused manner.</p>
<p>If you haven’t programmed before, I strongly recommend that you learn at least the basics before you get started. This book doesn’t introduce programming, nor does it give too much time to explaining the actual implementation (in-code) of how to type out the instructions. That said, once you go through the basics, you should be able to come back to this book fairly quickly – there is no need to be an expert programmer first!</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you have some Python programming experience. If you don’t, feel free to jump in, but you might want to take a look at some Python code first, possibly focused on tutorials using the IPython notebook. Writing programs in the IPython notebook works a little differently than other methods, such as writing a Java program in a fully-fledged IDE.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>The next lines of code read the link and assign it to the to the <kbd>dataset_filename</kbd></span><span>&#160;function.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>import numpy as np <br/>dataset_filename = "affinity_dataset.txt" <br/>X = np.loadtxt(dataset_filename)
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre> <strong>$ conda install scikit-learn</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "<span>In order to download new modules, we will go to</span> <span class="packt_screen">Files</span> <span>|&#160;</span><span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project Name</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project Interpreter</span><span>.</span>"</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
