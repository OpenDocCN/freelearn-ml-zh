    spoken and written language meaning. This utilizes a machine’s ability to analyze,
    understand, infer, and manipulate interactions that are human-like with their
    language response. With NLP, *algorithms* and *computing models* are built and

    that appear in a document; it can extract the commonality and frequency of words
    that appear to derive meaning from the topic and what the content of the document

    **natural language** (**NL**). This model converts sequences of words into “probabilities,”
    estimating the probability that a certain word will occur based on how words precede
    or follow it. One of the most prevalent approaches to language modeling is through
    **n-grams** or more advanced techniques, such as **recurrent neural networks**
