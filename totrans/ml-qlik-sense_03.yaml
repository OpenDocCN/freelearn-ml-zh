  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Critical thinking is one of the most important skills when working with data.
    In data literacy, critical thinking refers to the ability to evaluate data in
    a systematic and objective manner, considering potential biases, limitations,
    and errors. It involves questioning assumptions, analyzing evidence, and making
    informed judgments about the quality and reliability of the data. It also involves
    assessing the limitations of the analysis and recognizing the potential for false
    conclusions or overgeneralizations based on incomplete or insufficient data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One aspect of critical thinking is considering the broader context in which
    the data is being used. This includes understanding the goals of the analysis,
    the intended audience, and the potential implications of the findings. Skills
    developed in this area will help you to think analytically and draw conclusions
    that can lead to insights and actions. In a machine-learning context, this skill
    will help you to understand how to ask proper questions and how to create a suitable
    model for your analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, there are some habits that can be used to develop critical-thinking
    skills. First, you should question all assumptions and not take anything for granted.
    This way, you can start to develop a habit that can give you new ideas and perspective.
    You should also seek out diversity. This means simply ensuring that you discuss
    with other people and hear their views. This habit will make you better at recognizing
    biases that might represent your own point of view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, you should use pure logic when making decisions. It is a good idea to
    reason through each step to make sure that you understand the logic behind everything
    you do. For example, when planning a machine-learning deployment, it is always
    a good idea to go through each step of your plan and share the process and results
    with other people.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the time, you might have a comprehensive domain knowledge from the field
    you are working in, but sometimes being data literate in a certain topic will
    require research and studying. This could be, for example, cross-checking the
    results you get from your machine-learning model or simply finding good source
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another aspect of research is that it helps you to stay up to date with the
    latest developments and best practices in the field. With the rapid growth of
    data and the increasing importance of data-driven decision-making, there is always
    something to learn, and it is important to keep pace with new technologies, tools,
    and methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also an ethical aspect involved. Research skills are essential for
    addressing ethical considerations related to working with data, such as privacy
    concerns, biases, and the responsible use of data. By conducting research on these
    topics, you can ensure that you are using data in an ethical and responsible manner
    and contribute to the development of ethical guidelines and best practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Research means a lot more than using a search engine. It involves finding good
    sources and cross-referencing them. It also involves drawing conclusions and evaluating
    those carefully after the project is done. One method for efficient research is
    narrowing down. You can start with a broad approach and dig deeper into some of
    the topics. Never start researching with an outcome already in your mind and keep
    your mind open. Make sure to verify your sources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Combining research with domain knowledge that you have already acquired from
    previous experiences is an important skill. This approach will allow you to ask
    relevant questions, identify key variables, and interpret the data in a meaningful
    way. Combining research, domain knowledge, effective communication, and technical
    skills can help you to develop a strong foundation for working with data and machine
    learning effectively in your field or industry.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Individual skills in data literacy are important but it’s equally important
    to be able to communicate the data and findings to other people. Effective communication
    allows you to communicate insights and findings from data analysis in a clear,
    concise, and meaningful way. It involves not only presenting the data in a clear
    and understandable manner but also providing context and interpretation that can
    help the audience to understand the implications and potential uses of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Communication is also important for building trust and credibility with the
    audience. By presenting data in a clear and transparent manner, you can build
    trust and increase the likelihood that the audience will use the data to inform
    their decisions. Different audiences may have different levels of technical knowledge
    and they may be interested in different aspects of the data. By understanding
    the audience and tailoring the message to their needs, you can increase the effectiveness
    of your communication and ensure that the audience is able to understand and make
    use of the data and findings. In a machine learning context, it is crucial to
    create trust and provide clear communication about the possibilities and limitations
    of each solution.

    page as you, especially if they are involved in creating the machine-learning
    models or analyzing the results. Misunderstandings may lead to critical problems
    and business implications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To improve communication skills, there are several strategies that can be applied
    specifically to communicating about data. First and foremost, practice is key.
    The more you practice communicating about data, the more comfortable and confident
    you will become. It’s also important to know the audience and understand their
    level of knowledge, goals, and interests. Using plain language, providing context,
    and using visuals such as graphs and charts can make complex data easier to understand
    and more engaging.

    important to practice active listening and respond to feedback from the audience
    in a thoughtful and respectful manner. Seeking feedback from trusted colleagues,
    mentors, or advisors can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your
    communication skills over time.

    are crucial for eliminating errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in raw
    data and making it ready for analysis. Data analysis includes utilizing statistical
    methods, machine-learning algorithms, and other analytical techniques to recognize
    patterns, trends, and insights within data. Data visualization is the process
    of creating visual representations of data using graphs, charts, and other visualizations
    to make data more understandable and actionable.

    that are supported by evidence and grounded in a thorough understanding of the
    data. It involves the ability to identify relevant data, analyze it using appropriate
    tools and techniques, and draw conclusions that are based on evidence rather than
    assumptions or intuition. Informed decision-making is a critical skill for individuals
    who work with data, as it allows them to leverage data to drive better outcomes
    and make decisions that are backed by evidence.

    or question at hand, as well as the data that is relevant to it. You must be able
    to identify appropriate data sources, assess the quality of the data, and choose
    appropriate analytical techniques to analyze it. Informed decision-making also
    requires you to be able to interpret the results of your analysis and communicate
    findings effectively to others.
  prefs: []

    problems with machine learning. We will go through the steps required to create
    a good machine learning solution with the Qlik platform. We will cover how to
    define a problem and select a model, how to prepare the data, and what to consider
    when visualizing the end results.
