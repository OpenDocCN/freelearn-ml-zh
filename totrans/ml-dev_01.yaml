    learning didn''t appear from the void. As a discipline it has its predecessors,

  zh: 机器学习作为一个学科，不是一个孤立的领域——它被包含在一个更广泛的领域内，即**人工智能**（**AI**）。但正如你可以猜到的，机器学习并不是凭空出现的。作为一个学科，它有其前辈，并且它已经按照越来越复杂的阶段在以下四个明显区分的步骤中不断发展：
- en: The first model of machine learning involved rule-based decisions and a simple
    level of data-based algorithms that includes in itself, and as a prerequisite,
    all the possible ramifications and decision rules, implying that all the possible
    options will be hardcoded into the model beforehand by an expert in the field.
    This structure was implemented in the majority of applications developed since
    the first programming languages appeared in 1950\. The main data type and function
    being handled by this kind of algorithm is the Boolean, as it exclusively dealt
    with yes or no decisions.

  zh: 机器学习的第一个模型涉及基于规则的决策和基于数据算法的简单级别，它本身包括所有可能的后果和决策规则，作为先决条件，意味着所有可能的选项都将由该领域的专家事先硬编码到模型中。这种结构在1950年第一代编程语言出现以来的大多数应用中得到了实施。这类算法处理的主要数据类型和函数是布尔类型，因为它专门处理是或否的决策。
- en: During the second developmental stage of statistical reasoning, we started to
    let the probabilistic characteristics of the data have a say, in addition to the
    previous choices set up in advance. This better reflects the fuzzy nature of real-world
    problems, where outliers are common and where it is more important to take into
    account the nondeterministic tendencies of the data than the rigid approach of
    fixed questions. This discipline adds to the mix of mathematical tools elements
    of **Bayesian probability theory**. Methods pertaining to this category include
    curve fitting (usually of linear or polynomial), which has the common property
    of working with numerical data.

    generalize models from data but the models are capable of generating their own
    feature selectors, which aren't limited by a rigid target function, as they are
    generated and defined as the training process evolves. Another differentiator
    of this kind of model is that they can take a large variety of data types as input,
    such as speech, images, video, text, and other data susceptible to being represented
    as vectors.

- en: 'AI is the last step in the scale of abstraction capabilities that, in a way,
    include all previous algorithm types, but with one key difference: AI algorithms
    are able to apply the learned knowledge to solve tasks that had never been considered
    during training. The types of data with which this algorithm works are even more
    generic than the types of data supported by machine learning, and they should
    be able, by definition, to transfer problem-solving capabilities from one data
    type to another, without a complete retraining of the model. In this way, we could
    develop an algorithm for object detection in black and white images and the model
    could abstract the knowledge to apply the model to color images.'

    values depend on another function. This is the same as searching the rate of change
    of a function that is linked to a previous one. The chain rule is one of the main
    theoretical concepts employed in the training phase of neural networks, because
    in those layered structures, the output of the first neuron layers will be the
    inputs of the following, giving, as a result, a composite function that, most
    of the time, is of more than one nesting level.
