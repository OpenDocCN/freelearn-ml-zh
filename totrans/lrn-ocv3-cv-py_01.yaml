- en: You picked up this book so you may already have an idea of what OpenCV is. Maybe,
    you heard of Sci-Fi-sounding features, such as face detection, and got intrigued.
    If this is the case, you've made the perfect choice. **OpenCV** stands for **Open
    Source Computer Vision**. It is a free computer vision library that allows you
    to manipulate images and videos to accomplish a variety of tasks from displaying
    the feed of a webcam to potentially teaching a robot to recognize real-life objects.

    the Python programming language. Python is an elegant language with a relatively
    shallow learning curve and very powerful features. This chapter is a quick guide
    to setting up Python 2.7, OpenCV, and other related libraries. After setup, we
    also look at OpenCV's Python sample scripts and documentation.

    API (which is based on the C API). When looking up a class or function, be sure

    for the project described in this book. Depending on which approach we took, we
    might also have a set of tools and scripts that are usable to reconfigure and
