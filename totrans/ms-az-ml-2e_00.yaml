- en: During the last decade, **machine learning** (**ML**) has grown from a niche
    concept worked on in scientific circles to an enterprise-grade toolset that can
    be used to improve business processes and build intelligent products and services.
    The main reason is the constant increase in the volume of data being generated
    globally, requiring distributed systems, powerful algorithms, and scalable cloud
    infrastructure to compute insights. This book will help you improve your knowledge
    of ML concepts, find the right models for your use cases, and will give you the
    skillset to run machine learning models and build end-to-end ML pipelines in the
    Azure cloud.

- en: The book starts with an overview of every step in an end-to-end ML project and
    a guide on how to choose the right Azure service for different ML tasks. From
    there on out, it focuses on the Azure Machine Learning service and takes you through
    the important processes of data preparation and feature engineering. Following
    that, the book focuses on ML modeling techniques for different requirements, including
    advanced feature extraction techniques using **natural language processing** (**NLP**),
    classical ML techniques such as ensemble learning, and the secrets of both a great
    recommendation engine and a performant computer vision model using deep learning
    methods. In addition, the book explores how to train, optimize, and tune models
    using Azure automated machine learning and HyperDrive, and perform model training
    on distributed training clusters on Azure. Finally, the book covers the deployment
    of ML models to different target computes such as Azure Machine Learning clusters,
    Azure Kubernetes Service, and **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)**, along
    with the setup of MLOps pipelines with Azure DevOps.

    Machine Learning Process*, covers the history of ML, the scenarios in which to
    apply ML, the statistical knowledge necessary, and the steps and components required
    for running a custom end-to-end ML project. Its purpose is to bring every reader
    to the same foundational level. Due to that, some sections might be a recap for
    readers that are very knowledgeable about ML but still might hold some useful
    practical tips and guidelines for them. It is also designed to be the guide for
    the rest of the book, where every step in the ML process will point to the chapters
    covering them in detail.'

    for online scoring. To achieve that, we are going to package the model and execution
    runtime, register both in a model registry, and deploy them to an execution environment.

    operation. This includes the creation of environments; starting, stopping, and
    scaling clusters; submitting experiments; performing parameter optimization; and
    deploying full-fledged scoring services on Kubernetes. We will reuse all the concepts

    the importance of a clean base infrastructure, monitoring, and automation and
    discuss the ever-changing nature of ML and cloud-based services. Finally, we cover
    one of the most important topics, which we glanced over throughout the book, ethics
    in data processing. We will discuss your responsibility to have fair and explainable
    ML models and how Azure Machine Learning and open source tooling can help you

    Machine Learning workspace (typically a `Standard_DS3_v2` virtual machine), which
    gives you access to a Jupyter environment and all essential libraries preinstalled,
    or you can run it on your own local machine. To do so, you need a Python runtime
    with the Jupyter package installed and some additional libraries, which will be
    mentioned in the technical requirements of each chapter. We tested all the code
    with Python version 3.8 and the Azure ML Python SDK version 1.34.0 at the time
    of writing. If you want to work with a different setup, be sure to check the supported
