    Recommendation Engines such as collaborative filtering, content based recommendation
    engines, context aware recommendation engines using R, Python, Spark, Mahout,
    Neo4j technologies. The book covers various recommendation engines widely used
    across industries with their implementations. This book also covers a chapter
    on popular datamining techniques commonly used in building recommendations and
    also discuss in brief about the future of recommendation engines at the end of
    the book.'
