- en: This section focuses on advanced machine learning concepts and how they can
    be implemented using OpenCV and scikit-learn. We will cover some advanced machine
    learning concepts, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and Bayesian
    learning, and then finally move on to discuss the second type of machine learning
    problems—unsupervised learning.
