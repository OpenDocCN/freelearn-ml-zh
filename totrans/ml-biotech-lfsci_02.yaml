    over my last few years as a data scientist and consultant operating in the technology/biotechnology
    sectors, and the answer to this question never really seemed to change from person
    to person. My recommendation was generally along the lines of learning **Python**
    and **data science** through online courses and following a few tutorials to get
    a sense of how things worked. What I found was that the vast majority of scientists
    and engineers that I have encountered, who are interested in learning data science,
    tend to get overwhelmed by the large volume of resources and documentation available
    on the internet. From *Getting Started in Python* courses to *Comprehensive Machine
    Learning* guides, the vast majority of those who ask the question *How do I get
    started?* often find themselves confused and demotivated just a few days into
    their journey. This is especially true for scientists or researchers in the lab
    who do not usually interact with code, algorithms, or predictive models. Using
    the Terminal command line for the first time can be unusual, uncomfortable, and
    – to a certain extent – terrifying to a new user.'

- en: This book exists to address this problem. This is a one-stop shop to give **scientists**,
    **engineers**, and everyone in-between a fast and efficient guide to getting started
    in the beautiful field of data science. If you are not a coder and do not intend
    to be, you have the option to read this book from cover to cover without ever
    using Python or any of the hands-on resources. You will still manage to walk away
    with a strong foundation and understanding of machine learning and its useful
    capabilities, and what it can bring to the table within your team. If you are
    a coder, you have the option to follow along on your personal computer and complete
    all the tutorials we will cover. All of the code within this book is inclusive,
    connected, and designed to be fully replicable on your device. In addition, all
    of the code in this book and its associated tutorials is available online for
    your convenience. The tutorials we will complete can be thought of as blueprints
    to a certain extent, in the sense that they can be recycled and applied to your
    data. So, depending on what your expectations of the phrase *getting started*
    are, you will be able to use this book effectively and efficiently, regardless
    of your intent to code. So, how do we plan on getting started?

    problems and use cases that are commonly experienced in the technology and biotechnology
    sectors. Unlike many of the courses and tutorials available online, this book
    is well-connected, condensed, and chronological, thus offering you a fast and
    efficient way to get up to speed on data science. In under 400 pages, we will
    introduce the main concepts and ideas relating to Python, SQL, machine learning,
    deep learning, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. We will
    cover some popular approaches, best practices, and important information every
    data scientist should know. In addition to all of this, we will not only put on
    our data scientist hats to train and develop several powerful predictive models,
    but we will also put on our data engineer hats and deploy our models to the cloud
    using **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) and **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**).
    Whether you are planning to bring data science to your current team, train and
    deploy the models yourself, or start interviewing for data scientist positions,
    this book will equip you with the right tools and resources to start your new
    journey, starting with this first chapter. In the following sections, we will
    cover a few interesting topics to get us started:'

    areas where machine learning can be applied – the only limitation is the existence
    of data to support the development of a new model. Within the scope of **science
    and innovation**, there have been significant advances when it comes to predicting
    molecular properties, generating molecular structures to suit specific therapeutic
    targets, and even sequencing genes for advanced diagnostics. In each of these
    examples, AI has been – and continues to be – useful in aiding and accelerating
    the research and development of new and novel products. Within the scope of **business
    and operations**, there are many examples of AI being used to improve processes
    such as intelligently manufacturing materials to reduce waste, natural language
    processing to extract insights from scientific literature, or even demand forecasting
    to improve supply chain processes. In each of these examples, AI has been crucial
    in reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Finally, when it comes to **patients
    and health**, AI has proven to be pivotal when it comes to recruiting people for
    and shaping clinical trials, developing recommendation engines designed to avoid
    drug interactions, or even faster diagnoses, given a patient's symptoms. In each
    of these applications, data was obtained, used to generate a model, and then validated.

    To have a working version of Python and its associated libraries on your computer
    as quickly as possible, using Anaconda is highly recommended. In addition to Python,
    we will need to install libraries to assist in a few areas. Think of libraries
    as nicely packaged portions of code that we can import and use as we see fit.
    Anaconda will, by default, install a few important libraries for us, but there
    will be others that we will need. We can install those on-the-go using pip. We
    will look at this in more detail in the next chapter. For the time being, go ahead
    and install Anaconda on your computer by navigating to the aforementioned website,
    downloading the installation that best matches your machine, and following the
