    In the original ICPC, small teams from universities and companies participated
    in a competition that required solving a series of problems using a computer program

    would give a film, solely based on the ratings that they gave other films, without
    knowing specifically who the user was or what the films were. Since no user description
    or movie title or description were available (all being replaced with identity
    codes), the competition required entrants to develop smart ways to use the past
    ratings available. The grand prize of US $1,000,000 was to be awarded only if
    the solution could improve the existing Netflix algorithm, Cinematch, above a
    certain threshold.

    Kaggle competitions; two researchers from AT&T Labs; and two others from Yahoo!.
    In the end, winning the competition required so much computational power and the
    ensembling of different solutions that teams were forced to merge in order to
    keep pace. This situation was also reflected in the actual usage of the solution
    by Netflix, who preferred not to implement it, but simply took the most interesting
    insight from it in order to improve its existing Cinematch algorithm. You can

    an Australian trained economist with a degree in Economics and Econometrics. After
    working at Australia’s Department of the Treasury and the Research department
    at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Goldbloom interned in London at The Economist,
    the international weekly newspaper on current affairs, international business,
    politics, and technology. At The Economist, he had occasion to write an article
    about big data, which inspired his idea to build a competition platform that could
    crowdsource the best analytical experts to solve interesting machine learning
    problems ([https://www.smh.com.au/technology/from-bondi-to-the-big-bucks-the-28yearold-whos-making-data-science-a-sport-20111104-1myq1.html](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/from-bondi-to-the-big-bucks-the-28yearold-whos-making-data-science-a-sport-20111104-1myq1.html)).
    Since the crowdsourcing dynamics played a relevant part in the business idea for
    this platform, he derived the name *Kaggle*, which recalls by rhyme the term *gaggle*,
    a flock of geese, the goose also being the symbol of the platform.

- en: There are examples of Featured competitions every time you visit Kaggle. At
    the moment, many of them are problems relating to the application of deep learning
    methods to unstructured data like text, images, videos, or sound. In the past,
    tabular data competitions were commonly seen, that is, competitions based on problems
    relating to structured data that can be found in a database. First by using random
    forests, then gradient boosting methods with clever feature engineering, tabular
    data solutions derived from Kaggle could really improve an existing solution.
    Nowadays, these competitions are run much less often, because a crowdsourced solution
    won’t often be much better than what a good team of data scientists or even AutoML
    software can do. Given the spread of better software and good practices, the increase
    in result quality obtainable from competitions is indeed marginal. In the unstructured
    data world, however, a good deep learning solution could still make a big difference.
    For instance, pre-trained networks such as BERT brought about double-digit increases
    in previous standards for many well-known NLP task benchmarks.

    finished and only to the participants of the first part. The two-stage competition
    format has emerged in order to limit the chance of some competitors cheating and
    infringing the rules, since the evaluation is done on a completely untried test
    set that is available for a short time only. Contrary to the original Kaggle competition

- en: The system works the best if the task is well defined and the data is of good
    quality. In the long run, the performance of solutions improves by small gains
    until it reaches an asymptote. The process can be sped up by allowing a certain
    amount of sharing among participants (as happens on Kaggle by means of discussions,
    and sharing Kaggle Notebooks and extra data provided by the datasets found in
    the Datasets section). According to the CTF paradigm, competitive pressure in
    a competition suffices to produce always-improving solutions. When the competitive
    pressure is paired with some degree of sharing among participants, the improvement
    happens at an even faster rate – hence why Kaggle introduced many incentives for
    sharing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果任务定义得很好且数据质量良好，系统工作得最好。从长远来看，解决方案的性能通过小的增益逐渐提高，直到达到一个渐近线。通过允许参与者之间进行一定程度的共享（如在Kaggle上通过讨论和共享Kaggle
    Notebooks以及数据集部分中找到的额外数据）可以加快这个过程。根据CTF范式，竞赛中的竞争压力足以产生不断改进的解决方案。当竞争压力与参与者之间的一定程度的共享相结合时，改进的速度会更快——这就是为什么Kaggle引入了许多共享激励措施的原因。
- en: 'This is because the **secret sauce** in the CTF paradigm is the competition
    itself, which, within the framework of a practical problem whose empirical performance
    has to be improved, always leads to the emergence of new benchmarks, new data
    and modeling solutions, and in general to an improved application of machine learning
    to the problem posed by the competition. A competition can therefore provide a
    new way to solve a prediction problem, new ways of feature engineering, and new
    algorithmic or modeling solutions. For instance, deep learning did not simply
    emerge from academic research, but it first gained a great boost because of successful
    competitions that signaled its efficacy (we have already mentioned, for instance,
    the Merck competition, won by *Geoffrey Hinton’s* team: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners)).'

  zh: 这是因为在CTF范式中的**秘密配方**就是竞赛本身，在解决一个需要提高经验性能的实际问题的框架内，它总是导致新的基准、新的数据和建模解决方案的出现，总的来说，是提高了机器学习在竞赛提出的问题上的应用。因此，一个竞赛可以提供一种解决预测问题的新方法，新的特征工程方法，以及新的算法或建模解决方案。例如，深度学习并非仅仅源于学术研究，它首先因为成功的竞赛而获得了巨大的推动力，这些竞赛标志着其有效性（例如，我们已经提到了*杰弗里·辛顿*的团队赢得的默克竞赛：[https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners))。
- en: Coupled with the open software movement, which allows everyone access to powerful
    analytical tools (such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch), the CTF paradigm
    brings about even better results because all competitors are on the same level
    at the start. On the other hand, the reliance of a solution to a competition on
    specialized or improved hardware can limit achievable results, because it can
    prevent competitors without access to such resources from properly participating
    and contributing directly to the solution, or indirectly by exercising competitive
    pressure on the other participants. Understandably, this is the reason why Kaggle
    started offering cloud services free to participants of its competitions, the
    Kaggle Notebooks we will introduce in the *Computational resources* section. It
    can flatten some differences in hardware-intense competitions (as most deep learning
    ones are) and increase the overall competitive pressure.

    In this situation, you can take advantage of the evaluation metrics shown to you

    clear example of this happened in the competition *Don’t Overfit II*. The winning

- en: Another form of leaderboard snooping (that is, getting a hint about the test
    set and overfitting to it) happens when participants rely more on the feedback

    complete failure of the competition, causing a wild shake-up – a complete and
    unpredictable reshuffling of the positions on the final leaderboard. The winning
    solutions, in such a case, may turn out to be not so optimal for the problem or
    even just dictated by chance. This has led to the diffusion of techniques analyzing
    the potential gap between the training set and the public test set. This kind
    of analysis, called **adversarial testing**, can provide insight about how much

    selected Kaggle participants in exchange for brand visibility. For instance, a
    Z8 machine has up to 72 cores, 3 TB of memory, 48 TB of storage (a good share
    by solid storage hard drive standards), and usually dual NVIDIA RTX as the GPU.
    We understand that this may be a bit out of reach for many; even renting a similar

    make the real difference in a Kaggle competition. For a competition to be handled
    successfully, it sometimes requires the collaborative efforts of a team of contestants.
    Apart from Recruitment competitions, where the sponsor may require individual
    participants for a better evaluation of their abilities, there is typically no
    restriction against forming teams. Usually, teams can be made up of a maximum
    of five contestants.

    solution. A team can spend more time on the problem together and different skills

    same level of skill when it comes to different models and data manipulation.

    efforts toward a common goal may prove not so easy, and some suboptimal situations
    may arise. A common problem is when some of the participants are not involved
    or are simply idle, but no doubt the worst is when someone infringes the rules
    of the competition – to the detriment of everyone, since the whole team could
    be disqualified – or even spies on the team in order to give an advantage to another
    team, as we mentioned earlier.

    to achieve more, since Kaggle rules do reward teams over lonely competitors. In
    fact, for smaller teams you get a percentage of the total that is higher than
    an equal share. Teaming up is not the only possibility for networking in Kaggle,
    though it is certainly more profitable and interesting for the participants. You
    can also network with others through discussions on the forums, or by sharing
    Datasets and Notebooks during competitions. All these opportunities on the platform

    I had a bunch of complicated models including neural networks, but also some other

    one architecture which was very optimized (number of epochs, learning rate). Another
    aspect of this competition that was quite unique was that it wasn’t enough to

    the skills they use to compete that are, in truth, quite rare in the general population).
    The monetary prizes usually cover the efforts of the top few Kagglers, if not

    not have an automatic value beyond the Kaggle community. For instance, in a job

    data and problems and effective model testing. It can also expose you to many
    techniques and different data/business problems, beyond your actual experience

    useful throughout your career and will provide you a hedge when you have to solve
    complex and unusual problems with data modeling; by participating in Kaggle competitions,
    you build up strong competencies in modeling and validating. You also network
    with other data scientists, which can get you a reference for a job more easily
    and provide you with another way to handle difficult problems beyond your skills,
    because you will have access to other people’s competencies and opinions.
