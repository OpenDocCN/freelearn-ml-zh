- en: Applied **machine learning** (**ML**) and **high-performance computing** (**HPC**)
    have been integral to tackling the world’s most complex problems, including genomics,
    autonomous vehicles, computational fluid dynamics, and numerical optimization.
    Due to the high computing power required for these applications, HPC was once
    only used by large organizations that could afford it. Now, it is available for
    use by everyone, from individual research groups to start-ups and big enterprises,
    using **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) cloud technology.

    with practical examples. You will begin by exploring virtually unlimited infrastructure
    and fast networking for scalable HPC on AWS, including an overview of the relevant
    tools and technologies. You’ll learn how to develop large-scale ML applications
    using HPC on AWS, you will understand the various architectural components, and
    you’ll learn about performance optimization, with hands-on application to real-world
    use cases in various domains.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18493_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *High-Performance Computing
    Fundamentals*, introduces the concepts of HPC, highlighting the importance of
    HPC as it relates to real-world scenarios. We then talk about technological advancements
    in HPC and how you can use it to solve complex business problems with unlimited
    capacity, the most advanced computing capabilities, and the elasticity of the
    cloud, while still optimizing cost, to innovate faster and gain a competitive
    business advantage.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18493_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035), *Data Management and Transfer*,
    dives into data management and transfer. The first step to running HPC applications
    on the cloud is to move the required data to the cloud. Therefore, this chapter
    focuses on different aspects of data migration, including challenges and key pain
    points businesses might face, and how AWS data migration services can help resolve
    them, following the best practices and still maintaining data integrity, consistency
    and security.'

    explains how once you have the data in the cloud, you need to understand the compute
    options provided by AWS as well as their differences, in order to optimally select
    the right option based on your business requirements. Furthermore, to scale and
    secure your HPC applications, we then dive into the Networking section, to explain
    the concepts of private VPC, low latency networking, and optimizing the performance
    of inter-instance communications.'
