- en: Open source computer vision projects, such as OpenCV 3, enable all kinds of
    users to harness the forces of machine vision, machine learning, and artificial
    intelligence. By mastering these powerful libraries of code and knowledge, professionals
    and hobbyists can create smarter, better applications wherever they are needed.

- en: As a basic setup, the complete book is based on the OpenCV 3 software. If a
    chapter does not have a specific OS requirement, then it will run on Windows,
    Linux, and Mac. As authors, we encourage you to take the latest master branch
    from the official GitHub repository ([https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/))
    for setting up your OpenCV installation, rather then using the downloadable packages
    at the official OpenCV website ([http://opencv.org/downloads.html](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)),
    since the latest master branch contains a huge number of fixes compared to the
    latest stable release.

- en: As authors, we acknowledge that installing OpenCV 3 on your system can sometimes
    be quite cumbersome. Therefore, we have added a series of basic installation guides
    for installing OpenCV 3, based on the latest OpenCV 3 master branch on your system,
    and getting the necessary modules for the different chapters to work. For more
    information, take a look at [https://github.com/OpenCVBlueprints/OpenCVBlueprints/tree/master/installation_tutorials](https://github.com/OpenCVBlueprints/OpenCVBlueprints/tree/master/installation_tutorials).

- en: Keep in mind that the book also uses modules from the OpenCV "contrib" (contributed)
    repository. The installation manual will have directions on how to install these.
    However, we encourage you to only install those modules that we need, because
    we know that they are stable. For other modules, this might not be the case.

    is an advanced book, intended for those who already have some experience in setting
    up an OpenCV development environment and building applications with OpenCV. You
    should be comfortable with computer vision concepts, object-oriented programming,
    graphics programming, IDEs, and the command line.
