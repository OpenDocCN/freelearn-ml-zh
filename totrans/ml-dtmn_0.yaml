- en: 30% of data mining vacancies also involve machine learning. And those that do
    are 30% better paid than the rest. If you’re involved in data mining, you need
    to get on top of machine learning, before it gets on top of you.

- en: '*Hands-On Machine Learning for Data Mining* gives you everything you need to
    bring the power of machine learning into your data mining work. This book will
    enable you to pair the best algorithms with the right tools and processes. You
    will see how systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions
    on data, all with minimal human intervention.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](89b0379e-6284-4901-bac1-4599ccd4a962.xhtml), *Introducing Machine
    Learning Predictive Models*, introduces you to the theory behind predictive models,
    looking at how they work and providing an insight into types of predictive modeling,
    such as the neural network model, which is explained in brief in this chapter.'

    Machine Learning*, introduces you to the implementation of a neural network model,
    and gives an insight into the implementation of **Support Vector Machines** (**SVMs**)
    as well.'

    explains different types of models and the situations in which each of them should
    ideally be used.'

    Models*, shows you different ways in which we can improve our models. This chapter
    will show you four methods to improve the accuracy of your model.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](7f27395b-6acf-420e-8c70-daf04bdcf536.xhtml), *Advanced Ways of
    Improving Models*, focuses on combining different models in different ways to
    get increasingly better results. In this chapter, we will see how a certain part
    of a dataset, which doesn''t contribute much to the results of a neural network
    model, performs very well on the CHAID and C5.0 decision tree models. We will
    also see how to model the errors to prepare our models.'
