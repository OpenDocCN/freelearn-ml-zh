- en: There are many notable books on machine learning, from pedagogical tracts on
    the theory of learning from data; to standard references on specializations in
    the field, such as clustering and outlier detection or probabilistic graph modeling;
    to cookbooks that offer practical advice on the use of tools and libraries in
    a particular language. The books that tend to be broad in coverage are often short
    on theoretical detail, while those with a focus on one topic or tool may not,
    for example, have much to say about the difference in approach in a streaming
    as opposed to a batch environment. Besides, for the non-novices with a preference
    for tools in Java who wish to reach for a single volume that will extend their
    knowledge—simultaneously, on the essential aspects—there are precious few options.

    a balance between treatment of theory and practice with the aid of probability,
    statistics, basic linear algebra, and rudimentary calculus in the service of one,
    and emphasizing methodology, case studies, tools and code in support of the other.

    highest share in popularity among languages used in machine learning, after Python.
    What''s more is that this marks a 19% increase from the year before! Clearly,
    Java remains an important and effective vehicle to build and deploy systems involving
    machine learning, despite claims of its decline in some quarters. With this book,
    we aim to reach professionals and motivated enthusiasts with some experience in
    Java and a beginner''s knowledge of machine learning. Our goal is to make *Mastering
    Java Machine Learning* the next step on their path to becoming advanced practitioners
    in data science. To guide them on this path, the book covers a veritable arsenal
    of techniques in machine learning—some which they may already be familiar with,
    others perhaps not as much, or only superficially—including methods of data analysis,
    learning algorithms, evaluation of model performance, and more in supervised and
    semi-supervised learning, clustering and anomaly detection, and semi-supervised
    and active learning. It also presents special topics such as probabilistic graph
    modeling, text mining, and deep learning. Not forgetting the increasingly important
    topics in enterprise-scale systems today, the book also covers the unique challenges
    of learning from evolving data streams and the tools and techniques applicable
    to real-time systems, as well as the imperatives of the world of Big Data:'

    domains with the right methodology, processes, applications, and analysis. Accompanying
    each chapter are case studies and examples of how to apply the newly learned techniques
    using some of the best available open source tools written in Java. This book
    covers more than 15 open source Java tools supporting a wide range of techniques
    between them, with code and practical usage. The code, data, and configurations
    are available for readers to download and experiment with. We present more than
    ten real-world case studies in Machine Learning that illustrate the data scientist''s
    process. Each case study details the steps undertaken in the experiments: data
    ingestion, data analysis, data cleansing, feature reduction/selection, mapping
    to machine learning, model training, model selection, model evaluation, and analysis
    of results. This gives the reader a practical guide to using the tools and methods
    presented in each chapter for solving the business problem at hand.'

    understanding of machine learning concepts. If that doesn''t apply to you, but
    you are curious nonetheless and self-motivated, fret not, and read on! For those
    who do have some background, it means that you are familiar with simple statistical
    analysis of data and concepts involved in supervised and unsupervised learning.
    Those who may not have the requisite math or must poke the far reaches of their
    memory to shake loose the odd formula or funny symbol, do not be disheartened.
    If you are the sort that loves a challenge, the short primer in the appendices
    may be all you need to kick-start your engines—a bit of tenacity will see you
    through the rest! For those who have never been introduced to machine learning,
    the first chapter was equally written for you as for those needing a refresher—it
    is your starter-kit to jump in feet first and find out what it''s all about. You
    can augment your basics with any number of online resources. Finally, for those
    innocent of Java, here''s a secret: many of the tools featured in the book have
    powerful GUIs. Some include wizard-like interfaces, making them quite easy to
    use, and do not require any knowledge of Java. So if you are new to Java, just
    skip the examples that need coding and learn to use the GUI-based tools instead!'

    responsibilities may include data analysis, data visualization or transformation,
    the training, validation, testing and evaluation of machine learning models—presumably
    to perform predictive, descriptive or prescriptive analytics using Java or Java-based
    tools. The choice of Java may imply a personal preference and therefore some prior
    experience programming in Java. On the other hand, perhaps circumstances in the
    work environment or company policies limit the use of third-party tools to only
    those written in Java and a few others. In the second case, the prospective reader
    may have no programming experience in Java. This book is aimed at this reader
    just as squarely as it is at their colleague, the Java expert (who came up with
    the policy in the first place).

    an intellectual curiosity about machine learning and the desire for a single comprehensive
    treatment of the concepts, the practical techniques, and the tools. A specimen
    of this type of reader can opt to skip the math and the tools and focus on learning
    the most common supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms alone. Another
    might skim over *Chapters 1, 2, 3,* and *7,* skip the others entirely, and jump
    headlong into the tools—a perfectly reasonable strategy if you want to quickly
    make yourself useful analyzing that dataset the client said would be here any
    day now. Importantly, too, with some practice reproducing the experiments from
    the book, it''ll get you asking the right questions of the gurus! Alternatively,
    you might want to use this book as a reference to quickly look up the details
    of the algorithm for affinity propagation ([Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Unsupervised
    Machine Learning Techniques"), *Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques*), or
    remind yourself of an LSTM architecture with a brief review of the schematic ([Chapter
