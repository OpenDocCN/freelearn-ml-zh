			<p>Since machine learning is based on patterns in the training data, we need to understand how to work with this kind of system from an ethical perspective. Ethics is one of these areas that software engineers are not the most familiar with. In this part of the book, we look into what kind of ethical issues exist in data acquisition and management and how to work with bias in machine learning algorithms. Finally, we finish up this part by exploring how to integrate what weâ€™ve learned in this book into an entire ecosystem of web services and how to <span class="No-Break">deploy them.</span></p>
			<p>This part has the <span class="No-Break">following chapters:</span></p>
