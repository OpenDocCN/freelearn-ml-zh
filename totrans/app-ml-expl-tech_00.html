This chapter covers various terminology and concepts related to explainability techniques, which is frequently used throughout this book. This chapter also covers the key criteria of human-friendly explainable ML systems and different approaches to evaluating the quality of the explainability techniques.</p>
			<p><a href="B18216_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor033"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Model Explainability Methods,</em> discusses the various model explainability methods used for explaining black-box models. Some of these are model agnostic, some are model specific. Some of these methods provide global interpretability while others provide local interpretability. This chapter will introduce you to a variety of techniques that can be used for explaining ML models and provides recommendation for the right choice of explainability method.</p>
			<p><a href="B18216_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Data-Centric Approaches,</em> introduces the concept of data-centric XAI. This chapter covers various techniques to explain the working of ML systems in terms of the properties of the data, data volume, data consistency, data purity and actionable insights generated from the underlying training dataset.</p>
			<p><a href="B18216_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">LIME for Model Interpretability</em>, covers the application of one of the most popular XAI frameworks, called LIME. This chapter discusses about the intuition behind the working of the LIME algorithm and some important properties of the algorithm which makes the generated explanations human-friendly. Certain advantages and limitations of the LIME algorithm are also discussed in this chapter, along with a code tutorial for applying LIME for a classification problem.</p>

			<p>To run the code tutorials provided in this book, you will need a Jupyter environment with Python 3.6+. This can be achieved in either of the following ways: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Install one on your machine locally via <strong class="bold">Anaconda Navigator</strong> or from scratch with <strong class="bold">pip</strong>. </li>
				<li>Use a cloud-based environment such as <strong class="bold">Google Colaboratory</strong>, <strong class="bold">Kaggle notebooks</strong>, <strong class="bold">Azure notebooks</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Amazon SageMaker</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can take a look at the supplementary information provided at the code repository if you are new to Jupyter notebooks: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Applied-Machine-Learning-Explainability-Techniques/blob/main/SupplementaryInfo/CodeSetup.md">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Applied-Machine-Learning-Explainability-Techniques/blob/main/SupplementaryInfo/CodeSetup.md</a>.</p>

			<p>For instructions on installing the Python packages used throughout the book, please refer the specific notebook provided in the code repository. For any additional help needed, please refer the original project repository of the specific package. You can use <strong class="bold">PyPi</strong> (<a href="https://pypi.org/">https://pypi.org/</a>) and search for the specific package and navigate to the code repository of the project. It is expected that installation or execution instructions of these packages can change from time to time, given how often packages change. We also tested the code with specific versions detailed in the <em class="italic">Python package information README file</em> under the supplementary information provided at the code repository. So, if anything doesn't work as expected with the later versions, please install the specific version mentioned in the README instead.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book's GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</strong></p>
			<p>For beginners without any exposure to ML or data science, it is recommended to read the book sequentially as many important concepts are explained in sufficient detail in the earlier chapters. Seasoned ML or data science experts who are relatively new to the field of XAI can skim through the first three chapters to get clear conceptual understanding of various terminology used. For chapters four to nine, any order should be fine for seasoned experts. For all level of practitioners, it is recommended that you read chapter 10 and 11 only after covering all the nine chapters. </p>
			<p>Regarding the code provided, it is recommended that you either read each chapter and then run the corresponding code, or you can run the code simultaneously while reading the specific chapters. Sufficient theory is also added in the Jupyter notebooks to help you understand the overall flow of the notebook.</p>
			<p>When you are reading the book, it is recommended that you take notes of the important terminologies covered and try to think of ways in which you could apply the concept or the framework learned. After reading the book and going through all the Jupyter notebooks, hopefully, you will be inspired to apply the newly gained knowledge into action!</p>
