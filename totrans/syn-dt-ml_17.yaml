    with synthetic data. We will highlight again the main problems with real-data-based
    ML solutions. Then, we will recap the benefits of synthetic data-based solutions,
    challenges, and limitations. Finally, we will highlight some interesting future
    perspectives.

    annotated data ([*Chapter 1*](B18494_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014)). Then, we delved
    into the main issues with real data, and we thoroughly analyzed the key drawbacks
    of the annotation process ([*Chapter 2*](B18494_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034)). After
    that, we discussed and learned why privacy hinders ML progress in certain domains,
    such as finance and healthcare ([*Chapter 3*](B18494_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049)).

    problems (*Chapters 4* and *5*). Following this, we explored various well-known
    approaches to generating synthetic data (*Part 3*). We delved into utilizing simulators
    and game engines to generate synthetic data ([*Chapter 6*](B18494_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099)).
    Then, we explored GANs in detail ([*Chapter 7*](B18494_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120)).
    Later, in our exploration of a novel synthetic data generation approach, we uncovered
    valuable insights about utilizing video games as a source of synthetic data ([*Chapter
    8*](B18494_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138)). Finally, we extensively studied diffusion
    models and explored their diverse applications for synthetic data generation ([*Chapter
    9*](B18494_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154)).

    real-life scenarios, by providing diverse real-world examples of the successful
    utilization of synthetic data in computer vision ([*Chapter 10*](B18494_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178)),
    natural language processing ([*Chapter 11*](B18494_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor188)),
    and predictive analytics ([*Chapter 12*](B18494_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203)). Then,
    we learned about some well-known domain-specific issues that limit the usability
    of synthetic data and uncovered some best practices to effectively utilize synthetic
    data in practice ([*Chapter 13*](B18494_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216)).

- en: To ensure that you are aware of common issues that usually hinder the effective
    utilization of synthetic data, we comprehensively explored synthetic-to-real domain
    adaptation approaches. We thoroughly studied the domain gap problem in ML and
    learned about the main approaches for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation ([*Chapter
    14*](B18494_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor230)). Then, we learned why diverse data is
    essential in ML and discovered the main strategies to generate diverse synthetic
    datasets. Following this, we highlighted the main issues and challenges of generating
    diverse synthetic data ([*Chapter 15*](B18494_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor247)). After
    that, we learned why generating photorealistic data is pivotal in computer vision.
    We also learned about the main approaches to enhancing photorealism and discussed
    the essential photorealism evaluation metrics. Then, we covered the challenges
    and limitations of generating photorealistic synthetic data in practice ([*Chapter
    16*](B18494_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor269)).

    to unlock new opportunities and possibilities in the field of ML. I highly encourage
    you to join synthetic data communities, such as the Mostly AI synthetic data community
    on Discord ([https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-discord-community](https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-discord-community))
    and the Open Community for the Creation and Use of Synthetic Data in AI ([https://opensynthetics.com](https://opensynthetics.com)).
    You can always explore synthetic data generation tools, such as Synthesized ([https://www.synthesized.io](https://www.synthesized.io)),
    Gretel.ai ([https://gretel.ai](https://gretel.ai)) and Neurolabs ([https://www.neurolabs.ai](https://www.neurolabs.ai)).

    cheaper, and easier to generate and utilize. Governments and decision-makers are
    aware of the huge advantages of synthetic data. Many governments, including the
    American government, have a clear plan to advance **Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing
    and Analytics** (**PPDSA**) methods ([https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf)).
    As expected, synthetic data is central to these solutions. Thus, even more research,
    attention, and funding will be given to synthetic data in the near future.

- en: In this chapter, we provided a brief overview of what is covered in this book.
    First, we discussed the need for real data and the main problems usually associated
    with collecting and annotating large-scale real datasets. Then, we saw that synthetic
    data presents a clever solution that elegantly mitigates most of these problems
    and issues. Second, we mastered the main approaches to generating diverse and
    realistic synthetic data. Third, we explored various case studies and learned
    about the main issues and limitations of synthetic-data-based ML solutions.
