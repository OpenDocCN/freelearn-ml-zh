    of **Explainable AI** (**XAI**), covering different types of explainability methods
    used in practice for different dimensions of explainability (*data*, *model*,
    *outcome*, and the *end users*). XAI is an active field of research that I think
    is yet to reach its full potential. But the field is growing rapidly, along with
    the broader domain of AI, and we will witness many new algorithms, approaches,
    and tools being developed in the future. Most likely, the new methods and tools
    of XAI will be better than the existing ones and will be able to tackle some of
    the *open challenges of XAI* discussed in [*Chapter 10*](B18216_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209),
    *XAI Industry Best Practices*. Unfortunately, we cannot extend the scope of this
    book to cover all possible approaches to XAI. However, the goal of this book is
    to provide a blend of conceptual understanding of the field with the required
    practical skills so that it is a useful starting point for beginners, and even
    add to the knowledge of experts for an applied knowledge of XAI.

    an explainable **Machine Learning** (**ML**) system from the industry perspective.
    We also discussed the existing challenges of XAI and some recommended ways to
    mitigate the challenges. Considering these existing challenges, in this chapter,
    we will focus on the ideology of **End User-Centered Artificial Intelligence**
    (**ENDURANCE**). This is a term that is often used to refer to sustainable and
    scalable AI solutions that are built, keeping the user in the center. It is recommended
    that you read the previous chapter before starting this chapter for a better understanding.
    ENDURANCE is neither a new algorithm nor a new, sophisticated tool for XAI. Instead,
    it is a practice; it is a methodical discipline to bridge the AI-end user gaps.

    developers and thought leaders, this chapter will help you to design your AI solutions
    keeping the end user in the center and promoting AI adoption.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For most industrial problems, AI solutions are developed in isolation and users
    are only introduced in the final stages of the development process after a minimum
    viable solution is ready. With this conventional approach, it is often found that
    product leads or product managers tend to focus on projecting the solution from
    the development team's perspective to meet the goals of the users. Well, this
    approach is absolutely fine, and it might work really well for certain use cases
    that require the technical team to develop through abstraction. However, if the
    users are not involved in the early stages of the implementation process, it has
    been often found that the users are reluctant to adopt the solution. So, the ENDURANCE
    ideology is focused on developing solutions by involving final users right from
    the design phase of the solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ENDURANCE ideology focuses on the principles of HCI and emphasizes the importance
    of *distributed cognition* of the user. With this ideology, the entire solution
    comprising the **User Interface** (**UI**), *AI algorithms*, *underlying dataset*,
    *XAI component*, and *end user's experience* is considered collectively as a *system*,
    rather than considering the individual components in isolation. This ensures that
    explainability is baked into the system instead of being offered as an add-on
    service for the user. From what I have observed, most industrial AI solutions
    are developed in isolation as a separate component and then added to the main
    software system as an *add-on* or *premium feature*. Similarly, the XAI component
    is also considered an add-on feature after being developed in isolation. Consequently,
    the seamless UX can get hampered, and the main benefits of the AI solution and
    the XAI component may not be realized to their full potential. This is why we
    should focus on the design and development of the entire user-centric XAI/ML system.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary questions that the field of HCI tries to address are *Who are the
    users?* and *What are their needs?* Or in other words, it tries to understand
    the *goal relevance* of the solution for the user. If the solution provided is
    not effectively solving the problem by meeting the needs of the users without
    introducing other challenges, it is not relevant. Not considering the goal relevance
    is probably one of the main reasons why the majority of AI solutions are either
    scrapped or adopted with a lot of skepticism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The recommended approach to evaluate goal relevance is by checking whether the
    users can achieve their goals without the introduction of other challenges. Along
    with goal relevance, I often recommend assessing the impact of the solution. The
    impact of the solution can be qualitatively measured by taking the user's feedback
    when the solution is absent.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As discussed before, in most industrial use cases, XAI is used in isolation
    to provide explainability without considering the user needs. Instead, using the
    ideology of ENDURANCE, XAI should connect the user needs with the strength of
    the AI algorithm. Once the user needs are identified, *translate the user needs
    into data needs and model needs*. If the underlying dataset is not sufficient
    to meet all the user needs, use **data-centric XAI** to communicate the limitations
    of the dataset to the user. If the model needs are identified, use XAI to interpret
    the working of the model, and tune accordingly to meet the needs of the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this process can be challenging as it involves identifying the existing
    *mental model* of the user. With the introduction of AI and XAI, the existing
    workflow should not get disrupted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, it is also recommended that using XAI, you try to explain whether
    the AI solution is adding any unique value. But design the explainability methods
    to justify the advantages and not the underlying technology used. For example,
    if the system conveys to the user that complex deep learning algorithms are used
    to predict the outcome, it does not increase the confidence of the user. Instead,
    if the system conveys that the intelligent solution helps the user to reach their
    goal five times faster than the conventional approach, the user will agree to
    adopt the solution.

    on developing accurate AI models giving much less focus to the user's interaction
    with the model. Generally, the user's interaction with the AI component is decided
    by the software engineering teams; unfortunately, in most organizations, the data
    science and AI teams work in silos. But it is the UI that controls the level of
    visibility, explainability, or interpretability of the AI models and plays a vital
    role in influencing the user's trust in the system.

    how the user''s interaction with the system through the UI gives more confidence
    to the user about the working of the AI/ML system. Hence, the UI should be in
    alignment with the AI model and its explainability methods to calibrate the user''s
    trust. You can find out more about calibrating the user''s trust using the UI

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike conventional approaches, the user-centric approach recommends involving
    the final user(s) early in the development process. The end user should in fact
    be involved from the design phase of the UI of the system, so that the needs of
    the user are correctly mapped into the interface. Similar to the design and development
    life cycle of the solution, explainability should also be evolved in an iterative
    process by taking continuous feedback from the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the ENDURANCE ideology views the XAI/ML system as one solution, the entire
    solution should have a *design phase*, *prototype phase*, *development phase*,
    and *evaluation phase*. These four phases would collectively form *one iteration
    of design and development*. Likewise, the entire solution should be matured in
    several iterations, keeping the user involved in every single phase of each iteration.
    This process is also in alignment with the *agile methodology* followed in software
    engineering. Involvement of the user in every phase ensures that useful feedback
    is collected for evaluating whether the user's needs are being met by the solution.
    Early involvement also ensures that the users are familiar with the design and
    working of the new system. Users' familiarity with the system increases the adoption
    rate of the system.

    to generate an example using all the features used for the prediction. But suppose
    the user is only interested in changing a specific set of actionable variables.
    In that case, the controlled counterfactuals should modify only the features that
    are interesting to the user. It has been found that a tailor-made personalized
    solution is often more useful to the end user than a generalized solution. So,
    using the feedback obtained from the user, try to provide a personalized solution
    meeting the specific pain points of the user.

    Testing** (**UAT**) phase is used to determine the *go* or *no-go* for software.
    Similarly, before the final production phase, more and more organizations prefer
    doing a robust UAT process for AI/ML systems. But *how important is the explainability
    of AI algorithms, when doing UAT of AI/ML systems?* *Can explainability increase
    the user acceptance of AI?* The short answer is *yes*! Let''s go through the following
    points to understand why:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the user''s trust in AI, it increases the chance of the user''s acceptance of
    the solution. Now, trust is something that cannot just be established during the
    UAT phase; rather, trust should be established from the beginning and maintained
    throughout the development process. The capabilities and limitations of the system
    should be communicated from the beginning to set a clear expectation of what is
    possible and what is not possible.'

    systems cannot be 100% accurate every single time. It is not practically possible
    to achieve systems that have zero error or zero failure. But as a recommended
    practice, it is important to document the possible failure points for the system
    and the consequences of the potential failures of the system are termed **risk**.
    **Risk tolerance** is the maximum permissible error that the system can make without
    causing a huge impact. So, during the UAT phase, it is important to define the
    risks of the solution and have an estimation of the maximum risk tolerance of
    the user. The system''s ability to perform within the risk tolerance should be
    considered a success criterion for the UAT process.'

    studies and qualitative and quantitative analysis of the user''s feedback are
