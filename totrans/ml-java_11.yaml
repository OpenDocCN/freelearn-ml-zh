    in Java libraries and discussing how to leverage them to solve real-life problems.
    However, this should not be the end of your journey by all means. This chapter
    will give you some practical advice on how to start deploying your models in the
    real world, what are the catches, and where to go to deepen your knowledge. It
    also gives you further pointers about where to find additional resources, materials,
    venues, and technologies to dive deeper into machine learning.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, data typically contains errors and imperfections due to various
    reasons such as measurement errors, human mistakes, and errors of expert judgment
    in classifying training examples. We refer to all of these as **noise**. Noise
    can also come from the treatment of missing values when an example with unknown
    attribute value is replaced by a set of weighted examples corresponding to the
    probability distribution of the missing value. The typical consequences of noise
    in learning data are low prediction accuracy of a learned model in new data and
    complex models that are hard to interpret and understand for the user.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Class unbalance is a problem we come across in [Chapter 7](bed72516-7a74-4875-a082-43364a4d6c59.xhtml),
    *Fraud and Anomaly Detection*, where the goal was to detect fraudulent insurance
    claims. The challenge is that a very large part of the dataset, usually more than
    90%, describes normal activities, and only a small fraction of the dataset contains
    fraudulent examples. In such a case, if the model always predicts normal, then
    it is correct 90% of the time. This problem is extremely common in practice and
    can be observed in various applications, including fraud detection, anomaly detection,
    medical diagnosis, oil spillage detection, and facial recognition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, knowing what the class unbalance problem is and why it is a problem, let's
    take a look at how to deal with this problem. The first approach is to focus on
    measures other than classification accuracy, such as recall, precision, and f-measure.
    Such measures focus on how accurate a model is at predicting minority class (**recall**)
    and what is the share of false alarms (**precision**). The other approach is based
    on resampling, where the main idea is to reduce the number of overrepresented
    examples in such a way that the new set contains a balanced ratio of both classes.

    Moreover, we can use multiple models—ensembles—turning any model into a feature.
    This is a great way to get better results, but this can lead to problems too.
    Care must be taken that the output of your model is ready to accept dependencies.
    Also, try to avoid feedback loops, as they can create dependencies and bottlenecks
    in the pipeline.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important aspect is model evaluation. Unless you apply your models to
    new data and measure a business objective, you're not doing predictive analytics.
    Evaluation techniques, such as cross-validation and separated train/test sets,
    simply split your test data, which can give only you an estimate of how your model
    will perform. Life often doesn't hand you a train dataset with all of the cases
    defined, so there is a lot of creativity involved in defining these two sets in
    a real-world dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the day, we want to improve a business objective, such as improve
    ad conversion rate, and get more clicks on recommended items. To measure the improvement,
    execute A/B tests, measuring differences in metrics across statistically identical
    populations that each experience a different algorithm. Decisions on the product
    are always data-driven.

    changes to sales emails to search ads. Udacity offers a free course, covering

    as the model predicted, and whether the candidate responded to campaign, the feedback
    should be used to improve the initial model:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The feedback could be really useful to improve the initial model, but make sure
    to pay attention to the data you are sampling. For instance, if you have a model
    that predicts who will respond to a campaign, you will initially use a set of
    randomly contacted clients with specific responded/not responded distribution
    and feature properties. The model will focus only on a subset of clients that
    will most likely respond and your feedback will return you a subset of clients
    that responded. By including this data, the model is more accurate in a specific
    subgroup, but might completely miss some other group. We call this problem exploration
    versus exploitation. Some approaches to address this problem can be found in Osugi
    et al. (2005) and Bondu et al. (2010).
