- en: In this section, we will look at some of the alternatives to Feast, which include
    a few managed feature store offerings. We will also deep-dive into Amazon SageMaker
    Feature Store, which will help us compare Feast (a self-managed infrastructure)
    to a managed feature store. We will also run through ML best practices and, finally,
    an end-to-end ML use case with a managed feature store, which includes feature
    engineering, model training, and model inference, along with feature and model
    monitoring examples.
