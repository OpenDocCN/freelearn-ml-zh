- en: In today’s data-driven era, where more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are
    produced daily in various forms such as text, image, audio, and video, data stands
    as the cornerstone of the AI revolution. However, the majority of real-world data
    available for training supervised machine learning models lacks labels, or we
    encounter limited labeled data. This presents a significant challenge, as labeled
    data is essential for training any supervised machine learning model and fine-tuning
    large language models in the age of generative AI.

- en: To address the scarcity of labeled data and facilitate the preparation of labeled
    data for training supervised machine learning models and fine-tuning large language
    models, this book introduces various methods for programmatic data labeling using
    Python libraries and methods, including semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.

- en: This book guides you through the process of loading and analyzing tabular data,
    images, videos, audio, and text using various Python libraries, the OpenAI API,
    LangChain, and Azure Machine Learning. It explores techniques such as weak supervision,
    pseudo-labeling, and K-means clustering for classification and labeling, while
    also providing data augmentation methods to enhance accuracy. Utilizing the Azure
    OpenAI API and LangChain, the book demonstrates the automation of data analysis
    using natural language without the need to acquire any programming skills. It
    also encompasses the classification and data labeling of text data using OpenAI
    and **large language models** (**LLMs**). This book covers a wide variety of open
    source data annotation tools, along with Azure Machine Learning, and compares
    the pros and cons of these tools.
