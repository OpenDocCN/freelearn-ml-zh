<p><span>Moving data analysis to the cloud is only one part of the way machine learning projects have changed over the last few years. Since the benefits of adding automation, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>), and machine learning to many different parts of business operations are now clear and don't need further proof, companies are now focused on more permanent solutions. In fact, the natural follow-up is to think about finished products that can complete the full data cycle, from data collection to visualization.</span></p>
<p>There are many ways to create data analysis flows that can consume data as it is created and return results and visualizations after applying machine learning models. Cloud services make this task easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>Automatic machine learning is the current tendency in data analysis, where several machine learning models can be tested on the same dataset, automatically. Model parameters are optimized until the best model is found. This allows the concept of the <em>citizen data scientist</em>,Â its a role that analyzes data and creates data and business models for their companies with the help of big data tools and technologies. Citizen data scientists do not necessarily need to be data science or business intelligence experts. This role is given to employees in an organization who can use the big data tools and technology to create data models.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic data analysis flows</li>
<li>Re-training of machine learning models</li>
<li>Automatic machine learning</li>
<li>What can we expect in the future?</li>
</ul>

<p>A few years before this book was written, businesses were approaching machine learning with the phrase <em>Let's see what this thing can do...</em> in mind. That is not the case any more. The value of using analytics, machine learning models, AI, and advanced visualizations to understand, simplify, and predict the outcome of many different situations is clear. This value is measured in terms of money, time, and effort savings, which leads to better and faster business decisions.</p>
<p>As a summary of what we have learned throughout this book, we can list the different parts of a data analysis flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection, usually from diverse sources</li>
<li>Data cleansing and preparation, including exploratory visualizations</li>
<li>Choosing a machine learning model that suits our data</li>
<li>Training the model with historical data (if we are talking about supervised learning)</li>
<li>Mining the data for hidden or unknown patterns (if we are talking about unsupervised learning)</li>
<li>Testing the accuracy of the model prediction</li>
<li>Fine-tuning the model parameters or changing the model if the results are not satisfactory</li>
<li>Visualizing the results</li>
<li>Periodically re-training the model with new data</li>
</ul>
<p>The following schema illustrates these steps:</p>

<p>In the following subsections, we will discuss in detail how each of these steps is automatized.</p>

<p>Once the different data sources (on-premise files and databases) are identified, the data can be periodically uploaded to a cloud storage service. This is usually done automatically by a process running periodically, with minimal human intervention. There are many different storage options available from the main cloud service providers.</p>
<p>This concept is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e72f813d-74e4-420e-9cc4-4a18f0e98b27.png" style="width:19.33em;height:14.83em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">The next step is to prepare the data for feeding it into the models, that is, data preparation.</p>

<p>The full data cycle is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d272cf4d-bcee-408b-ab28-961ef3ab7890.png" style="width:26.67em;height:26.67em;"/></p>
<p>After importing data to the cloud service, the data cycle steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merge datasets into a single table or set of connected tables. This might require some processing of the data to convert it to a suitable format.</li>
<li>Rebuild missing data, by replacing missing values or deciding to discard the incomplete entries.</li>
<li>Standardize the units of measure, decimal precision, and other characteristics of the data.</li>
<li>Normalize the data, especially if the machine learning model requires that.</li>
<li>De-duplicate, that is, remove redundant entries.</li>
<li>Verify the data quality using pre-defined criteria and enrich it by adding calculations.</li>
<li>Export the data to the next analysis phase, usually the machine learning models.</li>
</ol>
<p>All cloud providers offer a built-in or third-party solution for data preparation. Some alternatives are Amazon QuickSight, the Azure Machine Learning Data Prep SDK, Cloud Dataprep in Google Cloud, and many others.</p>

<p>The training cycle of a supervised machine learning model can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6d080964-72bd-4aab-93a1-d8b8a205e1b4.png" style="width:46.58em;height:16.58em;"/></p>
<p>The prepared data is split into train and test sets. The test results give feedback to modify the model hyperparameters and the model type, and give hints as to the amount of data necessary to get good accuracy.</p>
<p>The final step is to deploy the model to make it available (for example, as a web service), but also to register everything that characterizes a particular training run. The type of model, all hyperparameters, and even the data used should be saved as metadata.</p>
<p>There are many pre-built models available for use in the cloud and methods to register and manage different models.</p>

<p>Whenever we are not sure of what we are going to find in data or we need to process a very large number of entries that would be impossible to manage manually, we use unsupervised machine learning. A general diagram could be as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bcc61150-df11-4e51-9dff-7bf85d798034.png" style="width:33.92em;height:19.25em;"/></p>
<p>After going through the model, data is ordered and shows patterns that might be useful for making informed decisions. We can apply all of the models available in the cloud and then choose the one that better suits our needs for knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p>The last step in the data flow is <strong>visualization</strong>. When presenting our results to a non-technical audience, stressing the benefits of our analysis is of paramount importance to show the value of what we do. Interactive dashboards are the usual way of doing this, with advanced tools such as <strong>Tableau</strong>, <strong>Power BI</strong>, or <strong>QlikView</strong>. Some examples can be found at the following URL: <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/executive-dashboard-examples/">https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/executive-dashboard-examples/</a>.</p>
<p>Every dashboard tool can be either used online or connected to the cloud to show the analysis results.</p>

<p>Since new data is available all the time and business conditions change, machine learning models need periodic re-training. Cloud services offer ways of doing this with minimum intervention, without the need to rebuild any part of the data flow. You only need to load new data and specify that you are not building a new model but re-training an existing one. After finishing, the model will be available for use as usual.</p>
<p><span>In this section, we have showed a full data analysis flow that can be completely hosted in the cloud. The section is also useful as a detailed summary of the book's contents. The next section outlines the real future of machine learning, when coding and manual work will be reduced to an absolute minimum.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Automated machine learning</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are several tasks that are crucial for the success of a machine learning model when applied to solve a given business problem, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data pre-processing</li>
<li>Feature engineering</li>
<li>Model selection</li>
<li>Optimization of the model hyperparameters</li>
<li>Analysis of the model results</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks were usually performed more or less manually by experts in the field. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in <em>democratizing</em> machine learning, allowing for non-experts (sometimes called <em>citizen</em> <em>data</em> <em>scientists</em>) to use, improve, and apply machine learning to concrete problems. <strong>Automated Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>AutoML</strong>) targets that specific need.</p>
<p>In general, the building process of a new model can be described as in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/564fc815-22f0-4621-97e3-3dd7ca2e9149.png" style="width:45.50em;height:15.25em;"/></p>
<p>Following is the process for building of new model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input data is pre-processed and used to build the best model features</li>
<li>Based on some configurations done by the user, a given set of models is built and tested</li>
<li>Models are evaluated and tested based on some criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the work involved in developing, fine-tuning, and evaluating models is done automatically. The outcome is the best possible model, according to the input data and to the conditions given by the user.</p>
<p>Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all have AutoML capabilities, either using proprietary code or external packages. Alternative solutions exist, such as <strong>TPOT</strong> and <strong>H2O.ai</strong>.</p>
<p>The future of machine learning is already here. Without the need to write code and with minimum knowledge of a toolset, anyone can build a full data analysis flow. This is both an advantage and a risk: skilled analysts can test different options more quickly and optimize their work; unskilled people can use solutions such as black boxes without fully understanding how they work, possibly misunderstanding the results and making bad decisions. The ultimate responsibility belongs, as with any business tool, to the interested user.</p>

<p>The last chapter of the book is thought of both as a summary of all chapters and as a window to what can be done beyond Excel and in the future. Automated data flows and machine learning model generation simplify analysts' work and speed up the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you now have a wide view of what machine learning is, how to use it in each line of business, and what are the most advanced alternatives to what was known before reading this book.</p>
