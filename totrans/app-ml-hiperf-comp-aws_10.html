			<h1 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Data Visualization</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapters, we discussed various AWS services and tools that can help with building and running high-performance computation applications. We talked about the storage, compute instances, data processing, machine learning model building and hosting, and edge deployment of these applications. All these applications, especially those based around machine learning models, generally need some type of visualization. This visualization may vary from exploratory data analysis to model evaluation and comparison, to building dashboards showing various performance and <span class="No-Break">business metrics.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data visualization</strong> is very important for finding various business insights as well as deciding on what feature engineering steps to take to train a machine learning model that provides good results. AWS provides a few managed services to build data visualizations, as well <span class="No-Break">as dashboards.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to discuss one such option, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, that enables users working in the domains of data science, machine learning, and analytics to build insightful data visualizations without writing much code. SageMaker Data Wrangler provides several in-built visualization options, along with the capability of adding custom visualizations with a few clicks and not much effort. This helps the data scientists with exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and experimentation processes involved in any data-driven <span class="No-Break">use case.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, we will also briefly touch upon the topic of AWS’s graphics-optimized instances, since these instances can be used to create animated live data visualizations along with other high-performance computing applications such as game streaming and <span class="No-Break">machine learning.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data visualization using Amazon SageMaker <span class="No-Break">Data Wrangler</span></li>
				<li>Amazon’s <span class="No-Break">graphics-optimized instances</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Data visualization using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler</strong> is a tool in SageMaker Studio that helps data scientists and machine learning practitioners carry out exploratory data analysis and feature engineering/transformation. SageMaker Data Wrangler is a low-code/no-code tool where users <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>can either use built-in plotting or feature engineering capabilities or use code to make custom plots and carry out custom feature engineering. In data science projects with large datasets requiring visualization to carry out exploratory data analysis, SageMaker Data Wrangler can help<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> build plots and visualizations very quickly with just a few clicks. We can import data from various data sources into Data Wrangler and also do operations such as joins and filtering. In addition, data insights and quality reports can also be generated to detect if there are any abnormalities in <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we will go through an example of how to build a workflow to carry out data analysis and visualization using SageMaker <span class="No-Break">Data Wrangler.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>SageMaker Data Wrangler visualization options</h2>
			<p>In SageMaker<a id="_idIndexMarker726"/> Data Wrangler, first, we need to import the data and then build a workflow to carry out various transformation and visualization tasks. At the time of writing, data can be imported into SageMaker Data Wrangler from Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> shows the <strong class="bold">Import data</strong> screen in Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler. To add data from Amazon Redshift, we need to click on the <strong class="bold">Add data source</strong> button near the <span class="No-Break">top right:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – SageMaker Data Wrangler Data’s import interface</p>
			<p>Next, we will show an example of importing data into SageMaker Data Wrangler from Amazon S3, and then illustrate the various visualization options for this data. We are going to use the <em class="italic">Adult </em>dataset available at the University of California at Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository (<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult</a>). This dataset classifies an individual into two classes: whether the person earns more than 50,000 dollars a year or not. There are various numerical and categorical features in the dataset. While importing the data, we can select whether we want to load the entire dataset or a sample of <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>the dataset. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> shows the workflow created by SageMaker Data Wrangler after importing the entire <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Adult</em></span><span class="No-Break"> dataset:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Workflow created by SageMaker Data Wrangler after importing the data</p>
			<p>By pressing the plus sign on the block on the right, we can add transformation and visualization steps to the workflow, as we are going to <span class="No-Break">demonstrate next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Adding visualizations to the data flow in SageMaker Data Wrangler</h2>
			<p>After importing the<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> data, we can also view the data in SageMaker Data Wrangler, along with the column (variable) types. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> shows a view of the Adult data table. This view can help data scientists and analysts quickly look at the data and <span class="No-Break">validate it:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer138" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18493_10_003.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Adult data table along with the column types"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.3 – Adult data table along with the column types</p>
			<p>To construct various visualizations on our dataset, we must press the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign on the <strong class="bold">Transform: adult.csv</strong> block shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>. This shows us the various analysis and visualization options available in SageMaker Data Wrangler. We will now look at a few visualization examples while using SageMaker Data Wrangler on the <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Adult</em></span><span class="No-Break"> dataset.</span></p>
			<h3>Histogram</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">histogram</strong> is one of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>commonly used plots that data scientists and analysts use in their exploratory data <a id="_idIndexMarker730"/>analysis, as well as for building the final reports of machine learning model results. SageMaker Data Wrangler provides the option of building histograms very quickly without writing any code. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> shows a histogram plotted with SageMaker Data Wrangler, showing the distribution of the <strong class="source-inline">education-num</strong> (number of years of education) variable. We have also colored this distribution using the <strong class="source-inline">income</strong> target variable to show how income depends on the number of years <span class="No-Break">of education:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer139" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18493_10_004.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Histogram of the number of education years (education-num), colored for the two classes (&lt;=50k and &gt; 50k)"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.4 – Histogram of the number of education years (education-num), colored for the two classes (&lt;=50k and &gt; 50k)</p>
			<p>In addition to color, we<a id="_idIndexMarker731"/> can also <a id="_idIndexMarker732"/>use the <strong class="bold">Facet by</strong> feature, which plots a histogram of one column for each value in another column. This is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>, where we have plotted the histogram of <strong class="source-inline">education-num</strong> colored by income. This is faceted by the <strong class="source-inline">sex</strong> variable to show the distribution for males and <span class="No-Break">females separately:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer140" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18493_10_005.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – Histogram of the number of education years (education-num), colored for the two classes (&lt;=50k and &gt; 50k), and faceted by sex"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.5 – Histogram of the number of education years (education-num), colored for the two classes (&lt;=50k and &gt; 50k), and faceted by sex</p>
			<p>We can see that creating<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> histograms with multiple columns this way with just a few clicks and no need to write any code<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> can be very useful for carrying out quick exploratory analysis and building reports in a short amount of time. This is often needed for several high-performance computation use cases, such as <span class="No-Break">machine learning.</span></p>
			<h3>Scatter plot</h3>
			<p>With a <strong class="bold">scatter plot</strong>, we can plot the data points as a function of two or more variables using the <em class="italic">X</em> and <em class="italic">Y</em> axes, as<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> well as color. Furthermore, like histograms, scatter plots can also be faceted by the values in an additional column. This type of data plot is useful when we want to see the relationship between variables and not just the distribution. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> shows the scatter plot of <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> versus <strong class="source-inline">education-num</strong>, faceted <span class="No-Break">by </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">sex</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer141" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18493_10_006.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Scatter plot of age versus education-num, faceted by sex, for the Adult dataset"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.6 – Scatter plot of age versus education-num, faceted by sex, for the Adult dataset</p>
			<p>Combined with histograms, scatter<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> plots are extremely useful visualization tools that are used for exploratory data analysis in<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> machine learning <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
			<h3>Multicollinearity</h3>
			<p>In a dataset, <strong class="bold">multicollinearity</strong> arises when variables are related to each other. This is important in machine learning use cases since data dimensionality can be reduced if multicollinearity is detected. Data<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> dimensionality reduction helps with avoiding the curse of dimensionality, as well as improving the performance of machine learning models. Furthermore, it also helps with reduced model training time, storage space, memory requirements, and data processing time during inference, hence cutting down on total cost. In SageMaker Data Wrangler, we can use the following methods to detect multicollinearity in <span class="No-Break">our variables:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Variance Inflation </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Factor</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VIF</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Principal Component </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Analysis</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">PCA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Lasso <span class="No-Break">feature selection</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will show examples of each of these methods using our <em class="italic">Adult</em> dataset in SageMaker <span class="No-Break">Data Wrangler.</span></p>
			<h4>VIF</h4>
			<p>VIF indicates whether a variable is correlated to other variables or not. It is a positive number with a value of <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>one indicating that the variable is uncorrelated to other variables in the dataset. A value greater than one means that<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> the variable is correlated with other variables in the dataset. The higher the value, the higher the correlation with other variables. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> shows the VIF plot for the numerical variables in the <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Adult</em></span><span class="No-Break"> dataset:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer142" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18493_10_007.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – VIF for the various numerical variables in the Adult dataset"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.7 – VIF for the various numerical variables in the Adult dataset</p>
			<p>As can be seen, <strong class="source-inline">education-num</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">hours-per-week</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> are highly correlated with other <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>variables, whereas <strong class="source-inline">capital-gain</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">capital-loss</strong> do not correlate with other variables based on the <span class="No-Break">VIF scores.</span></p>
			<h4>PCA</h4>
			<p>PCA is one of the most commonly used feature transformation and dimensionality reduction methods in machine learning. It is generally used not only as an exploratory data analysis tool but <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>also as a preprocessing step in supervised machine learning problems. PCA projects data onto dimensions<a id="_idIndexMarker743"/> that are orthogonal to each other. The variables that are generated this way are ordered with decreasing variance (or singular values). These variances can be used to<a id="_idIndexMarker744"/> determine how much multicollinearity is in the variables. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em> shows the results of applying PCA to our <em class="italic">Adult</em> dataset using SageMaker <span class="No-Break">Data Wrangler:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer143" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.8 – Results of PCA on the Adult dataset using SageMaker Data Wrangler</p>
			<p>As can be inferred from this figure, most of the variables do not have multicollinearity, whereas a few <span class="No-Break">variables do.</span></p>
			<h4>Lasso feature selection</h4>
			<p>In SageMaker Data <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>Wrangler, we can use lasso feature selection to find the most predictive variables for the target variable<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> in our dataset. It uses the L1 regularization method to generate coefficients for each variable. A higher coefficient <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>score means that the feature is more predictive of the target variable. Just like VIF and PCA, lasso feature selection is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets in machine learning use cases. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em> shows the results of applying lasso feature selection to our <em class="italic">Adult</em> dataset in SageMaker <span class="No-Break">Data Wrangler:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer144" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.9 – Lasso feature selection results on the Adult dataset using SageMaker Data Wrangler</p>
			<p>Next, we will discuss how we can also study variable importance using SageMaker Data Wrangler’s Quick <span class="No-Break">Model feature.</span></p>
			<h3>Quick Model</h3>
			<p>We can use <strong class="bold">Quick Model</strong> in Data Wrangler to evaluate variable/feature importance for our machine learning dataset. Quick Model trains<a id="_idIndexMarker748"/> a random forest regressor or random forest classifier, depending<a id="_idIndexMarker749"/> on the supervised learning problem type, and determines feature importance scores using the Gini importance method. The feature importance score is between 0 and 1, and a higher feature importance value indicates greater importance of that feature for the dataset. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.10</em> shows the quick model plot created using SageMaker Data Wrangler for our <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Adult</em></span><span class="No-Break"> dataset:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer145" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18493_10_010.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – Quick Model results for the Adult dataset using SageMaker Data Wrangler"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.10 – Quick Model results for the Adult dataset using SageMaker Data Wrangler</p>
			<p>Quick Model can help data scientists quickly evaluate the importance of features, and then use the results for dimensionality reduction, model performance improvement, or <span class="No-Break">business insights.</span></p>
			<h3>Bias report</h3>
			<p>With a <strong class="bold">bias report</strong>, we can visualize if there is a potential bias or class imbalance in our dataset. This information can then <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>be used to carry out class balancing, feature transformation, and model improvement. With SageMaker Data Wrangler, we can visualize class imbalance<a id="_idIndexMarker751"/> as well as several bias parameters for the dataset. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.11</em> shows an example of a bias report for the <strong class="source-inline">sex</strong> variable (male or female), showing class imbalance and two <span class="No-Break">other metrics:</span></p>

			<p>For more information on these metrics, please refer to the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<h3>Data quality and insights report</h3>
			<p>We can also build a data quality and insights report in SageMaker Data Wrangler. This report shows things such <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>as a table summary, duplicate rows, the distribution of a target variable, anomalous samples, results of<a id="_idIndexMarker753"/> running a Quick Model, a confusion matrix (for classification problems), a feature summary along <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>with feature importance, and feature detail plots. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 10</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em> shows the table summary for the <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Adult</em></span><span class="No-Break"> dataset:</span></p>

			<p>Having access to these <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>plots, metrics, and<a id="_idIndexMarker756"/> distributions with just <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>a few clicks saves a lot of time and effort while performing exploratory <span class="No-Break">data analysis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Data flow</h2>
			<p>As we add steps to our <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>data analysis in SageMaker Data Wrangler, they show up in the data flow.

			<p>SageMaker Data Wrangler allows the results of these steps to be exported to the SageMaker Feature Store or Amazon S3. Furthermore, we can also export these steps as code to SageMaker pipelines or as <span class="No-Break">Python code.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>discussed the various visualization options in Amazon SageMaker using SageMaker Data Wrangler. There is a variety of built-in visualization and exploratory analysis options in Data Wrangler that we can use in our machine learning use cases. In the next section, we are going to discuss Amazon’s graphics-optimized <span class="No-Break">instance options.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Amazon’s graphics-optimized instances</h1>
			<p>Amazon has a variety of graphics-optimized instances that can be used in high-performance computing applications <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>such as machine learning use cases and applications that require graphics-intensive computation workload. These instances are available with either NVIDIA GPUs or AMD GPUs and are required for high-performance computation use cases such as game streaming, graphics rendering, machine learning, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Benefits and key features of Amazon’s graphics-optimized instances</h2>
			<p>In this section, we will outline a few of the benefits and key features of Amazon’s <span class="No-Break">graphics-optimized instances:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">High performance and low cost</strong>: Machines with good GPUs are generally quite expensive to<a id="_idIndexMarker762"/> purchase and difficult to scale due to their high cost. Amazon provides options to get high-performance instances equipped with state-of-the-art GPUs at low cost. These instances can be used to run graphics-intensive applications, build visualizations, and carry out machine learning training and inference. Also, these instances provide over a terabyte of NVMe-based solid-state storage for very fast access to local data, which is often needed in high-performance computation <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While AWS has a very wide variety of GPU-based instances that can be used for different types of high-performance computing applications, P3, P3dn, P4, and G4dn instances are especially suited for carrying out distributed machine learning model training tasks on multiple nodes. In addition, these instances can provide up to 400 gigabits per second of network bandwidth for applications that have very high <span class="No-Break">throughput requirements.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fully managed offerings</strong>: Amazon’s graphics-optimized instances can be provisioned as <strong class="bold">Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>) instances for a variety of use cases, including machine learning, numerical <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>optimization, graphics rendering, gaming, and streaming. Users can install custom kernels and libraries and manage them as needed. These instances also support Amazon machine images for common deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. In addition, users can use these instances within Amazon SageMaker to train deep learning models. When used within SageMaker for training jobs, these instances are fully managed by AWS and are used only for the duration of the training job, thus reducing the <span class="No-Break">cost significantly.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the following section, we will summarize what we have learned in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed how to build quick visualizations for analytics and machine learning use cases using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler. We showed a few of the various exploratory data analysis, plotting, and data transformation options available within SageMaker Data Wrangler. The ability to quickly and easily build these visualizations and bias and quality reports is very important for data scientists and practitioners in the machine learning domain since it helps in cutting down on the cost and effort associated with exploratory data analysis significantly. In addition, we discussed Amazon’s graphics-optimized instances that are available for high-performance computing applications such as game streaming, rendering, and machine learning <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
			<p>From the next chapter onwards, we will start discussing various applications of high-performance computing and applied machine learning, with the first one being computational <span class="No-Break">fluid dynamics.</span></p>

			<p>AWS provides high-performance storage, compute, and networking services to serve typical <strong class="bold">high-performance computing</strong> (<strong class="bold">HPC</strong>) applications that span various verticals, including multi-physics modeling, genomics, computer-aided design and simulation, and weather modeling and prediction, as well as applications such as <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>). In this part, we cover four major HPC applications, how they are set up and solved on AWS, and end each chapter with how emerging research in ML is used in conjunction with the classic ways to solve these typical <span class="No-Break">HPC problems.</span></p>
