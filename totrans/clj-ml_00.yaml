- en: Machine learning has a vast variety of applications in computing. Software systems
    that use machine learning techniques tend to provide their users with a better
    user experience. With cloud data becoming more relevant these days, developers
    will eventually build more intelligent systems that simplify and optimize any
    routine task for their users.

    how we can leverage these techniques in the Clojure programming language.

- en: Clojure is a dynamic and functional programming language built on the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM). It's important to note that Clojure is a member of the Lisp family
    of languages. Lisp played a key role in the artificial intelligence revolution
    that took place during the 70s and 80s. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence
    lost its spark in the late 80s. Lisp, however, continued to evolve, and several
    dialects of Lisp have been concocted throughout the ages. Clojure is a simple
    and powerful dialect of Lisp that was first released in 2007\. At the time of
    writing this book, Clojure is one of the most rapidly growing programming languages
    for the JVM. It currently supports some of the most advanced language features
    and programming methodologies out there, such as optional typing, software transactional
    memory, asynchronous programming, and logic programming. The Clojure community
    is known to mesmerize developers with their elegant and powerful libraries, which
    is yet another compelling reason to use Clojure.

- en: Machine learning techniques are based on statistics and logic-based reasoning.
    In this book, we will focus on the statistical side of machine learning. Most
    of these techniques are based on principles from the artificial intelligence revolution.
    Machine learning is still an active area of research and development. Large players
    from the software world, such as Google and Microsoft, have also made significant
    contributions to machine learning. More software companies are now realizing that
    applications that use machine learning techniques provide a much better experience
    to their users.

- en: Although there is a lot of mathematics involved in machine learning, we will
    focus more on the ideas and practical usage of these techniques, rather than concentrating
    on the theory and mathematical notations used by these techniques. This book seeks
    to provide a gentle introduction to machine learning techniques and how they can
    be used in Clojure.

    reduction.'

    Kit (JDK), which you can get from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/).
    JDK is necessary to run and develop applications on the Java platform.

- en: The other major software that you'll need is Leiningen, which you can download
    and install from [http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).
    Leiningen is a tool for managing Clojure projects and their dependencies. We will
    explain how to work with Leiningen in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Working
    with Matrices"), *Working with Matrices*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout this book, we'll use a number of other Clojure and Java libraries,
    including Clojure itself. Leiningen will take care of the downloading of these
    libraries for us as required. You'll also need a text editor or an integrated
    development environment (IDE). If you already have a text editor that you like,
    you can probably use it. Navigate to [http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started)
    to check the tips and plugins required for using your particular favorite environment.
    If you don't have a preference, I suggest that you look at using Eclipse with
    Counterclockwise. There are instructions for getting this set up at [http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise).
