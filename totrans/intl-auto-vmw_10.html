<p>VMware Global Services have built an intelligent support engine called Skyline, which collects customer-specific VMware products related data without any manual effort or compromise of security policies. It aggregates and analyzes this data to help the support team attain a quick time-to-resolution and take action to prevent upcoming issues.</p>
<p>We can get a full 360-degree view of VMware products in the customer's environment, from a deployment and usage perspective. We can help customers by providing them with more information and allowing them to interact with all customer endpoints for an overview of known and unknown issues. Skyline is necessary for mission-critical applications running on a VMware infrastructure, which is available 24/7, 365 days a year, and is highly optimized to achieve maximum performance from its resources. Customers want quick resolutions and suggestions, with all the supporting data analytics to recognize problems before they create issues in the customer environment. Skyline can take care of all of these requirements with its smart support system, which helps support engineers learn information and data about the specific customer's deployment of VMware products.</p>
<p>If we knew our customer's environment just like they did, then we would be able to suggest proactive, prescriptive, and predictive recommendations about a problem that might occur in the future, in advance. It would also help support teams with their reactive support cases, since these could be resolved more quickly to help customers get back to their businesses faster. VMware Skyline consists of three technology  (Collector, rule engine and Advisor) components. Global Services has innovative new support capabilities. </p>
<p>Proactive support with VMware Skyline offers many benefits, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customized support experience will deepen the relationship with the customer</li>
<li>Knowledge of customer usage will enable adoption of applications and value realization through customer success initiatives</li>
<li>Faster, higher quality support resolution</li>
<li>Optimum design, configuration, and software versions for customer-specific implementations</li>
<li>Improved reliability, with advanced warning systems</li>
<li><strong>Support request</strong> (<strong>SR</strong>) deflection to fix identified errors before they occur</li>
<li>Shorter time to resolution; that is, data is collected proactively and solutions are provided to allow for a faster diagnosis and resolution</li>
<li>Protection of a huge amount of money in <strong>Support and Subscription Services</strong> (<strong>SnS</strong>) bookings by delivering continuous incremental value</li>
<li>Increases the total deal size and compensation, and upsell customers from production support to premier services</li>
<li>Improved tools and technology</li>
<li>Visibility into customers' environments</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Skyline </span></span>Collector helps gather details about changes and occurrences in near real time and is isolated from the customer environment, as no customer-specific data is saved in the collector. VMware Skyline data is accessed on an as-needed basis by VMware support teams.</p>
<p>VMware Skyline Advisor will be a customer-facing, self-service dashboard that will be delivered as an SaaS application for customers. This will provide detailed analysis about the outcomes of identified alerts and suggested operations, so that customers can configure smart remediation. An advisor can be utilized and connected with a viewer to fully utilize this policy-based analysis engine, which is comprised of support intelligence libraries, product information, and logic to analyze the internal customer-specific product deployment data. This is used to get suggestions and detailed reports that can be shared with customers. It is well integrated with VMware validated design, best practices, and <span><strong>Knowledge Base</strong> (</span><strong>KB</strong>) articles, to send alerts, identify faults and issues, and any deviations from recommended design. It then initiates a remediation process with support assistance by support engineers, or faults and issues can be solved through self-service steps. Skyline has a single collector instance to collect and transfer VMware product-related information back to the <strong>VMware Analytics Cloud</strong> (<strong>VAC</strong>) infrastructure. Customers who have active product support can use Skyline Collector. It can analyze changes, activities, and patterns related to specific information such as faults by using a machine learning engine. The Skyline policy engine supports intelligence libraries, and product information and the relevant logic is saved to analyze the customer's internal flow of data that's relevant to <span>VMware </span>products. It send notices if the customer is not following VMware validated design practices to make configurations or patch management for VMware products. All of the problems that are identified are fed into the analytics engine, which has hundreds of detection policies to help us rectify the same kinds of problems for multiple customers. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

<p>VMware Skyline collects information about vSphere and NSX in a customer's environment<strong>. </strong>It can analyze telemetry information from vSphere and NSX. We plan to rapidly add support for more VMware technologies in the future with vSAN, which is next on our roadmap. Eventually, the full stack of products will be available on VMware Skyline. Our insights will get better with time, adding more predictive recommendations to reduce downtime and performance issues. VMware Skyline matures as the rules engine evolves in scope and complexity, so the value to customers will continue to grow. Customers will also be able to add and remove individual product deployments from collection. Skyline is available through the VMware managed access program at no cost for premier support customers (Mission Critical, Healthcare Critical, and Business Critical) with vSphere and NSX on-premises environments.</p>

<p>VMware's plan is to deliver incremental benefits and expand the scope of product and solution awareness to drive toward introducing customer self-service opportunities within the development and release a roadmap.</p>
<p>This will help us add value quickly as we introduce the VMware Skyline Viewer for support engineers, which is to be utilized in both proactive and reactive support engagements with customers. We plan to make the VMware Skyline Advisor workbench available to various support teams, along with product engineering teams, so that they can actively participate in the creation of new rules and analysis as we expand our ability to automatically detect known issues or recommendations. VMware Skyline will also provide added support service capabilities to customers in future who have production support and Premier Support Services in the form of self-service solutions.</p>
<p>VMware Skyline fits into Global Services' overall vision, as<strong> </strong>VMware strives to provide best in class support to our customers, as represented by our high customer satisfaction and <strong>net promoter score</strong> (<strong>NPS</strong>). As the competition attempts to close that gap, we innovate. VMware Skyline is one of those innovations that puts us ahead of the competition in both reactive and proactive support. No other full stack software company provides this level of capability. VMware Skyline focuses on transforming the customer experience, and the key way that we do this is by building customer intimacy. If we know and understand what our customers are doing, we can more readily engage with them proactively, in order to provide assistance and guidance.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>VMware Skyline can be rolled out in a very large customer environment, phase-wise and during the initial rollout. It is best to collect from a single vCenter, have the customer give us feedback on the value that we're providing, and then keep adding incrementally. There will be some scale scenarios that we will hit in the real world that we will never encounter in testing, and we can identify those through a measured adoption plan. We don't recommend any aggressive approaches to an initial enterprise software drop. The collector attaches itself to a vCenter. It can connect to multiple vCenters, as well, but it can always be split on a per-vCenter basis. Very large, multi-<span><span>vCenter</span></span> environments will also require multi-collector setups. The collector appliance should also be as near to the vCenter as possible, in terms of network traffic, so as to not stress sending data over the WAN. Multiple physical data centers will also lean toward multi-collector setups for each location. Data is tied together on the backend, so we know that it all came from the same customer.</p>
<p>At any point in time, customers can opt out of the <strong><span>Customer Experience Improvement Program</span></strong> (<strong>CEIP</strong>). Customers can unregister Skyline Collector from operations and disable all Skyline functionality from their environment. Data that's been collected will be retained for a 13-month period for customer-identifiable information, and for up to four years for other collected data. Product-related data is saved and used for different processes, along with the end-to-end security for this data. We can manage data and de-identify as required. We can encrypt data in storage and in motion, as well as all kinds of all kinds of physical security such as firewall, HIPS, IDS, and so on. We can also design data backups, disaster recovery, and other security processes for this data with proper auditing. VMware is responsible for managing this collected data to provide better technical support, along with product enhancement.</p>
<p>We must meet the criteria to gain access to VMware Skyline product usage data. This includes completing training for the product usage data policy, acknowledging your responsibility for how this data is used, and submitting a formal request that identifies other details about our intended use. The process continues with our manager's review, and, in exceptional cases, with the data trustee's review. If your request is approved, then your access can be provisioned at the approved system(s). We are planning to expand the requesting process to an enterprise identity access management system. This will be part of an external facing website that we can share with customers. </p>

<p>Most customers want data to be scrubbed, and VMware provides an in-house log scrubber script to customers. It removes IP addresses, hostnames, and so on from customer logs. Instead, a placeholder is added and a key is provided to the customer to associate the IP addresses and hostnames to the names that are inserted in the logs. This capability needs to be included in the Skyline appliance locally, so that the customer host and IP data are not transmitted. The customer may want some control (radio buttons or check boxes, for example) for different data if not all of their data needs have been scrubbed. The following table summarizes all of the required ports and protocols for Skyline's operation:</p>

<p>Skyline Collector's admin account authenticates and logs in to the Skyline Collector admin interface, and then it registers the application to manage collection endpoints. The admin account's password will be defined as the deployment starts and the collector is registered. Skyline Collector's root user will be used for updates with VAMI interface access at <kbd>https://&lt;Skyline_Collector_Appliance_IP_Address&gt;:5480</kbd>, when that user is notified of a pending update.</p>
<p>Skyline Collector needs read-only user access to connect to the VMware product (with license information) that's been installed on the customer premises, so that it can gather data and tie it to its respective deployment. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>It needs a user account in all concerned vCenter Server instances with the following privileges:</span></p>

<p>Skyline Collector is available in an <strong>open virtualization appliance</strong> (<strong>OVF</strong>) format, and it can be installed via the OVF deployment wizard from the vCenter Console. A virtual appliance consists of a preconfigured VM with a pre-installed guest OS, application, and other related software. We can access the collector admin interface through a web browser by including the IP address or hostname associated with the appliance after installing it.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating the client plugin</strong>:<strong> </strong>The client plugin provides access to the collector console and other vSphere capabilities through the vSphere Web Client. This plugin also helps to install other virtual appliances by using Windows session authentication through the vSphere Web Client.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Skyline Collector appliance</strong>:<strong> </strong>We can power on a collector appliance and then access the admin interface and obtain the IP address for the collector appliance, in order to explore the collector console:</p>

<p>After powering on the Skyline Collector appliance, we can obtain the IP address for that appliance. This can be done as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>As an administrator, log in to the vSphere Web Client</li>
<li>Right-click on <span class="packt_screen">Collector virtual appliance</span> and choose <span class="packt_screen">Power</span>. Then, click <span class="packt_screen">Power On</span></li>
<li>We can view the IP address of the collector appliance in the <span class="packt_screen">Summary</span> tab by refreshing the vSphere Web Client after powering on the virtual appliance</li>
<li>Browse to <kbd>https://&lt;Collector_Appliance_IP_Address&gt;</kbd> through the web browser</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Skyline Collector admin interface</strong>: Because the collector certificate doesn't match the hostname/IP address for the environment, a browser security warning will appear the first time we connect. First, we must log in with our default username and password:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ad99134d-b924-44c4-b462-7bca4d57d9c1.png" style="width:29.75em;height:22.17em;"/></p>
<p>Our default username is <kbd>admin</kbd>, and the password is also <kbd>default</kbd>. A password should have a minimum of eight characters, with one uppercase letter, one special character, one digit, and one lowercase letter.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Click on <span class="packt_screen">Change</span> after entering a new password for the admin account. We must log in to the Skyline Collector admin interface again after changing the password; we will get a <span class="packt_screen">Your password was changed successfully!</span> screen.</p>
<p>The connectivity is always one-way, from the Skyline Collector going outward to VAC or the Photon OS update library services. We have two methods of returning data to the Skyline Collector appliance. This can be done through the Photon OS VAMI interface for product updates/patches, and so on, and through manifest updates, where we can post an updated manifest that describes what data has been collected, at what interval, and so on. The appliance checks for manifest updates periodically, and when an update is available, it pulls the new manifest down to utilize its current configurations. <span>The collector must upload encrypted data to VMware via the internet. </span>If the collector requires an HTTP proxy to reach the internet, toggle the switch to <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> and configure the settings that are required by the proxy administrator. Click on <span class="packt_screen">TEST CONNECTIVITY</span> to validate the network's connectivity, and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Con</span><span class="packt_screen">tinue.</span></p>
<p>The collector will not be registered upon the first login. Registration of the collector is required to configure data collection. The registration wizard will automatically <span>appear</span> upon the first login.</p>

<p>We can participate in CEIP while registering Skyline Collector and initializing its process. <span>Skyline Collector data is vastly utilized for both support and product improvement purposes with the the CEIP:</span></p>
<p><span>Then, select </span><span class="packt_screen">AGREE AND CONTINUE</span><span>. </span><span>Collector registration requires an active My VMware account connected to an active VMware production support or premier services support entitlement. Enter your My VMware account email, password, and Entitlement Account ID. When ready, select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Link Account<span>:</span></span></p>
<p>Once the collector has successfully validated your credentials, click on <strong><span class="packt_screen">Continue</span></strong>. If customers have issues with their My VMware account login, please go to <a href="https://my.vmware.com" target="_blank">https://my.vmware.com</a> to reset the account credentials. You can get the health report of the Skyline Collector and all associated data endpoints from the system status page, in the <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span> section. We can manage collector services through restart, stop, or de-register through the collector section. It will also show the Skyline Collector ID and the My VMware user that was used for the registration process. The Skyline Collector ID is a particular identifier for every Skyline Collector instance and is used to recognize the data transfer back to VMware:</p>
<p>We can also customize the Skyline Collector name so that we can recognize the entitlement number and support type (production/premier services) associated with a Skyline Collector instance; that way, we can connect to a VMware Global Support Services team. This entitlement account connects Skyline Collector data to its respective support requests. These entitlement accounts can be accessed and driven through <a href="https://my.vmware.com">https://my.vmware.com</a>, and Skyline Collector log activities can be shown through the admin interface in real time. </p>

<p>Participation in the VMware CEIP is necessary and is a part of VMware Skyline. As a part of the initial Skyline Collector registration process, it is necessary to join this program. Skyline Collector sends data back to VMware for related product endpoints that are connected with specific product instances for quick support through the CEIP, which is included during the initial configuration or in the configuration page after installation. Customers can opt out of this program by following the de-registration process.</p>

<p>VMware product/service technical data consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configuration data</strong>: Every customer infrastructure is unique from a design and configuration point of view, even with the same VMware products and services. They have their own use cases, as per their business objectives, and data contains information such as the product's version/edition, deployment related information, settings, and the data logs of all of the devices that are connected to these products and services.</li>
<li><strong>Feature-related data</strong>: Customers deploy products with their functions in various ways, so that customers can achieve specific business case, for their respective customer's domain.</li>
<li><strong>Performance data</strong>: This includes information about products and services, along with all of the relevant supporting reports, such as performance and scale parameters, the user interface's response time, and API call related information.</li>
<li><strong>Product log data</strong>: They have related product logs that are produced by products from the installation stage to the production stage. These logs have details about the system's activity. This will also help with the actual status in real-time production data, excluding end customer application data.</li>

<p>Product-related data is securely managed and used in certain internal scenarios with proper customer intimation. It is also agreed upon and accepted by the Information Governance Executive Council. Product-related data can be utilized for different purposes, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product deployment reports</strong>:<strong> </strong><span>We can correlate a customer's actual product adoption to purchased product licenses. Account managers can only assess this report so that they can have a fruitful discussion with the customer and use the purchased products in an optimal way by enhancing their design and settings. </span></li>
<li><strong>SDDC analysis</strong>: This is used to analyze the deployment of SDDC products across the customer base. This can be used to identify customers that meet certain SDDC deployment criteria, which can be provided to VMware executive management.</li>
<li><strong>Customer advocacy surveys for new SDDC product releases</strong>: This is used to identify customers who have deployed new SDDC product releases. These customers can be contacted by executive management to request their responses to specific customer surveys.</li>
<li><strong>Customer support</strong>: Technical support engineers may use a VMware license key and derived customer ID values to contact the customer in order to help resolve a specific support request or to proactively give advice on a support issue the customer may encounter, based on the analysis of the product usage data.</li>
<li><strong>Customer profiles and advanced analytics</strong>: This is used to analyze customer interactions with VMware, in order to create customer profiles and advanced analytics models. These must only be made available to VMware management and need to be approved by the product usage data trustee. </li>
</ul>

<p>We can find details on the VMware Skyline deployment architecture, especially in a customer environment containing internal firewalls that segment different portions of the customer's network, each of which includes VMware products, in the product documentation. This covers the directional connectivity and networking port requirements for communications within customer networks and out to the internet/VAC destinations. We don't document on the northbound and southbound APIs of the collector, which are used to communicate with both the products that they are collecting and to the VMware Cloud. The APIs that we utilize for transmission of data back to the VAC can be found on the VAC confluence pages.</p>
<p>VMware Skyline is designed for the one-way communication of data back to VMware, and it ensures that the architecture has been developed to allow for closed-loop feedback to the collector and back to the products. The connectivity is always one-way from the Skyline Collector outward to VAC or the Photon OS update library services. We have two methods of providing return data to the Skyline Collector appliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the Photon OS VAMI interface, for product updates/patches, and so on</li>
<li>Via manifest updates, where we can post an updated manifest that describes, for example, what data is collected, at what interval, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>The appliance checks for manifest updates periodically, and when an update is available, it pulls the new manifest down to utilize its current configurations. The system will look to identify whether the <strong>distributed firewall</strong> (<strong>DFW</strong>) rules are active at the host or the VM level, in order to better troubleshoot connectivity issues as they arise. Skyline collector uses secure protocols to transmit the collected product usage data over HTTPS or SSH, back to VMware. The encryption algorithm is used to transfer the Skyline Collector data back to VMware.</p>
<p>Skyline pulls telemetry information from the product APIs and customer's inventory automatically over time, so that we can identify changes, patterns, and trends. This will help us to lower the time to solve an issue and identify problems before they turn into service availability, performance, or patch/security issues. Data that's collected by Skyline is stored in US-based VACs that are only operated by VMware. Snapshots of the protocols and encryptions are used with Skyline. Upstream encryption is done via TLS 1.2, using the cipher suite <kbd>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256</kbd>. The data that's collected is retained in the system in VAC and <span><strong>Operational Summary Reports</strong></span> (<strong>OSRs</strong>) for a period of 13 months, as per policy guidelines.</p>

<p>VMware Skyline's breakthrough of being able to dramatically transform our visibility of the customer's environment has many benefits. If we know and understand what our customers are doing, we can more readily engage with them proactively, in order to provide assistance and guidance.​ We can start to focus on the core problems when supporting them, so that we do not only rely on the symptoms that our customers describe. This drives confidence as we build and strengthen those relationships.​ At the core of VMware Skyline is a focus on transforming the customer experience, and the key way that we can do so is by building customer intimacy.​ We can start to focus on the core issues of customers with these reliable data rather then relying only on the symptoms or, customer's inputs.</p>
<p>The next chapter, <a href="ab83a378-8642-4264-9394-d0029ddae816.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>DevOps with vRealize Code Stream</em>, will provide you with a detailed architectural design that enables the application and platform to be deployed on the VMware vRealize Automation private cloud platform, using <strong>c</strong><strong>ontinuous integration</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>) and <strong>continuous</strong> <strong>delivery</strong> (<strong>CD</strong>) processes, alongside <strong>VMware vRealize Code Stream</strong> (<strong>vRCS</strong>) and other industry standard products. The architectural design recommendations will be based on a VMware vRA/vRO/vRCS product reference architecture and industry best practices, along with customer-specific requirements and business goals.</p>
