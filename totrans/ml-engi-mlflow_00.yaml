- en: Implementing a product based on machine learning can be a laborious task. There
    is a general need to reduce the friction between different steps of the machine
    learning development life cycle and between the teams of data scientists and engineers
    that are involved in the process.

- en: Machine learning practitioners such as data scientists and machine learning
    engineers operate with different systems, standards, and tools. While data scientists
    spend most of their time developing models in tools such as Jupyter Notebook,
    when running in production, the model is deployed in the context of a software
    application with an environment that's more demanding in terms of scale and reliability.

- en: In this book, you will be introduced to MLflow and machine learning engineering
    practices that will aid your machine learning life cycle, exploring data acquisition,
    preparation, training, and deployment. The book's content is based on an open
    interface design and will work with any language or platform. You will also gain
    benefits when it comes to scalability and reproducibility.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you will be able to comfortably deal with setting up
    a development environment for models using MLflow, framing your machine learning
    problem, and using a standardized framework to set up your own machine learning
    systems. This book is also particularly handy if you are implementing your first
    machine learning project in production.

- en: This book is geared toward software, machine learning, and data science professionals
    or enthusiasts who want to explore the engineering side of machine learning systems
    in production. Machine learning practitioners will be able to put their knowledge
    to work with this practical guide to MLflow. The book takes a hands-on approach
    to implementation and associated methodologies that will have you up and running
    with MLflow in no time. The basic requirements for this book are experience in
    Python programming and knowledge of the Bash terminal and commands.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16783_01_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introducing
    MLflow*, will be an overview of the different features of MLflow, guiding you
    in installing and exploring the core features of the platform. After reading this
    chapter, you will be able to install and operate your MLflow environment locally.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B16783_02_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor030), *Your Machine
    Learning Project*, introduces the focus of the book. The approach of this book
    is to work through a practical business case, namely stock market prediction,
    and, through this use case, explore all the different features of MLflow. A problem-framing
    framework will be used to get you deeply familiar with the example used in the
    book. A sample pipeline will be created for use in the remainder of the book.'

    so that you can develop your machine learning projects locally using all the different
    features provided by MLflow.'

    Management in MLflow*, is where you will gain practical experience of stock prediction
    by creating different models and comparing the metrics of different runs in MLflow.
    You will be guided as to how to deploy a tracking server so that many machine
    learning practitioners can share metrics and improve a model.'

    of the Python programming language and should have already created basic machine
    learning models. One introductory course in machine learning will help contextualize
