- en: AWS is a secure cloud platform that delivers on-demand computing power, databaseÂ storage,
    applications, and other IT resources, through a cloud services platform via the
    internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. As of 2018, AWS dominates the cloud
    infrastructure services worldwide market with ~30% of the market share, compared
    to the trailing Microsoft (~15%) and Google (~5%), as per Canalys (https://www.canalys.com/static/press_release/2018/270418-cloud-infrastructure-market-grows-47-q1-2018-despite-underuse.pdf).

    science that often uses statistical techniques to provide computers with the ability
    to learn with data without being programmed. Machine Learning explores the building
    and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions about,
    data. The algorithms transcend static instructions and make data-driven predictions

    ML allows insights from **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to power chatbots;
    fraud detection ML insights are used in the financial industry, and ML applications
    allow for efficient online recommendation engines, such as friend suggestions

    storing static content such as text files, images, audio files, video files, and
    so on. For example, S3 can be used as a static web server if the website consists
    exclusively of HTML and images. The website can be connected to an FTP client
    to serve the static files. In addition, S3 can also be used to store user generated
    image and text files.

    of data from physical storage devices into AWS. You mail your portable storage
    devices to AWS, and AWS Import/Export transfers data directly from your storage
    devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network. Your data load typically begins
    the next business day after your storage device arrives at AWS. After the data
    export or import completes, services return your storage device. For large datasets,
    AWS data transfer can be significantly faster than internet transfer and more
    cost-effective than upgrading your connectivity.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: S3 is used to store almost any type of file, thus, it can get confused with
    similarities to a traditional filesystem. However, S3 differs in a few ways from
    a traditional filesystem. Overall, the folders in a traditional file system are
    **Buckets** in S3; a file in a traditional filesystem is an **object** in S3\.
    S3 uses objects, since you can store any data type (that is, more than files)
    in Buckets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another difference is how objects can be accessed. Objects stored in Buckets
    can be accessed from a web service endpoint (such as a web browser, for example,
    Chrome, Firefox, and so on), so each object requires a globally unique name. The
    name restrictions for objects are similar to the restrictions in selecting a URL
    when creating a new website. Obviously, you need to select a unique URL, according
    to the same logic that your house has a unique address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you created a Bucket (with public permission settings) named
    `myBucket` and then uploaded a text file named `pos_sentiment__leaves_of_grass.txt`
    to the Bucket, the object would be accessible from a web browser via the corresponding
    subdomain.

    a Bucket. Buckets are the containers for objects, and you can control (create,

    data centers. Data replication benefits include high availability and durability.
    More specifically, when you create a new object in S3, the data is saved in S3;
    however, the change needs to be replicated across the Amazon S3 regions. Overall,
    replication may take some time, and you might notice delays resulting from various
    replication mechanisms. Please consider the following when performing the indicated
    operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data to display until the deletion is fully replicated. Creating an object and
    immediately trying to display it in the object list might be delayed as a result
    of a replication delay.

    what Machine Learning is, and what Artificial Intelligence is. Following this,
    you learned what Amazon S3 is, and why Amazon S3 is used. You also explored the
    basic requirements for working with AWS using S3\. With this, you used IAM (Identity
    and Access Management).

    explored the components of S3\. At the same time, you learned about the REST Interface.
    In the last part of this chapter, we looked at the AWS command line and its usages.
    Finally, we explored the concepts of recursion and parameters, and how to use
    the AWS Console to identify Machine Learning services.
