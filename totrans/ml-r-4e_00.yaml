- en: Machine learning, at its core, describes algorithms that transform data into
    actionable intelligence. This fact makes machine learning well suited to the present-day
    era of big data. Without machine learning, it would be nearly impossible to make
    sense of the massive streams of information that are now all around us.

- en: The cross-platform, zero-cost statistical programming environment called R provides
    an ideal pathway to start applying machine learning. R offers powerful but easy-to-learn
    tools that can assist you with finding insights in your own data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By combining hands-on case studies with the essential theory needed to understand
    how these algorithms work, this book delivers all the knowledge you need to get
    started with machine learning and to apply its methods to your own projects.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at people in applied fields—business analysts, social scientists,
    and others—who have access to data and hope to use it for action. Perhaps you
    already know a bit about machine learning, but have never used R; or, perhaps
    you know a little about R, but are new to machine learning. Maybe you are completely
    new to both! In any case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would
    be helpful to have a bit of familiarity with basic math and programming concepts,
    but no prior experience is required. All you need is curiosity.

- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Probabilistic Learning – Classification Using Naive Bayes*, reveals
    the essential concepts of probability that are used in cutting-edge spam filtering
    systems. You’ll learn the basics of text mining in the process of building your
    own spam filter.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Divide and Conquer – Classification Using Decision Trees and
    Rules*, explores a couple of learning algorithms whose predictions are not only
    accurate, but also easily explained. We’ll apply these methods to tasks where
    transparency is important.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Forecasting Numeric Data – Regression Methods*, introduces machine
    learning algorithms used for making numeric predictions. As these techniques are
    heavily embedded in the field of statistics, you will also learn the essential
    metrics needed to make sense of numeric relationships.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Black-Box Methods – Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines*,
    covers two complex but powerful machine learning algorithms. Though the math may
    appear intimidating, we will work through examples that illustrate their inner
    workings in simple terms.'

- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Finding Patterns – Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules*,
    exposes the algorithm used in the recommendation systems employed by many retailers.
    If you’ve ever wondered how retailers seem to know your purchasing habits better
    than you know yourself, this chapter will reveal their secrets.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Finding Groups of Data – Clustering with k-means*, is devoted
    to a procedure that locates clusters of related items. We’ll utilize this algorithm
    to identify profiles within an online community.'

- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Challenging Data – Too Much, Too Little, Too Complex*, considers
    solutions to a common set of problems that can derail a machine learning project
    when the useful information is lost within a massive dataset, much like a needle
    in a haystack.'
