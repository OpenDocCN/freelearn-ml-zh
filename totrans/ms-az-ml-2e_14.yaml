    and complex **deep neural networks**. When training these models, we are often
    confronted with difficult choices in terms of the various parameters we should
    use, such as the number of layers, filter dimensions, the type and order of layers,
    regularization, batch size, learning rate, the number of epochs, and many more.
    And this is not only the case for DNNs – the same challenges arise when we need
    to select the correct preprocessing steps, features, models, and model parameters
    in statistical ML approaches.

    of the non-optimal human choices in ML. This will help you train better models
    faster and more efficiently without manual intervention. First, we will explore
    **hyperparameter optimization** (also called **HyperDrive** in Azure Machine Learning),
    a standard technique for optimizing parameters in an ML process. By evaluating
    different sampling techniques for hyperparameter sampling, such as random sampling,
    grid sampling, and Bayesian optimization, you will learn how to efficiently trade
    model runtime for model performance.

    hyperparameter tuning, and model stacking all in one abstract optimization pipeline.

    store the best model or parameter combination on disk, and then deploy the best

    represent the distribution of the training data to make predictions for unseen
    data from the same distribution. While parametric models (such as linear regression,
    logistic regression, and neural networks) represent the training data distribution
    by using a learned set of parameters, non-parametric models describe the training
    data distribution through other traits, such as decision trees (all tree-based
    classifiers), training samples (k-nearest neighbors), or weighted training samples
    (support vector machine).
  prefs: []

    by a constant number of parameters that are independent of the training data.
    These models make strong assumptions about the training data, so they often require

    very fast.'

    model is astonishing. Have you ever caught yourself manually tweaking a parameter
    in your training processes, such as the number of splits in a decision-based classifier
    or the number of units in a neural network classifier? If so, you are not alone!
    However, it's very important to accept that manually tweaking parameters requires
    deep expertise in the specific model or model configuration. However, we can't
    possibly be an expert in every type of statistical modeling, ML, and optimization
    to tune all the possible parameters manually. Given that the number of parameter
    choices is enormous, it is not feasible to try all possible combinations, so we
    need to find a better way to optimize them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only can we not possibly try all the distinct combinations of parameters
    manually, but in many cases, we also can't possibly predict the outcome of a tweak
    in a hyperparameter, even with expert knowledge. In such scenarios, we can start
    looking at finding the optimal set of parameters automatically. This process is
    called **hyperparameter tuning** or **hyperparameter search**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hyperparameter tuning entails automatically testing a model's performance against
    different sets of hyperparameter combinations and ultimately choosing the best
    combination of hyperparameters. The definition of the *best performance* depends
    on the chosen metric and validation method. For example, stratified-fold cross-validation
    with the f1-score metric will yield a different set of optimal parameters than
    the accuracy metric with k-fold cross-validation.

    Learning later) in this book is that we have a competitive advantage from using
    elastic cloud computing infrastructure. While it is difficult to train hundreds
    of models sequentially on your laptop, it is easy to train thousands of models
    in parallel in the cloud using cheap auto-scaling compute. Using cheap cloud storage,
    we can also persist all potentially good models for later analysis. Many of the
    recent ML papers have shown that we can often achieve better results by using
    more compute power and/or better parameter choices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we begin tuning hyperparameters, we want to remind you of the importance
    of a baseline model. For many practical ML tasks, you should be able to achieve
    good performance using a single tree-based ensemble classifier or a pre-trained
    neural network with default parameters. If this is not the case, hyperparameter
    tuning won't magically output parameters for a top-performing best-in-class model.
    In this case, it would be better to go back to data preprocessing and feature
    engineering to build a better baseline model first, before tuning the batch sizes,
    the number of hidden units, or the number of trees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another issue to avoid with hyperparameter tuning is overfitting and focusing
    on the wrong performance metric or validation method. As with any other optimization
    technique, hyperparameter tuning will yield the best parameter combination for
    a given loss function or metric. Therefore, it is essential to validate your loss
    function before starting hyperparameter tuning.

    not the case for random sampling and Bayesian optimization. For these other methods,
    we sample from a continuous distribution, so the number of training runs won't

    each evaluation only yields a noisy value of the true model performance. Using
    these assumptions, we can use **Gaussian processes** to combine the model evaluations

    the highest expected improvements on this Gaussian. These points will yield new
    samples to test with our model.

    tuning is that the optimization requires each result of each run with the defined

    stopped earlier, which means no accurate metric can be computed.

    an end-to-end ML pipeline is a thorough, complicated, and time-consuming task.
    Even when you can choose the correct model and tuning parameters using Bayesian

    and model optimization through **Automated Machine Learning** Both techniques
    can help you efficiently retrieve the best model for your ML task.

    of tunable parameters is fixed. All the values on a discrete parameter grid are
    evaluated. In **random sampling**, we can apply a continuous distribution for
    the parameter space and select as many parameter choices as we can fit into the
    configured training duration. Random sampling performs better on a large number
    of parameters. Both sampling techniques can/should be tuned using an **early stopping
    criterion**.'

    performance to optimize the following parameter choices. This means that each
    set of parameter choices and the resulting model performance are used to compute
    the next best parameter choices. Therefore, Bayesian optimization uses ML to optimize
    parameter choices for your ML model. Since the underlying Gaussian process requires
    the resulting model performance, early stopping does not work with Bayesian optimization.

- en: We also learned that Automated Machine Learning is a generalization of Bayesian
    optimization on the complete end-to-end ML pipeline. Instead of choosing only
    hyperparameters, we also choose pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection,
    and model stacking methods and optimize those together. Automated Machine Learning
    speeds up this process by predicting which models will perform well on your data
    instead of blindly trying all possible combinations. Both techniques are essential
    for a great ML project; Automated Machine Learning lets you focus on the data
    and labeling first, while hyperparameter tuning lets you optimize a specific model.

    parameters don't fit into the memory of a single machine anymore, and therefore
    distributed learning is required.
