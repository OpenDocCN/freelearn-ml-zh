- en: Data scientists working on productionizing machine learning workloads face a
    breadth of challenges at every step owing to the countless factors involved in
    getting ML models deployed and running. This book offers solutions to common issues,
    detailed explanations of essential concepts, and step-by-step instructions to
    productionize ML workloads using the Azure Machine Learning service. You’ll see
    how data scientists and machine learning engineers working with Microsoft Azure
    can train and deploy ML models at scale by putting their knowledge to work with
    this practical guide.

- en: Throughout the book, you’ll learn how to train, register, and productionize
    ML models by leveraging the power of the Azure Machine Learning service. You’ll
    get to grips with scoring models in real time and batch, explaining models to
    earn business trust, mitigating model bias, and developing solutions using an
    MLOps framework.

- en: By the end of this Azure machine learning book, you’ll be ready to build and
    deploy end-to-end ML solutions into a production system using AML for real-time
    scenarios.
