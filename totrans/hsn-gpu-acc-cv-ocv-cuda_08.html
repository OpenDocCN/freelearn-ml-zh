<p>The last chapter described various computer vision applications that use OpenCV and CUDA. When these applications need to be deployed in real-life situations, there is the need for an embedded development board that can process images at high speed by taking advantage of OpenCV and CUDA. Nvidia provides several GPU-based development boards, such as Jetson TK1, TX1, and TX2, which are ideal for high-end computing tasks such as computer vision. One of these development boards, the Jetson TX1, will be introduced in this chapter. The features and applications with which this board can be used are also discussed in detail. CUDA and OpenCV are essential for computer vision applications, so steps to install them on the Jetson TX1 are discussed in detail.   </p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>

<p>This chapter requires a good understanding of the Linux operating system (OS) and networking. It also requires any Nvidia GPU development board, such as Jetson TK1, TX1, or TX2. The JetPack installation file used in this chapter can be downloaded from the following link: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack">https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack</a>. </p>

<p>When high-end visual computing and computer vision applications need to be deployed in real-life scenarios, then embedded development platforms are required, which can do computationally intensive tasks efficiently. Platforms such as Raspberry Pi can use OpenCV for computer vision applications and camera-interfacing capability, but it is very slow for real-time applications. Nvidia, which specializes in GPU manufacturing, has developed modules that use GPUs for computationally intensive tasks. These modules can be used to deploy computer vision applications on embedded platforms and include Jetson TK1, Jetson TX1, and Jetson TX2. </p>
<p>Jetson TK1 is the preliminary board and contains 192 CUDA cores with the Nvidia Kepler GPU. It is the cheapest of the three. Jetson TX1 is intermediate in terms of processing speed, with 256 CUDA cores with Maxwell architecture, operating at 998 MHz along with ARM CPU. Jetson TX2 is highest in terms of processing speed and price. It comprises 256 CUDA cores with Pascal architecture operating at 1,300 MHz. This chapter will describe Jetson TX1 in detail.</p>

<p>Jetson TX1 is a small system on a module developed specifically for demanding embedded applications. It is Linux-based and offers super-computing performance at the level of teraflops, which can be utilized for computer vision and deep learning applications. The Jetson TX1 module is shown in the following photograph:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-504 image-border" src="img/3fa0208e-3cd3-4e97-b1f3-85b868f9685c.png" style="" width="602" height="299"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The size of the module is 50 x 87 mm, which makes it easy to integrate into any system. Nvidia also offers the Jetson TX1 Development Board, which houses this GPU for prototyping applications in a short amount of time. The whole development kit is shown in the following photograph:</p>

<p>As can be seen from the photograph, apart from the GPU module, the development kit contains a camera module, USB ports, an Ethernet port, a heat sink, fan, and antennas. It is backed by a software ecosystem including JetPack, Linux for Tegra, CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, OpenCV, and VisionWorks. This makes it ideal for developers who are doing research into deep learning and computer vision for rapid prototyping. The features of the Jetson TX1 development kit are explained in detail in the following section.</p>

<div><div><h1 class="header-title">Important features of the Jetson TX1</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Jetson TX1 development kit has many features that make it ideal for super-computing tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a system on a chip built using 20 nm technology, and comprises an ARM Cortex A57 quad-core CPU operating at 1.73 GHz and a 256 core Maxwell GPU operating at 998 Mhz.</li>
<li>It has 4 GB of DDR4 memory with a data bus of 64 bits working at a speed of 1,600 MHz, which is equivalent to 25.6 GB/s.</li>
<li>It contains a 5 MP MIPI CSI-2 camera module. It supports up to six two lane or three four lane cameras at 1,220 MP/s.</li>
<li>The development kit also has a normal USB 3.0 type A port and micro USB port for connecting a mouse, a keyboard, and USB cameras to the board.</li>
<li>It also has an Ethernet port and Wi-Fi connectivity for network connection.</li>
<li>It can be connected to an HDMI display device via the HDMI port.</li>
<li>The kit contains a heat sink and a fan for cooling down the GPU device at its peak performance.</li>
<li>It draws as little as 1 watt of power in an idle condition, around 8-10 watts under normal load, and up to 15 watts when the module is fully utilized. It can process 258 images/second with a power dissipation of 5.7 watts, which is equivalent to the performance/watt value of 45. A normal i7 CPU processor has a performance of 242 images/second at 62.5 watts, which is equivalent to a performance/watt value of 3.88. So Jetson TX1 is 11.5 times better than an i7 processor.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><h1 class="header-title">Installation of JetPack on Jetson TX1</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Jetson TX1 comes with a preinstalled Linux OS. The Nvidia drivers for it should be installed when it is booted for the first time. The commands to do it are as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>cd ${HOME}/NVIDIA-INSTALLER</strong><br/><strong>sudo ./installer.sh</strong></pre>
<p>When TX1 is rebooted after these two commands, the Linux OS with user interface will start. Nvidia offers a <strong>software development kit (SDK)</strong>, which contains all of the software needed for building computer vision and deep learning applications, along with the target OS to flash the development board. This SDK is called <strong>JetPack</strong>. The latest JetPack contains Linux for Tegra (L4T) board support packages; TensorRT, which is used for deep learning inference in computer vision applications; the latest CUDA toolkit, cuDNN, which is a CUDA deep neural network library; VisionWorks, which is also used for computer vision and deep learning applications; and OpenCV. </p>
<p>All of the packages will be installed by default when you install JetPack. This section describes the procedure to install JetPack on the board. The procedure is long, tedious, and a little bit complex for a newcomer to Linux. So, just follow the steps and screenshots given in the following section carefully.</p>

<div><div><h1 class="header-title">Basic requirements for installation</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are a few basic requirements for the installation of JetPack on TX1. JetPack can't be installed directly on the board, so a PC or virtual machine that runs Ubuntu 14.04 is required as a host PC. The installation is not checked with the latest version of Ubuntu, but you are free to play around with it. The Jetson TX1 board needs peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard, and monitor, which can be connected to the USB and HDMI ports. The Jetson TX1 board should be connected to the same router as the host machine via an Ethernet cable. The installation will also require a micro USB to USB cable to connect the board with a PC for transferring packages on the board via serial transfer. Note down the IP address of the board by checking the router configuration. If all requirements are satisfied, then move to the following section for the installation of JetPack.</p>
