<p class="mce-root">Google Cloud ML Engine combines the services of Google Cloud Platform with the power and flexibility of TensorFlow. With this book, you will not only learn how to build and train different complexities of machine learning models at scale, but also to host them in the cloud to make predictions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book is focused on making the most of the Google Machine Learning Platform for large datasets and complex problems. You will learn how to create powerful machine-learning-based applications from scratch for a wide variety of problems by leveraging different data services from the Google Cloud Platform. Applications include NLP, speech-to-text, reinforcement learning, time series, recommender systems, image classification, video content inference, and many others. We will implement a wide variety of deep learning use cases and will also make extensive use of data-related services comprising the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem, such as Firebase, Storage APIs, Datalab, and so forth. This will enable you to integrate machine learning and data processing features into your web and mobile applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this book, you will be aware of the main difficulties that you may encounter, and be familiar with appropriate strategies to overcome these difficulties and build efficient systems.</p>

<p>This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and AI developers who want to learn Google Cloud Platform services to build machine learning applications. Since interaction with the Google ML platform is mostly done via the command line, the reader should have some familiarity with the bash shell and Python scripting. Some understanding of machine learning and data science concepts will also be handy.</p>

<p>In this book, machine learning algorithms are implemented on the Google Cloud Platform. To reproduce the many examples in this book, you need to possess a working account on GCP. <span>We have used Python 2.7 and above to build various applications.</span> <span>In that spirit, we have tried to keep all of the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use it in different scenarios.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Where</span><span> </span><kbd>GROUP</kbd><span> </span><span>is a service or an account element and</span><span> </span><kbd>COMMAND</kbd><span> </span><span>is the command to send to the</span><span> </span><kbd>GROUP</kbd><span>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>import matplotlib.patches as patches<br/>import numpy as np<br/>fig,ax = plt.subplots(1)</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>text="this is a good text"<br/>from google.cloud.language_v1 import <strong>types</strong><br/>document = types.<strong>Document</strong>(<br/>        content=<strong>text</strong>,<br/>        type='PLAIN_TEXT')</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="line"><strong><span><span class="syntax--text syntax--plain"><span class="syntax--meta syntax--paragraph syntax--text">$ gcloud compute instances list</span></span></span></strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "</span>Click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Create a new project.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
