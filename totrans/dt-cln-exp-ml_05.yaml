- en: Anyone who has done a log transformation of a target, or scaled a feature, appreciates
    just how critical to our analysis preprocessing can be. Raise your hand if you
    were ever confident that your model approximated truth, but then tried a fairly
    obvious transformation and appreciated just how far from truth your original model
    was. Encoding, transforming, and scaling data is not a gimmick, though sometimes
    people have that impression. We apply that preprocessing because 1) it gets us
    closer to capturing a real-world process and 2) because many machine learning
    algorithms just work better with scaled data.

- en: Feature selection is equally important. A good adage is never build a model
    with N features, when N - 1 features will do just as nicely. It is worth remembering
    that this is more complicated than having too many features. There are times when
    having 3 features is too many and others when having 103 features is perfectly
    fine. The issue is really whether the features are too correlated for their independent
    impact on the target to be disentangled. When that is not the case, the risks
    of overfitting and of unstable results increase substantially. We pay careful
    attention to feature selection in this part of the book and subsequently.

- en: The chapter on model evaluation in this part prepares us for the work we will
    be doing in the rest of the book. We explore in detail the evaluation of both
    regression and classification models, those with continuous and categorical targets
    respectively. We also learn how to construct pipelines and do cross-validation.
    Most importantly, we learn about data leakage and how to avoid it.
