- en: '**Amplitude**: Sound is made up of waves, and the height of those waves is
    called the amplitude. The bigger the amplitude, the louder the sound. Amplitude
    refers to the maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation, measured from the
    position of equilibrium. Imagine a swinging pendulum. The distance the pendulum
    moves from its resting position (middle point) to one extreme is its amplitude.
    Think of a person on a swing. The higher they swing, the greater the amplitude
    of their motion.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**RMS calculation**: To find the loudness using RMS, we square the amplitude
    values of the sound waves. This is done because it helps us focus on the positive
    values (removing any negative values) and because loudness should reflect the
    intensity of the sound.'
  prefs:

    (mean) of these squared values. It’s like finding the typical size of the sound
    waves.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    root of that average power. This is the RMS, which tells us how intense the sound
    is on average.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**RMS energy**: In practical terms, when you look at a loudness value given
    in **decibels** (**dB**), it’s often calculated from the RMS energy. A higher
    RMS value means a louder sound, while a lower RMS value means a quieter sound.'
  prefs:

    them to focus on their intensity, find the average of these squared values, and

    a useful tool for understanding and comparing the loudness of different audio
    signals.

    sound, such as a bass drum. Think of ocean waves hitting the shore. The more waves

    the concept of waveforms, sample rates, and the discrete nature of audio. These
    fundamentals provide the building blocks for audio analysis. We analyzed the difference
    between spectrograms and mel spectrograms in audio analysis and visualized how
    audio signals change over time and how they relate to human perception. Visualization
    is a powerful way to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of audio.
    With the knowledge and techniques gained in this chapter, we are better equipped
    to explore the realms of speech recognition, music classification, and countless
    other applications where sound takes center stage.
