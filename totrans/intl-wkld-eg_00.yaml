- en: The **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) has transformed how businesses think about
    and interact with the world. Sensors can measure the performance of high-volume
    industrial manufacturing operations or the daily environmental health of a remote
    island. The IoT makes it possible to study the world at various levels of precision
    and enable data-driven decision making anywhere. **Machine learning** (**ML**)
    and Elastic cloud computing have accelerated our ability to understand and analyze
    the huge amount of data generated by the IoT. With edge computing, data analytics
    and ML models can process information locally at the source where the data is
    generated.

- en: This book will teach you to combine the technologies of edge computing and machine
    learning to deliver next-generation cyber-physical outcomes. You'll begin by discovering
    how to create software applications that run on edge devices using software from
    Amazon Web Services, such as AWS IoT Greengrass. As you advance, you'll learn
    how to process and stream IoT data from the edge to the cloud and use it to train
    ML models using Amazon SageMaker. The book also shows you how to optimize these
    models and run them at the edge for optimal performance, cost savings, and data
    compliance.

    the power of machine learning to the edge, and operate those workloads in a production
    setting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need a personal computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux. This computer
    uses the AWS Command Line Interface in a terminal and the AWS Management Console
    through a web browser. A second, Linux-based system acts as the edge device and
    hosts the edge solution running AWS IoT Greengrass. This second system can be
    a local or remote virtual machine or an actual device like a Raspberry Pi. For
    the real IoT experience, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi 3B (or later) with
    a SenseHAT expansion board to complete the hands-on portions of the book. If you
    do not have a hardware device, you can use an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine instead.
    Ultimately, you can finish all hands-on steps with or without a second device.

    access to an AWS account or create one yourself. Completion of all hands-on sections
    can accrue billing up to $25 US Dollars (USD). You can opt out of the ML training
    steps to reduce the cost to less than $5\.
