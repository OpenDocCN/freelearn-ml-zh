			<p>Machine learning software depends on data much more than other types of software. In order to make use of statistical learning, we need to collect, process, and prepare data for the development of machine learning models. The data needs to be representative of the problems that the software solves and the services it provides, not only during development but also during operations. In this part of the book, we focus on the data â€“ how we can acquire it and how we make it useful for the training, testing, and deployment of machine <span class="No-Break">learning models.</span></p>
