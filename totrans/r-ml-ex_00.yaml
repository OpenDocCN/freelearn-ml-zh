- en: Data science and machine learning are some of the top buzzwords in the technical
    world today. From retail stores to Fortune 500 companies, everyone is working
    hard to make machine learning give them data-driven insights to grow their businesses.
    With powerful data manipulation features, machine learning packages, and an active
    developer community, R empowers users to build sophisticated machine learning
    systems to solve real-world data problems.

    *Predicting Customer Shopping Trends with Market Basket Analysis*, starts off
    with our first project, e-commerce product recommendations, predictions, and pattern
    analysis, using various machine learning techniques. This chapter specifically
    deals with market basket analysis and association rule mining to detect customer
    shopping patterns and trends and make product predictions and suggestions using
    these techniques. These techniques are used widely by retail companies and e-commerce
    stores such as Target, Macy''s, Flipkart, and Amazon for product recommendations.'

    System*, covers the second part of our first project on e-commerce product recommendations,
    predictions, and pattern analysis. This chapter specifically deals with analyzing
    e-commerce product reviews and ratings by different users, using algorithms and
    techniques such as user-collaborative filtering to design a recommender system
    that is production ready.'

    Risk Detection and Prediction – Descriptive Analytics*, starts off with our second
    project, applying machine learning to a complex financial scenario where we deal
    with credit risk detection and prediction. This chapter specifically deals with
    introducing the main objective, looking at a financial credit dataset for 1,000
    people who have applied for loans from a bank. We will use machine learning techniques
    to detect people who are potential credit risks and may not be able to repay a
    loan if they take it from the bank, and also predict the same for the future.
    The chapter will also talk in detail about our dataset, the main challenges when
    dealing with data, the main features of the dataset, and exploratory and descriptive
    analytics on the data. It will conclude with the best machine learning techniques
    suitable for tackling this problem.'

    "Chapter 6. Credit Risk Detection and Prediction – Predictive Analytics"), *Credit
    Risk Detection and Prediction – Predictive Analytics*, starts from where we left
    off in the previous chapter about descriptive analytics with looking at using
    predictive analytics. Here, we specifically deal with using several machine learning
    algorithms to detect and predict which customers would be potential credit risks
    and might not be likely to repay a loan to the bank if they take it. This would
    ultimately help the bank make data-driven decisions as to whether to approve the
    loan or not. We will be covering several supervised learning algorithms and compare
    their performance. Different metrics for evaluating the efficiency and accuracy
    of various machine learning algorithms will also be covered here.'

    – Analyzing Twitter Data*, introduces the world of social media analytics. We
    begin with an introduction to the world of social media and the process of collecting
    data through Twitter''s APIs. The chapter will walk you through the process of
    mining useful information from tweets, including visualizing Twitter data with
    real-world examples, clustering and topic modeling of tweets, the present challenges
    and complexities, and strategies to address these issues. We show by example how
    some powerful measures can be computed using Twitter data.'

    Data*, builds upon the knowledge of Twitter APIs to work on a project for analyzing
    sentiments in tweets. This project presents multiple machine learning algorithms
    for the classification of tweets based on the sentiments inferred. This chapter
    will also present these results in a comparative manner and help you understand
    the workings and difference in results of these algorithms.'
