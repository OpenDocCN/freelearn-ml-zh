    object detection module. With the sample code included, it is possible to use
    Cascade and Latent SVM detectors as well as create custom cascade detectors for
    a specific object detection application. Additionally, the new Scene Text Detector
    included in OpenCV 3 is explained in the chapter.

- en: Object detection deals with the process of locating instances of a certain class
    of real-world objects, such as faces, cars, pedestrians, and buildings in images
    or videos. Detection algorithms typically start by extracting features from two
    sets of images. One of these sets contains images from the desired object and
    the other one contains background images where the searched object is not present.
    Then, the detector is trained based on these features to recognize future instances
    of the object class.

    in medicine, require searching for the object in many image patches. However,
    examining all image zones and computing the feature set for each zone are time-consuming
    tasks. Cascade detectors are widely used because of their high efficiency in doing

- en: Cascade detectors consist of various boosting stages. The boosting algorithm
    selects the best feature set to create and combine a number of weak tree classifiers.
    Thus, boosting is not only a detector but also a feature selection method. Each
    stage is usually trained to detect nearly 100 percent of objects correctly and
    discard at least 50 percent of the background images. Therefore, background images,
    which represent a larger number of images, need less processing time as they are
    discarded at the early stages of the cascade. Moreover, the concluding cascade
    stages use more features than earlier stages, and even then only objects and difficult
    background images require more time to be evaluated.

    Gradients** (**HOG**) features together with the different boosting algorithms.

    detector included in OpenCV since Version 2.4.4\. The code can be found in the

    detector, `haarcascade_smile.xml`, can be found in `OPENCV_SCR/data/haarcascades`.
    This code first detects the frontal face using the pretrained cascade stored in
    `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` and then detects the smiling mouth pattern at
    the bottom part of the image. Finally, the intensity of the smile is calculated
    based on the number of neighbors detected.

- en: Latent SVM is a detector that uses HOG features and a star-structured, part-based
    model consisting of a root filter and a set of part filters to represent an object
    category. HOGs are feature descriptors that are obtained by counting the occurrences
    of gradient orientations in localized portions of an image. On the other hand,
    a variant of **support vector machines** (**SVM**) classifiers are used in this
    detector to train models using partially labeled data. The basic idea of an SVM
    is constructing a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in high-dimensional space.
    These hyperplanes are obtained to have the largest distance to the nearest training
    data point (functional margin in order to achieve low generalization errors).
    Like cascade detectors, Latent SVM uses a sliding window with different initial
    positions and scales where the algorithm is applied in order to detect if there
    is an object inside.

- en: Cascade detectors have been widely used in several applications such as face
    recognition and pedestrian detection because they are fast and provide good results.
    Soft cascades are a variant of the classic cascade detectors. This new type of
    cascades is implemented in OpenCV 3 in the `softcascade` module. Soft cascade
    is trained with AdaBoost but the resulting detector is composed of only one stage.
    This stage has several weak classifiers that are evaluated in sequence. After
    evaluating each weak classifier, the result is compared with the corresponding
    threshold. Similar to the evaluation process carried out in multistage cascades,
    negative non-object instances are discarded as soon as possible.

    3的`softcascade`模块中实现。软级联使用AdaBoost进行训练，但生成的检测器仅由一个阶段组成。这个阶段有几个弱分类器，它们按顺序进行评估。在评估每个弱分类器后，结果将与相应的阈值进行比较。与多阶段级联中进行的评估过程类似，一旦评估出负的非目标实例，就会尽快将其丢弃。
