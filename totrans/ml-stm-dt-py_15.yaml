    of machine learning on streaming data, using mainly online models. In this last
    chapter, it is time for a recapitulative overview of all that has been seen throughout
    the eleven earlier chapters of the book.

    companies. The famous saying goes: "Garbage in, garbage out," implying that when
    you do machine learning on garbage data, your outputs will also be useless. Thorough
    data exploration needs to be done on any new business case that comes to you,
    allowing you to identify potential problems. Data quality processes are often
    needed but not yet in place. Although out of scope for the data scientist, you
    can advise on the need and added value of such processes.'

- en: Many data scientists have a mathematics, statistics, or programming background
    and often have an operational mindset. Something that regularly goes wrong in
    business cases is that technical people start doing what is technically the best
    and start sidetracking the lines defined by business projects. Although this is
    very understandable, it is important to always keep in mind why companies are
    investing in a specific technology, which is, 99% of the time, to make a return
    on investing. When working in tech, it is important to keep in mind whether your
    technical topics are helping the company to reach its objectives, as you may lose
    funding quickly in the opposite case.

    able to prove to your company's leaders that you are indeed making them money
    or reaching their goals. To prove this, metrics are your best friend. As long
    as you define your project's key performance indicators from the outset and throughout,
    you can assure continuing support for your project, allowing you to work on cutting-edge
    technology.

- en: Long-term successful projects will at some point be evaluated in terms of your
    company's best practices. If you want to ensure you have long-term relevance to
    your company, you need to make sure to keep in mind what your company is doing
    on a general level and make sure that what you do is compatible with this. Allowing
    incompatibility with the overall architecture is to set yourself up for failure.

- en: When projects become large, it may become difficult to maintain a full overview
    of everything that is running in your production environment. In the same way,
    as business metrics are used, you can set up technical metrics that help you keep
    a quick and easy overview of all the things you have and how they are doing. The
    larger your projects become, the more important monitoring will be, but the harder
    it will be to implement. The best practice is therefore to implement monitoring
    as soon as possible.

- en: Many data scientists and machine learning engineers are technology enthusiasts
    with our own ideas and vision on how to implement certain functionalities. One
    thing to keep in mind, though, is to avoid reinventing the wheel. When solutions
    already exist, be it in the company or outside, it is often useful to investigate
    whether it is possible to reuse them instead of "re-inventing the wheel" by developing
    the exact same functionality again.
