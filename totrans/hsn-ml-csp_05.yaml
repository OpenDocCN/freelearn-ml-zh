    the time. But what does it really mean, and could it mean more than one thing?
    We are about to find out just that. We will use fuzzy logic to help guide an autonomous
    vehicle around an obstacle course, and if we do it correctly, we will avoid obstacles
    along the way. Our **automated guided vehicle** (**AGV**) will navigate its way
    around the obstacle course, sensing for obstacles in its path. It will use an
    inference system to help guide it along. You, the user, will be able to create
    obstacles or throughways, which the AGV either must avoid or can utilize. You
    can watch the tracking beams work as well as track the path of the AGV along its
    course. Each step the AGV takes will be updated on the user interface so that
    you can see what is going on.'

    What many people do not know is that there is also what is known as **many-valued
    logic**, where the truth lies somewhere between 1 and 0\. Fuzzy logic is a conceptual
    implementation of many-valued logic that handles partial truth. What many people
    also do not know is that the famous sigmoid function, which you will hear of later,
    in our chapter on activation functions, is a fuzzification method.

    by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three "truth
    values"-one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents
    a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the
    red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as "not hot". The
    orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as "slightly warm" and the blue
    arrow (pointing at 0.8) "fairly cold"."'

    about to delve into. Why do we show this? Because our first example is going to
    show exactly this. To illustrate fuzzy logic, we will be using the AForge.NET
    open source machine learning framework. For a user, it is an excellent framework
    to show how easy it is to use the inference engine to accomplish tasks.

    `InferenceSystem` object, we should probably start first by telling you a little
    bit about what such a system is. A fuzzy inference system is a model capable of
    executing fuzzy computing. This is accomplished using a database, linguistic variables
    and a rule base, all of which can be in memory. The typical operation of a fuzzy
    inference system is as follows:'

    the center of the area of our shape to obtain the numerical representation of
    the output. It uses numerical approximation, so several intervals will be chosen.

    taking our machine learning repertoire to the next level. If you remember your
    art classes from elementary school, this chapter is sure to bring back memories!
