- en: Machine learning and neural networks are fast becoming pillars on which you
    can build intelligent applications. The book begins by introducing you to Python
    and discussing the use of AI search algorithms. You will learn math-heavy topics,
    such as regression and classification, illustrated by Python examples.

- en: You will then progress on to advanced AI techniques and concepts, and work on
    real-life datasets to form decision trees and clusters. You will be introduced
    to neural networks, which are a powerful tool benefiting from Moore's law being
    applied to 21st-century computing power. By the end of this book, you will feel
    confident and will look forward to building your own AI applications with your
    newly-acquired skills!

    scientist or who want to use machine learning to enrich their current personal
    or professional projects. Prior experience of AI is not needed, however, knowledge
    of at least one programming language (preferably Python) and high school-level
    math is required. Although this is a beginner-level book on AI, intermediate students
    will benefit from improving their Python by implementing practical applications,
    using and refreshing their fundamental AI knowledge.
