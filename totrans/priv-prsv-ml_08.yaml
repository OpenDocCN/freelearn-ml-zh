- en: We highlight the importance of FL as a privacy-preserving approach to machine
    learning and emphasize the need for FL in scenarios where data cannot be centrally
    aggregated due to privacy concerns or regulatory restrictions. Furthermore, we
    discuss the implementation of FL using open source frameworks, which provide accessible
    and customizable tools for deploying FL algorithms and models.

- en: We explore the significance of FL benchmarks for evaluating and comparing FL
    algorithms and techniques and emphasize the need for standardized benchmarks to
    assess the performance and effectiveness of FL models across different scenarios.
    By leveraging FL benchmarks, researchers and practitioners can identify the strengths
    and limitations of various FL approaches, facilitating advancements in the field.
