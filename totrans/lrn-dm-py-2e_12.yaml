    with high runtimes need to be improved or discarded, while simpler algorithms
    that can deal with more samples are becoming more popular to use. As an example,

    increases. Today''s multi-gigabyte-sized hard drives will turn into exabyte-sized
    drives in a few years, and network throughput traffic will be increasing as well.

- en: '**Velocity**: While related to volume, the velocity of data is increasing too.
    Modern cars have hundreds of sensors that stream data into their computers, and
    information from these sensors needs to be analyzed at a sub-second level to operate
    the car. It isn''t just a case of finding answers in the volume of data; those
    answers often need to come quickly. In some cases, we also simply do not have
    enough disk space to store data, meaning we also need to make decisions on what
    data to keep for later analysis.'

    the datasets that we have these days. Consider a social media post that may have
    text, photos, user mentions, likes, comments, videos, geographic information,

    whether the data is being correctly collected—whether it is outdated, noisy, contains
    outliers—or generally whether it is useful at all. Being able to trust the data

    of working with data is often more difficult—let alone the analysis. While there

- en: The algorithms we have used so far in the book load the dataset into memory
    and then work on the in-memory version. This gives a large benefit in terms of
    speed of computation (because using computer memory is faster than using hard
    drives), as it is much faster to compute on in-memory data than having to load
    a sample before we use it. In addition, in-memory data allows us to iterate over
    the data many times, thereby improving our machine learning model.

- en: In big data, we can't load our data into memory. In many ways, this is a good

    Probabilities in Naive Bayes models are often quite small. Multiplying small values,
    which is necessary for many statistical values, can lead to an underflow error
    where the computer's precision isn't good enough and just makes the whole value
    0\. In this case, it would cause the likelihoods for both genders to be zero,
    leading to incorrect predictions.
  id: totrans-197
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get around this, we use log probabilities. For two values a and b, *log(a× b)*
    is equal to *log(a) + log(b)*. The log of a small probability is a negative value,
    but a relatively large one. For instance, log(0.00001) is about -11.5\. This means
    that rather than multiplying actual probabilities and risking an underflow error,
    we can sum the log probabilities and compare the values in the same way (higher
    numbers still indicate a higher likelihood).
  id: totrans-198
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to obtain probabilities back from the log probabilities, make sure
    to undo the log operation by using e to the power of the value you are interested
    in. To revert -11.5 into the probability, take e^(-11.5), which equals 0.00001
    (approximately).
  id: totrans-199
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One problem with using log probabilities is that they don't handle zero values
    well (although, neither does multiplying by zero probabilities). This is due to
    the fact that log(0) is undefined. In some implementations of Naive Bayes, a 1
    is added to all counts to get rid of this, but there are other ways to address
    this. This is a simple form of smoothing of the values. In our code, we just return
    a very small value if the word hasn't been seen for our given gender.
