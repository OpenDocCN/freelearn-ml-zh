- en: Robotics is an emerging field with applications in every walk of life. Robotics,
    and the associated technology, appear to be confined to the well-equipped laboratories
    of universities and high-tech companies. However, many of the aspects of robotics
    – building them and programming them – can be learned and practiced in your own
    home.

    part fabrication, and assembly of hardware. It introduces some starting digital
    electronics, such as connections and data buses. It aims to dig a little deeper
    into the sensors and the code needed to make interesting behaviors using them.

    This is an experience of technology that replaces impenetrable magic with real-world
    experience and confidence to build more – anyone with practice can become a robotics
    wizard too.

    introduction to designing, building, and programming robots, using the popular
    Python programming language. It is also for those who would like to gain an introduction
    to 3D CAD, robotics sensors, robotics hardware, and robotics behaviors that make
    use of the sensors and hardware.

    Pi Pico*, introduces Raspberry Pi Pico in relation to other robotics main controllers.
    It shows the advantages of the CircuitPython programming environment and takes
    you through making an overview plan for a robot build built around Pico. The chapter
    provides a robot hardware shopping list for the first half of the book, discussing
    the parts and trade-offs in choosing them.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18001_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041), *Preparing Raspberry Pi Pico*,
    takes you through getting CircuitPython onto Pico, then taking your first steps
    in writing code with it. It will also cover soldering headers onto Raspberry Pi
    Pico so it can connect to robot parts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18001_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055), *Designing a Robot Chassis
    in FreeCAD*, introduces FreeCAD while turning the overview plan into 3D CAD designs.
    It shows you how to make drawings from the design for building the robot parts.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18001_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor080), *Building a Robot around Pico*,
    shows how you can use CAD drawings with hand tools to craft robot parts by cutting
    and drilling sheet plastic. It guides you in assembling the parts then wiring
    and connecting the electronics. This chapter is where the robot is first powered
    on!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18001_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098), *Driving Motors with Raspberry
    Pi Pico*, introduces you to controlling motors with CircuitPython and Raspberry
    Pi Pico, showing how motors can be used to make line motions and turns and how
    speed can be controlled. The chapter then shows you how to pull these together
    into programmed motion sequences.'

    encoders, showing you how to detect wheel movement in code. The chapter covers
    the Raspberry Pi Pico PIO peripheral as a powerful way to manage these sensors.'

    More Devices*, prepares you for the next section of the book with distance sensors,
    Bluetooth LE, and an **inertial measurement unit** (**IMU**), with further advice
    on choosing the devices and how they will be attached. The chapter provides a

    and calibrating it. You will use the IMU with the PID algorithm for a behavior
    that makes a robot always face north. Finally, the chapter shows you how to program
    the robot to make a specified turn using the IMU.'

    Monte Carlo*, will show you how to program a robot to determine where it is likely
    to be in an arena. You’ll use plans in the chapter to build a foam board arena
    and model this arena in code. You are shown how to visualize this space on a computer
    using Bluetooth LE with Matplotlib. You will then learn about moving robot poses
    based on sensor input. The chapter shows how multiple robot behaviors can cooperate
    in the same application. You will be introduced to using probability algorithms
    in robot motion, making predictions, and refining them.'

    information on digging deeper into each of them. The chapter provides ideas and
    research areas for you to extend all the aspects of the robot, and then further
    suggestions to build more ambitious robots and grow your skills. The chapter also
    recommends robotics communities you could participate in.'

    conditionals, and functions. A well-lit and ventilated desk space is recommended
    for the robot-building aspects of the book. Access to hand tools will help, although
    you will be shown which tools to shop for. The robot code examples have been tested
    on CircuitPython 7.2.0 on Raspberry Pi Pico but should work with later versions.
    The computer code examples were tested on Python 3.9.
