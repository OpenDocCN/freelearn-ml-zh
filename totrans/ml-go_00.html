<p>It seems like machine learning and artificial intelligence is all the rage, both in hip tech companies and increasingly in larger enterprise companies. Data scientists are using machine learning to do everything from drive cars to draw cats. However, if you follow the data science community, you have very likely seen something like <em>language wars</em> unfold between Python and R users. These languages dominate the machine learning conversation and often seem to be the only choices to integrate machine learning in your organization. We will explore a third option in this book: Go, the open source programming language created at Google.</p>
<p><span>The unique features of Go, along with the mindset of Go programmers, can help data scientists overcome some of the common struggles that they encounter. In particular, data scientists are (unfortunately) known to produce bad, inefficient, and unmaintainable code. This book will address this issue, and will clearly show you how to be productive in machine learning while also producing applications that maintain a high level of integrity. It will also allow you to overcome the common challenges of integrating analysis and machine learning code within an existing engineering organization.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">This book will develop readers into productive, innovative data analysts who leverage Go to build robust and valuable applications. To this end, the book will clearly introduce the technical, programming aspects of machine learning in Go, but it will also guide the reader to understand sound workflows and philosophies for real-world analysis.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Preparing and analyzing data in machine learning workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="4f556f8e-6876-48ca-9ac5-f897b733e23e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Gathering and Organizing Data</em>, covers the gathering, organization, and parsing of data to/from a local and remote sources. Once the reader is done with this chapter, they will understand how to interact with data stored in various places and in various formats, how to parse and clean that data, and how to output that cleaned and parsed data.</li>
<li><a href="5e7af3cb-ce60-4699-b2d3-7eeff8978a9e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Matrices, Probability, and Statistics</em>, covers the organization of data into matrices and matrix operations. Once the reader is done with this material, they will understand how to form matrices within Go programs and how to utilize these matrices to perform various types of matrix operations. This chapter also covers statistical measures and operations key to day-to-day data analysis work. Once the reader is done with this chapter, they will understand how to perform solid summary data analysis, describe and visualize distributions, quantify hypotheses, and transform datasets with, for example, dimensionality reductions.</li>
<li><a href="64db3465-cd9a-42ca-b0fb-d54c59b87037.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Evaluation and Validation</em>, covers evaluation and validation, which are key to measuring the performance of machine applications and ensuring that they generalize. Once the reader is done with this chapter, they will understand various metrics to gauge the performance of models (in other words, <strong>evaluate</strong> the model) as well as various techniques to validate the model more generally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Machine learning techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="c5c610c4-4e25-4e09-9150-b25c4b69720e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Regression</em>, explains regression, a widely used technique to model continuous variables and a basis for other models. Regression produces models that are immediately interpretable. Thus, it can provide an excellent starting point when introducing predictive capabilities in a organization.</li>
<li><a href="f0ffd10e-d2c4-41d7-8f26-95c05a30d818.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Classification</em>, covers classification, a machine learning technique distinct from regression in that the target variable is typically categorical or labeled. For example, a classification model may classify emails into spam and not spam categories or classify network traffic as fraudulent or not fraudulent.</li>
<li><a href="5440ef77-1e06-4c0e-b16e-5cb264a0baca.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Clustering</em>, covers clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique used to form groupings of samples. At the end of this chapter, readers will be able to automatically form groupings of data points to better understand their structure.</li>
<li><a href="2811c1b4-f938-4319-a031-3d665968164c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Time Series and Anomaly Detection</em>, introduces techniques utilized to model time series data, such as stock prices, user events, and so on. After reading this chapter, the reader will understand how to evaluate various terms in a time series, build up a model of the time series, and detect anomalies in a time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking machine learning to the next level:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="3e51d99f-2f6a-4d4b-876f-3b44f74b9a20.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</em>, introduces techniques utilized to perform regression, classification, and image processing with neural networks. After reading this chapter, the reader will understand how and when to apply these more complicated modeling techniques.</li>
<li><a href="3acd1023-154a-4708-826e-58a5e4839a76.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Deploying and Distributing Analyses and Models</em>, empowers readers to deploy the models that we have developed throughout the class to production environments and distribute processing over production scale data. This chapter illustrates how both of these things can be done easily, without significant modifications to the code utilized throughout the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="718ca26d-465a-47c9-91b9-14e749be0c30.xhtml">Appendix</a>, <em>Algorithms/Techniques Related to Machine Learning</em>, can be referenced throughout the text of the book and will provide information about algorithms, optimizations, and techniques that are relevant to machine learning workflows.</p>

<p><span>Many Go code snippets will not include</span> <kbd>package main</kbd> <span>and <kbd>func main() {}</kbd></span><span>. It is assumed that Go code snippets are compiled within this necessary structure, unless otherwise noted. It will also be assumed throughout the book that code example are compiled in a directory call</span> <kbd>myprogram</kbd> <span>and thus compiled to a</span> <kbd>myprogram</kbd> <span>binary. The reader will recognize, however, that the code could be copied to any folder in your</span> <kbd>GOPATH/src</kbd> <span>directory and/or compiled to a binary named according to the reader's preference.</span></p>
<p><span>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>The next lines of code read the link and assign it to the to the</span> <kbd>BeautifulSoup</kbd> <span>function.</span>" A block of code is set as follows:</span></p>
<pre>#import packages into the project 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
from urllib.request import urlopen 
import pandas as pd</pre>
<p><span>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</span></p>
<pre><span> [default] exten =&gt; s,1,<strong>Dial</strong>(Zap/1|30)<br/> exten =&gt; s,2,<strong>Voicemail</strong>(u100)<br/> exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(<strong>b100</strong>) <br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0) </span></pre>
<p><span>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</span></p>
<pre><strong>C:\Python34\Scripts&gt; pip install -upgrade pip</strong>
<strong>C:\Python34\Scripts&gt; pip install pandas</strong></pre>
<p><span><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "<span>In order to download new modules, we will go to</span> <span class="packt_screen">Files</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project Name</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project Interpreter</span><span>.</span>"</span></p>
