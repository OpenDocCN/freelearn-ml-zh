An increasing number of people have been exposed to the term and are looking at how to leverage big data in their own businesses, to improve sales and profitability. However, collecting, aggregating, and visualizing data is just one part of the equation. Being able to extract useful information from data is another task, and much more challenging.</p><p class="calibre7">Traditionally, most researchers perform statistical analysis using historical samples of data. The main downside of this process is that conclusions drawn from statistical analysis are limited. In fact, researchers usually struggle to uncover hidden patterns and unknown correlations from target data. Aside from applying statistical analysis, machine learning has emerged as an alternative. This process yields a more accurate predictive model with the data inserted into a learning algorithm. Through machine learning, the analysis of business operations and processes is not limited to human-scale thinking. Machine-scale analysis enables businesses to discover hidden values in big data.</p><p class="calibre7">The most widely used tool for machine learning and data analysis is the R language. In addition to being the most popular language used by data scientists, R is open source and is free for use for all users. The R programming language offers a variety of learning packages and visualization functions, which enable users to analyze data on the fly. Any user can easily perform machine learning with R on their dataset without knowing every detail of the mathematical models behind the analysis.</p><p class="calibre7">
<span class="strong"><em class="calibre8">Machine Learning with R Cookbook</em></span> takes a practical approach to teaching you how to perform machine learning with R. Each of the 12 chapters are introduced to you by dividing this topic into several simple recipes. Through the step-by-step instructions provided in each recipe, the reader can construct a predictive model by using a variety of machine learning packages.</p><p class="calibre7">In this book, readers are first directed how to set up the R environment and use simple R commands to explore data. The next topic covers how to perform statistical analysis with machine learning analysis and assessing created models, which are covered in detail later on in the book. There is also content on learning how to integrate R and Hadoop to create a big data analysis platform. The detailed illustrations provide all the information required to start applying machine learning to individual projects.</p><p class="calibre7">With <span class="strong"><em class="calibre8">Machine Learning with R Cookbook</em></span>, users will feel that machine learning has never been easier.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre11" id="calibre_pb_1"/>
