                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) requires massive computational power and, hence, requires specialized processors. But if the power of ML can be brought to mobile devices that lack such processing power and also work in offline mode, there will be enormous opportunities and an entire new business category with a whole gamut of innovative useful mobile applications that are very hard to imagine otherwise. The entire way customers and businesses connect with each other would be reshaped.</p>
<p>Mobile devices have become extended organs of human beings these days. It is hard to find anyone without a mobile phone with them always. If a mobile phone is going to be a part of the human being, then, just as the eyes, nose, legs, and so on know what we do daily and have got accustomed to our lifestyle, in a similar manner, mobile phones can <span>also</span> <span>understand the ins and outs of our daily routine and can bring out so many key data points, which we may not have had the time to analyze ourselves.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, a mobile device can have so many applications installed on it by different organizations that it is easy for third parties to get a deeper insight into our lifestyle, life pattern, and deep secrets, and take many different actions based on the key pointers gathered. There may be possibilities that not only benefit these third parties, but may also benefit us. They can try to make us aware of things that we were ignorant of as regards ourselves or suggest better ways to perform certain activities we do, thus improving our life overall. The possibilities are infinite and left to our imagination on how <span>ML</span> in mobile can be achieved and implemented. </p>
<p>We are also seeing an internet of things explosion. This is another dimension, where <span>ML</span> in mobile devices becomes key. The sensors sending out different information from time to time can be kept close to the sensor, rather than transmitting all the way to a server. Different protocols could be used to communicate between the sensors and mobile devices for such data exchange and timely actions could be taken swiftly. Here, again, the possibilities are innumerable, ground<span>breaking innovations are happening, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to gain insights into the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key <span>ML</span> mobile applications </li>
<li>Key innovation areas</li>
<li>Opportunities for stakeholders—what are the key stakeholders in the mobile <span>ML</span> ecosystem doing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Mobile applications with ML intelligence can have various use cases in the e-commerce sector. One such example is indoor navigation applications in retail stores that improve business.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><strong>Indoor navigation</strong><span> deals with<strong> </strong></span><strong>navigation within buildings</strong><span>. Because GPS reception is normally non-existent inside buildings, other positioning technologies are used here when automatic positioning is desired. Wi-Fi or beacons (<strong>Bluetooth Low Energy</strong> (<strong>BLE</strong>)) are often used in this case to create a so-called </span><strong>indoor GPS</strong><span>. Unlike GPS, however, they also enable you to determine the actual floor level. Most applications require an indoor routing functionality that guides people precisely through a building using an indoor navigation app and, in this way, automatically determines their position—very similar to the navigation systems that we use in our cars.</span></div>
<p>In many top e-commerce sites, product recommendations are provided when we purchase a certain product. This is done based on browsing history, purchase history, user query understanding, ranking, and user favorite determination, coupled with user situation, location, preferences, and constraints.</p>
<p>In e-commerce, trend prediction and taking immediate steps as per trends observed play a huge role in sales. The gaps between the two can largely be fixed by ML algorithms efficiently.</p>

<p>The energy sector is one sector where, if ML is applied, it could bring in lot of savings to energy spend, thereby protecting the environment and helping us go green.</p>
<p>Machine learning-enabled smart homes that can be controlled based on user preferences and availability, which could be tracked through mobile applications, can bring huge energy savings to each home.</p>
<p>Self-driving cars could also save energy by optimizing the routes and utilization of the same car by multiple people travelling the same route, regulating speed and energy spend at all times, and thereby saving fuel.</p>
<p>ML could also be used in the smart grid and its maintenance, where it could predict the point of failure and the time at which failure occurred, so the required preventive steps can be taken.</p>

<p>The hardware is the platform that forms the basis for executing ML mobile applications. ML has specific requirements in terms of processing units and memory in order to run the complex ML algorithms. Until recently hardware limitations was one reason that drove the majority of ML processing to be undertaken in backend servers where there are no limits on processing units or memory. But now, most device manufacturers are making groundbreaking innovations that render hardware suitable for running mobile on-device ML applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Apple has already designed and built a neural engine as part of its iPhone X's main chip set </span><span>to handle complex ML-driven image processing.</span></li>
<li>In the Pixel 2 device, Google has also built a custom chip set that caters to ML needs.</li>
<li><span>Huawei's Mate 10 also has a neural network processing unit built into it.</span></li>
<li><span>ARM has launched a project designed to create an AI-driven smart chip that will </span><span>allow mobile devices to continue running ML algorithms even when offline. This will reduce data traffic, speed up processing, and also save battery power consumed.</span></li>
<li>Qualcomm is also working with ARM to produce next generation mobile devices that enable ML algorithms to be run efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we have seen in this book, there are various SDKs available that will help programmers create mobile ML programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>TensorFlow Lite</li>
<li>Caffe2Go</li>
<li>Core ML</li>
<li>ML Kit</li>
<li>Fritz</li>
</ul>
<p>We have gone through the high-level architecture of these SDKs and also written sample mobile ML applications using each of the preceding SDKs in this book. </p>
<p>There are opportunities for all in the following areas of mobile ML technology enablement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like hybrid mobile application development, there can be way for hybrid ML model development that could employ a common language to develop these ML models</li>
<li>There are many issues in terms of model deployment and upgrading of the deployed live ML models in the field</li>
<li>There are many things to improve in terms of monitoring the performance and usage of the ML models in the field</li>
<li>There is a lot of work to be undertaken to support many ML algorithms in these SDKs</li>
<li>Now, predominantly, only prediction and usage of models is being done from mobile; training can also be undertaken from mobile on-device training enablement</li>
</ul>
