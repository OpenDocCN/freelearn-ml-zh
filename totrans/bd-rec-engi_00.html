The book covers various recommendation engines widely used across industries with their implementations. This book also covers a chapter on popular datamining techniques commonly used in building recommendations and also discuss in brief about the future of recommendation engines at the end of the book.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Recommendation Engines" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Recommendation Engines</em></span>, will be a refresher to Data Scientists and an introduction to the beginners of recommendation engines.
