- en: '**Machine learning** (**ML**), part of the wider field of **Artificial Intelligence**
    (**AI**), is rightfully recognized as one of the most powerful tools available
    for organizations to extract value from their data. As the capabilities of ML
    algorithms have grown over the years, it has become increasingly obvious that
    implementing such algorithms in a scalable, fault-tolerant, and automated way
    requires the creation of new disciplines. These disciplines, **ML Engineering**
    (**MLE**) and **ML Operations** (**MLOps**), are the focus of this book.'

- en: The book covers a wide variety of topics in order to help you understand the
    tools, techniques, and processes you can apply to engineer your ML solutions,
    with an emphasis on introducing the key concepts so that you can build on them
    in your future work. The aim is to develop fundamentals and a broad understanding
    that will stand the test of time, rather than just provide a series of introductions
    to the latest tools, although we do cover a lot of the latest tools!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of the code examples are given in Python, the most popular programming language
    in the world (at the time of writing) and the *lingua franca* for data applications.
    Python is a high-level and object-oriented language with a rich ecosystem of tools
    focused on data science and ML. For example, packages such as *scikit-learn* and
    *pandas* have have become part of the standard lexicon for data science teams
    across the world. The central tenet of this book is that knowing how to use packages
    like these is not enough. In this book, we will use these tools, and many, many
    more, but focus on how to wrap them up in production-grade pipelines and deploy
    them using appropriate cloud and open-source tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will cover everything from how to organize your ML team, to software development
    methodologies and best practices, to automating model building through to packaging
    your ML code, how to deploy your ML pipelines to a variety of different targets
    and then on to how to scale your workloads for large batch runs. We will also
    discuss, in an entirely new chapter for this second edition, the exciting world
    of applying ML engineering and MLOps to deep learning and generative AI, including
    how to start building solutions using **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) and
    the new field of **LLM Operations** (**LLMOps**).

- en: The second edition of *Machine Learning Engineering with Python* goes into a
    lot more depth than the first edition in almost every chapter, with updated examples
    and more discussion of core concepts. There is also a far wider selection of tools
    covered and a lot more focus on open-source tools and development. The ethos of
    focusing on core concepts remains, but it is my hope that this wider view means
    that the second edition will be an excellent resource for those looking to gain
    practical knowledge of machine learning engineering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although a far greater emphasis has been placed on using open-source tooling,
    many examples will also leverage services and solutions from Amazon Web Services
    (AWS). I believe that the accompanying explanations and discussions will, however,
    mean that you can still apply everything you learn here to any cloud provider
    or even in an on-premises setting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers
    who want to build robust software solutions with ML components. It is also relevant
    to anyone who manages or wants to understand the production life cycle of these
    systems. The book assumes intermediate-level knowledge of Python and some basic
    exposure to the concepts of machine learning. Some basic knowledge of AWS and
    the use of Unix tools like bash or zsh will also be beneficial.

    is done using the author’s concept of the model factory, a methodology for repeatable
    model creation and validation. This chapter also discusses key theoretical concepts
    important for understanding machine learning models and covers different types
    of drift detection and model retrain triggering criteria.'

    concepts before moving onto more advanced concepts, and then discusses package
    and environment management, testing, logging and error handling and security.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, some previous exposure to Python development is assumed. Many
    introductory concepts are covered for completeness but in general it will be easier
    to get through the examples if you have already written at least some Python programs
    before. The book also assumes some exposure to the main concepts from machine
    learning, such as what a model is, what training and inference refer to and an
    understanding of similar concepts. Several of these are recapped in the text but
    again it will be a smoother ride if you have previously been acquainted with the
    main ideas behind building a machine learning model, even at a rudimentary level.

- en: On the technical side, to get the most out of the examples in the book, you
    will need access to a computer or server where you have privileges to install
    and run Python and other software packages and applications. For many of the examples,
    access to a UNIX type terminal, such as bash or zsh, is assumed. The examples
    in this book were written and tested on both a Linux machine running Ubuntu LTS
    and an M2 Macbook Pro running macOS. If you use a different setup, for example
    Windows, the examples may require some translation in order to work for your system.
    Note that the use of the M2 Macbook Pro means several examples show some additional
    information to get the examples working on Apple Silicon devices. These sections
    can comfortably be skipped if your system does not require this extra setup.

- en: Many of the Cloud based examples leverage **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**)
    and so require an AWS account with billing setup. Most of the examples will use
    the free-tier services available from AWS but this is not always possible. Caution
    is advised in order to avoid large bills. If in doubt, it is recommended you consult
    the AWS documentation for more information. As a concrete example of this, In
    *Chapter 5*, *Deployment Patterns and Tools*, we use the **Managed Workflows with
    Apache Spark** (**MWAA**) service from AWS. There is no free tier option for MWAA
    so as soon as you spin up the example, you will be charged for the environment
    and any instances. Ensure you are happy to do this before proceeding and I recommend
    tearing down your MWAA instances when finished.
