- en: Big data has become a popular buzzword across many industries. An increasing
    number of people have been exposed to the term and are looking at how to leverage
    big data in their own businesses, to improve sales and profitability. However,
    collecting, aggregating, and visualizing data is just one part of the equation.
    Being able to extract useful information from data is another task, and much more
    challenging.

- en: Traditionally, most researchers perform statistical analysis using historical
    samples of data. The main downside of this process is that conclusions drawn from
    statistical analysis are limited. In fact, researchers usually struggle to uncover
    hidden patterns and unknown correlations from target data. Aside from applying
    statistical analysis, machine learning has emerged as an alternative. This process
    yields a more accurate predictive model with the data inserted into a learning
    algorithm. Through machine learning, the analysis of business operations and processes
    is not limited to human-scale thinking. Machine-scale analysis enables businesses
    to discover hidden values in big data.

    In addition to being the most popular language used by data scientists, R is open
    source and is free for use for all users. The R programming language offers a
    variety of learning packages and visualization functions, which enable users to
    analyze data on the fly. Any user can easily perform machine learning with R on
    their dataset without knowing every detail of the mathematical models behind the
    analysis.

    how to perform machine learning with R. Each of the 12 chapters are introduced
    to you by dividing this topic into several simple recipes. Through the step-by-step
    instructions provided in each recipe, the reader can construct a predictive model
    by using a variety of machine learning packages.'

    use simple R commands to explore data. The next topic covers how to perform statistical
    analysis with machine learning analysis and assessing created models, which are
    covered in detail later on in the book. There is also content on learning how
    to integrate R and Hadoop to create a big data analysis platform. The detailed
    illustrations provide all the information required to start applying machine learning
    to individual projects.
