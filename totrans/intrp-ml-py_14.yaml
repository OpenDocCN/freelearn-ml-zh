- en: Over the last thirteen chapters, we have explored the field of **Machine Learning**
    (**ML**) interpretability. As stated in the preface, it’s a broad area of research,
    most of which hasn’t even left the lab and become widely used yet, and this book
    has no intention of covering absolutely all of it. Instead, the objective is to
    present various interpretability tools in sufficient depth to be useful as a starting
    point for beginners and even complement the knowledge of more advanced readers.
    This chapter will summarize what we’ve learned in the context of the ecosystem
    of ML interpretability methods, and then speculate on what’s to come next!

- en: 'As discussed in *Chapter 1*, *Interpretation, Interpretability, and Explainability;
    and Why Does It All Matter?*, there are three main themes when talking about ML
    interpretability: **Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency** (**FAT**), and
    each of these presents a series of concerns (see *Figure 14.1*). I think we can
    all agree these are all desirable properties for a model! Indeed, these concerns
    all present opportunities for the improvement of **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**)
    systems. These improvements start by leveraging model interpretation methods to
    evaluate models, confirm or dispute assumptions, and find problems.'

  zh: 如*第1章*中所述，*解释、可解释性和可解释性；以及为什么这一切都很重要？*，在讨论机器学习可解释性时，有三个主要主题：**公平性、责任和透明度**（FAT），每个主题都提出了一系列关注点（见*图14.1*）。我想我们都可以同意，这些都是模型所期望的特性！确实，这些关注点都为人工智能（AI）系统的改进提供了机会。这些改进首先通过利用模型解释方法来评估模型、确认或反驳假设以及发现问题开始。
- en: 'What your aim is will depend on what stage you are at in the ML workflow. If
    the model is already in production, the objective might be to evaluate it with
    a whole suite of metrics, but if the model is still in early development, the
    aim may be to find deeper problems that a metric won’t discover. Perhaps you are
    also just using black-box models for knowledge discovery as we did in *Chapter
    4* – in other words, leveraging the models to learn from the data with no plan
    to take it to production. If this is the case, you might confirm or dispute the
    assumptions you had about the data, and by extension, the model:'

    by no means every interpretation method available. They represent the most popular

    weren’t discussed are in *italics* and those that were discussed have the relevant
    chapter numbers provided next to them. There’s been a focus on **model-agnostic**
    methods for **black-box supervised learning models**. Still, outside of this realm,
    there are also many other interpretation methods, such as those found in reinforcement
    learning, generative models, or the many statistical methods used strictly for
    linear regression. And even within the supervised learning black-box model realm,
    there are hundreds of application-specific model interpretation methods used for
    applications ranging from chemistry graph CNNs to customer churn classifiers.

    more models are deployed to the cloud, and it will get worse with the **Artificial
    Intelligence of Things** (**AIoT**). Deployment is not traditionally in the ML
    practitioner’s wheelhouse. That is why ML increasingly depends on **Machine Learning
    Operations** (**MLOps**). And the pace of automation means more tools are needed
    to build, test, deploy, and monitor these models. At the same time, there’s a
    need for the standardization of tools, methods, and metrics. Slowly but surely,
    this is happening. Since 2017, we have had the **Open Neural Network Exchange**
    (**ONNX**), an open standard for interoperability. And at the time of writing,
    the **International Organization for Standardization** (**ISO**) has over two
    dozen AI standards being written (and one published), several of which involve
    interpretability. Naturally, some things will get standardized because of common
    use, due to the consolidation of ML model classes, methods, libraries, service
    providers, and practices. Over time, one or a few in each area will emerge. Lastly,
    given ML’s outsized role in algorithmic decision-making, it’s only a matter of
    time before it is regulated. Only some financial markets regulate trading algorithms,
    such as the **Securities and Exchange Commission** (**SEC**) in the United States
    and the **Financial Conduct Authority** (**FCA**) in the UK. Besides that, only
    data privacy and provenance regulations are widely enforced, such as the HIPAA
    in the US and the LGPD in Brazil. The GDPR in the European Union takes this a
    bit further with the “right to an explanation” for algorithmic decisions but the
    intended scope and methodology are still unclear.

- en: In the future, we won’t program an ML pipeline; it will mostly be a drag-and-drop
    capability with a dashboard offering all kinds of metrics. It will evolve to be
    mostly automated. Automation shouldn’t come as a surprise because some existing
    libraries perform automated feature-selection model training. Some interpretability-enhancing
    procedures may be done automatically, but most of them will require human discretion.
    However, interpretation ought to be injected throughout the process, much like
    planes that mostly fly themselves have instruments that alert pilots of issues;
    the value is in informing the ML practitioner of potential problems and improvements
    at every step. Did it find a feature to recommend for monotonic constraints? Did
    it find some imbalances that might need adjusting? Did it find anomalies in the
    data that might need some correction? Show the practitioner what needs to be seen
    to make an informed decision and let them make it.

    covered some aspects of some of its most important areas on two levels: diagnosis
    and treatment. Practitioners can leverage the tools offered by the toolkit anywhere
    in the ML pipeline. However, it’s up to the practitioner to choose when and how
    to apply them.'

    learning toolkit is like flying a plane with very few instruments or none at all.
    Much like flying a plane operates under different weather conditions, machine
    learning models operate under different data conditions, and to be a skilled pilot
    or machine learning engineer, we can’t be overconfident and validate or rule out
    hypotheses with our instruments. And much like aviation took a few decades to
    become the safest mode of transportation, it will take AI a few decades to become
    the safest mode of decision-making. It will take a global village to get us there,
    but it will be an exciting journey! And remember, *the best way to predict the
    future is to create it*.
