    creating state-of-the-art solutions for many complex problems. Some of these solutions,
    which include Vision AI, Translation AI, Natural Language AI, and Speech AI, are
    quite general-purpose and can be readily leveraged to get insights from complex
    and unstructured data. These solutions are provided as a service and thus as customers,
    we don’t have to worry about managing the infrastructure, availability, or scaling
    of these products. Many popular Google products, such as Maps, Photos, Gmail,
    YouTube, and others make use of these products every day to provide AI-driven
    experiences.

  zh: Cloud Translation API
- en: Google Research has developed several **neural machine translation** (**NMT**)
    models over time and keeps improving them whenever there is better training data
    or improved techniques. The Cloud Translation API makes use of these pre-trained
    models or custom ML models to translate text from various source languages into
    target languages. With the Cloud Translation API, we can dynamically translate
    the contents of our websites or applications programmatically by just using API
    calls. By default, these pre-trained models do not use any customer data for training
    purposes. For a business or company that provides services or products globally,
    it is really important to have language translation capabilities to understand
    and engage the audience more effectively. The Cloud Translation API, as a product,
    addresses the problems of identifying a source language and translating it into
    the desired target language through an API call. It supports over 100 languages
    but if it still doesn’t fulfill your requirements, there are ways to train your
    custom models if you have training data with you. Now, let’s look at the AutoML
    Translation service for custom models.

    languages for translation, but if there is a need to support an additional language,
    we have the flexibility to train our custom models given that we have a sufficient
    amount of training data available with us. Training custom models is also helpful
    when there is a need to support domain-specific translations – for example, if
    we are working in a financial domain, we would like the translation solution to
    provide results that are more specific to the financial language.

    to a wide variety of issues, including payment failures, delivery address updates,
    product quality issues, and so on. As most of these queries are typed by customers
    in a text box, there is a need to classify these queries into a fixed set of categories
    so that they can be routed to the correct resolution team. Classifying these queries
    manually becomes quite difficult when the volume of such queries is large. This
    process can be automated using ML by training a classification model that can
    automatically categorize issues into appropriate categories.

    use of such data is only possible if there is a way to accurately transcribe speech
    data into text format. Once our data has been converted into text format, we can
    train several NLP models to get useful business insights from it. Along similar
