<p class="mce-root">This book serves as a complete guide to becoming well-versed in machine learning on IBM Cloud using Python. You will learn how to build complete machine learning solutions, focusing on the role of data representation and feature extraction.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book starts with supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts, including an overview of IBM Cloud and the Watson Machine Learning service. You will learn how to run various techniques, such as k-means clustering, KNN, time series prediction, visual recognition, and text-to-speech in IBM Cloud by means of real-world examples. You will learn how to create a Spark pipeline in Watson Studio. The book will also guide you in terms of deep learning and neural network principles on IBM Cloud with TensorFlow. You will learn how to build chatbots using NLP techniques. Later, you will cover three powerful case studies – the facial expression classification platform, the automated classification of lithofacies, and the multibiometric identity authentication platform – with a view to becoming well-versed in the methodologies.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of the book, you will be well-positioned to build efficient machine learning solutions on IBM Cloud. You will also be well-equipped with real-world examples to draw insights from the data at hand.</p>

It provides a tour of the machine learning paradigm, with a focus on famous approaches and algorithms. This chapter starts by providing a practical background to model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning. Then it covers supervised learning, and discusses machine learning algorithms for regression problems. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to select proper supervised machine learning models for the data at hand.</span></p>
<p><a href="f131f753-1d77-478c-9c0d-1e799330eed8.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Implementing Unsupervised Algorithms</em><span>, is the sequel to the tour of the machine learning paradigm that began in <a href="8e025e72-a0f0-429a-84a8-f3ffe2c023bf.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Feature Extraction – A Bag of Tricks</em>. This chapter covers unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. Moreover, it discusses famous clustering algorithms, before concluding with a discussion of online versus batch learning.</span></p>
<p><a href="630e47b4-11b7-4be9-a881-8be2cb492314.xhtml"/><a href="673af2b7-d2ce-40af-a960-7708cb231e6a.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Machine Learning Workouts on IBM Cloud</em><span>, provides several examples that are carefully designed to uncover the power of Python as a machine learning programming language of choice and the power of the machine learning service on the IBM Watson Studio platform.

This is a crucial step in drilling applications. First, we will begin by introducing the problem and the dataset. Then we will explain the types of post-processing needed for such cases. Finally, the complete solution is built using the machine learning service on the Watson platform.</span></p>
<p><a href="a2440edb-9ab5-4843-b13b-4ad6058a8af3.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Building a Cloud-Based Multibiometric Identity Authentication Platform</em>, guides the reader on how to build a complete cloud-based human identification system using biometric traits. This chapter begins by introducing the problem and the datasets. Then it explains the types of post-processing needed for each biometric. Moreover, you will learn how to extract meaningful features. Learning and recognition will follow. Finally, you will practice multimodal data fusion. </p>
<p><a href="">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Conclusion</em>, concludes the book with an overview of what has been covered. This chapter also sheds some light on some of the practical considerations related to developing machine learning systems on the cloud. Finally, the book concludes with further discussions on different routes the reader might consider to enhance their skills. </p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The file we are using in this project (</span><kbd>combine.csv</kbd><span>) is a comma-delimited text file containing statistics on players who attended the NFL scouting combine.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>df_data_2.createOrReplaceTempView("station")<br/>sqlDF = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM station where VALUE &gt; 200")<br/>sqlDF.show()</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/><strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong><br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "If you click on the blue <span class="packt_screen">Cloud sign-up/log-in</span> link, you can create a free account (using your IBM ID) or log in (once you have set up your paid or free account).</span><span>"</span></p>
