    patterns, predict behaviors, and decompose the time evolution into known and previously
    studied shapes. We are going to discuss some of them, focusing on the ones that
    are easily solved using Excel. The idea, as usual, is that our machines learn
    about the details in the data and can extract useful knowledge about the past
    and the possible future developments.

    that is, understanding whether it is periodic, whether it shows a given tendency
    (increasing or decreasing with time), or whether it is stationary (mean and variance
    of the values don't change over time), among other measures. Visualization plays
    a fundamental role in this analysis, since many of the time series characteristics
    can be deduced using a graphical representation of the data points, even if there
    are numerical methods to calculate them.

    traveled by plane between 1949 and 1961, grouped by month. After loading the file

- en: A possible way to make the variance independent of time is to take the logarithm
    of the time series values. Try this in the air passengers series and check the
    values of the variance.
