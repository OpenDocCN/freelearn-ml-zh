    (Ireland, Spain, and Switzerland) and in a wide variety of places: in offices
    at Maynooth University, the University of Oviedo and CERN; in an apartment in
    Oviedo, a university dorm in Maynooth, and an apartment in Geneva; in a sports
    pavilion; in the waiting rooms of emergency departments of two different hospitals;
    near the beach; near the mountains; on the backseat of a car; on some commuter
    trains; at several different airports; at a hotel in Almería; and, probably, in
    some other locations that we do not remember now.'

    one was Overleaf ([https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)), which
    allowed us to collaborate and work simultaneously even while we were thousands
    of kilometers away from each other.

- en: To help us write formulas, draw circuits, and format code in LaTeX, we used
    quite a lot of useful packages such as quantikz, physics, siunitx, and listings.
    To create the figures, we used TikZ, Graphviz ([https://graphviz.org/](https://graphviz.org/)),
    and the Graphviz Visual Editor ([http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/](http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/)).
    To write the code examples and run them, we used both Anaconda and Google Colab
    (as described in *Appendix* *[*D*](ch027.xhtml#x1-240000D)*, Installing the Tools*).*
