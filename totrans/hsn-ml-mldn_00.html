<p class="mce-root"><strong>Machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) is widely used in many industries, such as science, healthcare, and research and its popularity is only growing. In March 2018, Microsoft introduced ML.NET to help .NET enthusiasts to work with ML. With this book, you'll explore how to build ML.NET applications with the various ML models available using C# code.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book starts by giving you an overview of ML and the types of ML algorithms used, along with covering what ML.NET is and why you need it to build ML apps. You’ll then explore the ML.NET framework, its components, and APIs. The book will serve as a practical guide to helping you build smart apps using the ML.NET library. You’ll gradually become well-versed in how to implement ML algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering with real-world examples and datasets. Each chapter will cover the practical implementation, showing you how to implement ML within .NET applications. You'll also learn how to integrate TensorFlow into ML.NET applications. Later, you'll discover how to store the regression model housing price prediction results in the database and display the real-time predicted results from the database on your web application using ASP.NET Core Blazor and SignalR.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this book, you'll have learned how to confidently perform basic to advanced-level machine learning tasks in ML.NET.</p>

<p><a href="b8d873e1-9234-4f11-ad94-76df5ffbb228.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Machine Learning and ML.NET</em>, talks about what machine learning is and how important machine learning is in our society today. It also introduces ML.NET and talks in more detail about getting started with it after learning about the concepts of machine learning and how they relate. </p>
<p><a href="b8decd34-4bcb-4b1b-80d2-b2bfd0fa31c1.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Setting Up the ML.NET Environment</em>, t<span>alks in more detail about getting started with ML.NET, continuing the overview of machine learning and how ML.NET can assist in both developing and running models in both new and existing applications. You will ensure your development environment is set up and the chapter ends with a simple pre-trained model in a console application to demonstrate that you are ready to proceed with the training.</span></p>
<p><a href="8bcfc000-9adc-4eda-a91a-e09f676eac85.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Regression Model</em>, talks about using a regression and logistic regression model in ML.NET in addition to the math and what problems these models can help to solve. In addition, the chapter provides a step-by-step explanation of how to create and work with both a regression model and a logistic regression model in ML.NET. The end of the chapter details a quick console application using the dataset and both the models in ML.NET. </p>
<p><a href="da0d1d99-ad37-498b-8670-f8cee6ad49bc.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Classification Model</em>, talks about using the classifications trainer models in ML.NET and what problems a classification model can help to solve. For this chapter, we will create two applications to demonstrate the classification trainer support in ML.NET.  The first predicts whether a car is of good value based on the several attributes and comparative prices using the FastTree trainer that ML.NET provides. The second application takes email data (Subject, Body, Sender) with the SDCA trainer in ML.NET to classify the email as an Order, Spam or Friend. Through these applications, you will also learn how to evaluate classification models.</p>
<p><a href="4c32e261-cec6-4113-9734-1e29c7c18f9a.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Clustering Model</em>, talks about using the k-means clustering trainer in ML.NET in addition to what problems a clustering model can help to solve.  In this chapter, we will use the k-means cluster trainer that ML.NET provides in order to create an example application that will classify files as either executables, documents, or scripts.  In addition, you will learn how to evaluate clustering models in ML.NET.</p>
<p><a href="4e2ca910-b4a8-4f00-b8e4-5f2cf7ee5222.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Anomaly Detection Model</em>, talks about using an anomaly detection model in ML.NET in addition to what problems an anomaly detection model can help to solve. For this chapter, we will create two example applications. The first uses ML.NET with SSA to detect Network Traffic anomalies, while the second example uses ML.NET with PCA to detect anomalies in a series of user logins. With these applications, we will also look at how you can evaluate your anomaly detection model once trained.</p>
<p><a href="71e11a52-eb52-4e43-ae92-3461dfa6ff51.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Matrix Factorization Model</em>, talks about using a matrix factorization model in ML.NET in addition to the math and what problems a matrix factorization model can help to solve.  In this chapter, we will create a music recommendation application using the matrix factorization trainer that ML.NET provides. Using several data points this recommendation engine will recommend music based on the training data provided to the model. In addition, after creating this application we will learn how to evaluate a matrix factorization model in ML.NET.</p>
<p><a href="a29eb79a-eca6-4b4f-b6a1-ee4c57d6d4d4.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Using ML.NET with .NET Core and Forecasting</em>, covers a real-world application utilizing .NET Core and utilizes both a regression and time series model to demonstrate forecasting on stock shares.</p>
<p><a href="5f67e3b8-56bd-47ab-8a72-4f00b239d517.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Using ML.NET with ASP.NET Core</em>, covers a real-world application utilizing ASP.NET with a frontend to upload a file to determine whether it is malicious or not. This chapter focuses on using a binary classifier and how to integrate it into an ASP.NET application. </p>

The application will utilize ML.NET to classify whether the web page content is malicious. The chapter will also cover UWP application design and MVVM briefly to give a true production-ready sample app to build on or adapt to other applications for using UWP with ML.NET.</p>
<p><a href="116bbc2d-9659-4d34-9b2b-26593e29f54a.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Training and Building Production Models</em>, covers training a model at scale with all of the considerations, along with the proper training of a production model using the DMTP project. The lessons learned include obtaining proper training sets (diversity being key), proper features, and the true evaluation of your model. The focus of this chapter is on tips, tricks, and best practices for training production-ready models.</p>
<p><a href="049e90c4-05b0-466d-af93-d56df861a843.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Using TensorFlow with ML.NET</em>, talks about using a pre-trained TensorFlow model with ML.NET to determine whether a car is in a picture or not with a UWP application.</p>
<p><a href="788ee637-ad9b-4ddf-8018-b804d3004404.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Using ONNX with ML.NET</em>, talks about using a pre-trained ONNX model with ML.NET in addition to the value added by taking a pre-existing ONNX format model into ML.NET directly.</p>
