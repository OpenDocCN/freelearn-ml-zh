			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Chapter 12</em>: Conclusion and Best Practices</h1>
			<p>Throughout the chapters of this book, you have been introduced to the field of machine learning on streaming data, using mainly online models. In this last chapter, it is time for a recapitulative overview of all that has been seen throughout the eleven earlier chapters of the book.</p>
			<p>This chapter will cover the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Best practices to keep in mind</li>
				<li>Next steps for your learning journey</li>
				<li>Best practices</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Practice is always different from theory. You <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>have seen a lot of theoretical knowledge throughout this book. In this final section, you will see a number of best practices that always need to be kept in mind while applying the theory in real-life use cases:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clean data/data quality</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Data quality and problems with data understanding are daily problems in most companies. The famous saying goes: "Garbage in, garbage out," implying that when you do machine learning on garbage data, your outputs will also be useless. Thorough data exploration needs to be done on any new business case that comes to you, allowing you to identify potential problems. Data quality processes are often needed but not yet in place. Although out of scope for the data scientist, you can advise on the need and added value of such processes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2"><strong class="bold">Business needs before tech needs</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many data scientists have a mathematics, statistics, or programming background and often have an operational mindset. Something that regularly goes wrong in business cases is that technical people start doing what is technically the best and start sidetracking the lines defined by business projects. Although this is very understandable, it is important to always keep in mind why companies are investing in a specific technology, which is, 99% of the time, to make a return on investing. When working in tech, it is important to keep in mind whether your technical topics are helping the company to reach its objectives, as you may lose funding quickly in the opposite case.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3"><strong class="bold">Business metrics are key to a project succeeding </strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Helping a company reach its goals is often not even enough. You must also be able to prove to your company's leaders that you are indeed making them money or reaching their goals. To prove this, metrics are your best friend. As long as you define<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> your project's key performance indicators from the outset and throughout, you can assure continuing support for your project, allowing you to work on cutting-edge technology.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4"><strong class="bold">Be compatible and make company guidelines your own guidelines</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Long-term successful projects will at some point be evaluated in terms of your company's best practices. If you want to ensure you have long-term relevance to your company, you need to make sure to keep in mind what your company is doing on a general level and make sure that what you do is compatible with this. Allowing incompatibility with the overall architecture is to set yourself up for failure.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><strong class="bold">Technical metrics are great for avoiding problems</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>When projects become large, it may become difficult to maintain a full overview of everything that is running in your production environment. In the same way, as business metrics are used, you can set up technical metrics that help you keep a quick and easy overview of all the things you have and how they are doing. The larger your projects become, the more important monitoring will be, but the harder it will be to implement. The best practice is therefore to implement monitoring as soon as possible.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6"><strong class="bold">Don't reinvent the wheel</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many data scientists and machine learning engineers are technology enthusiasts with our own ideas and vision on how to implement certain functionalities. One thing to keep in mind, though, is to avoid reinventing the wheel. When solutions already exist, be it in the company or outside, it is often useful to investigate whether it is possible to<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> reuse them instead of "re-inventing the wheel" by developing the exact same functionality again.</p>
			<p>The next section will guide you in furthering your knowledge and skills in the field of streaming analytics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Going further</h1>
			<p>The focus of this book has been on giving you the tools necessary to get a quick introduction to the field of streaming analytics and has relatively quickly moved on to online machine learning algorithms for data science.</p>
			<p>If you want to go further in streaming analytics, there are generally two directions in which you could start your journey: depth-first or breadth-first.</p>
			<p>The depth-first approach consists of going even more in depth into online machine learning than the current book has been able to do. Although you should now have a solid basis in online machine learning, there is always more to learn. A number of useful resources for this follow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keeping up with the general field of machine learning on the scientific side:<ul><li><a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">https://paperswithcode.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent">https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent</a></li></ul></li>
				<li>Keeping up with a lot of practitioners that love sharing what they do:<ul><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/">https://towardsdatascience.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://neptune.ai/blog">https://neptune.ai/blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">https://www.kdnuggets.com/</a></li></ul></li>
				<li>Follow influential data scientists and machine learning practitioners on social networks such as the following:<ul><li>LinkedIn</li><li>Twitter</li></ul></li>
				<li>Practice your skills with tools such as the following:<ul><li>Kaggle and other machine learning competitions</li><li>Hackathons</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The breadth-first approach would suggest that you focus on auxiliary domains first, to have an all-around mastery of the architecture topics, data engineering, code efficiency, and the like. The following resources may be helpful for a journey in this direction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Look into cloud architecture and obtain certifications for the most popular ones:<ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification">https://cloud.google.com/certification</a></li></ul></li>
				<li>Improve your coding skills:<ul><li>Codewars, HackerRank, and other competitive coding tools</li><li>Open source contributions</li></ul></li>
				<li>Learn new tools and environments:<ul><li>Learn machine learning in PySpark.</li><li>Learn machine learning in R.</li><li>Learn machine learning in Julia.</li><li>Databricks.</li><li>Dataiku.</li><li>AWS SageMaker.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The focus is quite different between the two directions. At the end of your journey, you may want to consider your insight into both directions. The direction that is most relevant for you will always depend on your personal objectives.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, you have seen a list of best practices that will help you to be successful and efficient while implementing this theory in practice. Finally, you have seen two potential learning paths that you may want to follow when continuing your learning journey into streaming analytics and online models. </p>
			<p>With this, we have come to the end of this book. I hope that the book has been useful to you and that you will be successful in applying the topics in practice. It was a pleasure writing about this topic, which I am sure is going to gain a lot of traction soon. It will be one of the topics to look out for in the next trends of data science and machine learning. Of course, feel free to follow the publisher and me online for many new materials on streaming, data science, and more related topics to be published soon.</p>
