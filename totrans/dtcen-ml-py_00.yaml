- en: If you’re reading this, you’ve taken the first steps on a pioneering journey
    to building and implementing machine learning models that are more robust, accurate,
    fairer, less biased, and easier to explain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a big claim, we know. We are comfortable making it, however, on the
    basis of the huge and relatively untapped potential we see in the data-centric
    approach to machine learning development.

- en: Why do we consider data-centric machine learning pioneering?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may seem obvious that improving data quality will lead to more predictive
    models. However, machine learning research to date has mainly focused on evolving
    the various algorithms and tools to build and tune models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result, we have available at our fingertips a vast array of machine learning
    algorithms, tools, and techniques that can give us great models at a low cost,
    given the right quality and volume of input data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model architectures are largely a solved problem in most situations. What data
    scientists, and the organizations they work in, typically lack are best-practice
    frameworks, tools, and techniques for improving data quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data-centric machine learning builds on the predominant model-centric approach
    to model development by exploiting the big opportunities that lie in better input
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Putting a bigger emphasis on data collection and engineering requires us to
    streamline our processes for collecting quality data and invent new techniques
    for engineering datasets that provide more signals with much less data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the techniques and examples you will learn about in this book are based
    on cutting-edge research and the application of modern practices to collecting,
    engineering, and synthetically generating great datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data-centric machine learning also necessitates a much stronger collaboration
    between data scientists, subject-matter experts, and data labelers. As you will
    learn throughout this book, data-centricity typically starts with humans collecting
    and labeling data in a way that serves operational and data science needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many organizations, it is uncommon to collect data for machine learning purposes
    specifically. A more systematic approach to collecting and labeling data for data
    science will not only lead to better data but also bring together the thinking
    and creativity of subject-matter experts and data scientists. This positive feedback
    loop between different kinds of domain experts creates new opportunities for ideas
    to flourish far beyond the scope of individual machine learning projects.

    counterparts in almost every aspect?

    computer, the car you drive, the chair you sit on, or something else that has
    required some level of design and engineering.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Design and functionality have a lot to do with it, but unless the product is
    made of quality materials, it will not work as intended or it may break altogether.
    Something is only high-quality if it works as intended, and does so consistently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    quality – our building materials – we are able to build models that are more predictive,
    robust, and interpretable.

    knowledge, tools, techniques, and applied examples needed to implement data-centric
    machine learning and take part in the next phase of the AI revolution.
