    who are looking for guidance and hands-on learning materials to become ML solutions
    architects, and experienced ML architecture practitioners and data scientists
    who are looking to develop a broader understanding of industry ML use cases, enterprise
    data and ML architecture patterns, data management and ML tools, ML governance,
    and advanced ML engineering techniques. This book can also benefit data engineers
    and cloud system administrators looking to understand how data management and
    cloud system architecture fit into the overall ML platform architecture. Risk
    professionals, AI product managers, and technology decision makers will also benefit
    from topics on AI risk management, business AI use cases, and ML maturity journey
    and best practices.'
