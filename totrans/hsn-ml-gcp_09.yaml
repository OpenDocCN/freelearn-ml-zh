- en: Neural network is a supervised learning algorithm that is loosely inspired by
    the way the brain functions. Similarly to the way neurons are connected to each
    other in the brain, a neural network takes an input and passes it through a function,
    based on which certain subsequent neurons get excited, and the output is produced.

- en: In this chapter, we learned to set up Datalab to execute neural networks on
    Google Cloud. We also learned the structure of a neural network and how various
    parameters, such as depth, number of hidden units, activation function, optimizer,
    batch size, and number of epochs, impact the accuracy of the model. We also saw
    how to implement a neural network in both Keras and TensorFlow. Topics such as
    using premade estimators and creating custom estimators in TensorFlow were covered.
