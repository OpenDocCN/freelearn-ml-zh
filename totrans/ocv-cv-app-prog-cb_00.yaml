- en: OpenCV (Open source Computer Vision) is an open source library that contains
    more than 500 optimized algorithms for image and video analysis. Since its introduction
    in 1999, it has been largely adopted as the primary development tool by the community
    of researchers and developers in computer vision. OpenCV was originally developed
    at Intel by a team led by Gary Bradski as an initiative to advance research in
    vision and promote the development of rich vision-based, CPU-intensive applications.
    After a series of beta releases, Version 1.0 was launched in 2006\. A second major
    release occurred in 2009 with the launch of OpenCV 2 that proposed important changes,
    especially the new C++ interface that we use in this book. In 2012, OpenCV reshaped
    itself as a nonprofit foundation ([http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/)) that
    relies on crowdfunding for its future development.

- en: This book is a new edition of *OpenCV Computer Vision Application Programming
    Cookbook*. All the programming recipes of the previous editions have been reviewed
    and updated. We also have added new content to provide readers with even better
    coverage of the essential functionalities of the library. This book covers many
    of the library's features and shows you how to use them to accomplish specific
    tasks. Our objective is not to provide detailed coverage of every option offered
    by the OpenCV functions and classes, but rather to give you the elements you need
    to build your applications from the ground up. In this book, we also explore fundamental
    concepts in image analysis, and we describe some of the important algorithms in
    computer vision.

    and video analysis. However, this is just the beginning. The good news is that
    OpenCV continues to evolve and expand. Just consult the OpenCV online documentation
    at [http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/) to stay updated on what the library
    can do for you. You can also visit the author's website at [www.laganiere.name](http://www.laganiere.name)

- en: This Cookbook is based on the C++ API of the OpenCV library. Therefore, it is
    assumed that you have some experience with the C++ language. In order to run the
    examples presented in the recipes and experiment with them, you need a good C++
    development environment. Microsoft Visual Studio and Qt are two popular choices.
