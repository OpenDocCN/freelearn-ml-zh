    Learning Workouts on IBM Cloud*, **k-means clustering** is an unsupervised machine
    learning methodology—an algorithm that is commonly used to find groups within
    **unlabeled** data. Again, since the goal here is to demonstrate how you can apply
    this methodology to some data using Python in Watson Studio, we won't bother to
    dissect the details of how k-means works, but will show a working example of the
    algorithm, using Watson Studio as a proof of concept.

    has frequent shifts in value. You see time series analysis generally used for
    non-stationary data, such as evaluating and predicting retail sales. In this example,

    chapter), we used Insert to Code and then Insert pandas DataFrame so that Watson
    Studio would generate the code required to import the required Python modules,
    load the data (into a Python DataFrame object, named `df_data_1`) and print the

    the forecast to start at 2017-07-01 (to the end of the data). Again, a plot is

    forecast predictions. Overall, the sales forecast seems to align with the actual
    sales values and shows an upward trend that starts from the beginning of the year.
