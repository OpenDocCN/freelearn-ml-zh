<p class="mce-root"><span class="sugar_field">In our daily work, which is predominantly information technology, the necessity of machine learning is everywhere and is demanded by all developers, programmers, and analysts. But why use C# for machine learning? The answer is, most production enterprise applications are written in C# using tools </span><span>such</span><span> </span><span>as Visual Studio, SQL Server, Unity, and Microsoft Azure.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span class="sugar_field">This book provides an intuitive understanding of various concepts, the techniques of machine learning, and various machine learning tools through which users can add intelligent features such as image and motion detection, Bayes intuition, deep learning and belief, and more to C# .NET applications.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span class="sugar_field">Using this book, you will implement supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and will be well equipped to create good predictive models. You will learn numerous techniques and algorithms, right from simple linear regression, decision trees, and SVM to advanced concepts such as artificial neural networks, autoencoders, and reinforcement learning.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span class="sugar_field">By the end of this book, you will have developed a machine learning mindset and will be able to leverage C# tools, techniques, and packages to build smart, predictive, and real-world business applications.</span></p>

We will show the reader how to benchmark code and functions. We will also explain what an activation function is and show how we have microbenchmarked many of the activation functions in use today. The reader will gain valuable insights into the time each function takes, as well as the timing difference between using floats and doubles.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><a href="4284252c-ddac-4d3c-967f-32e347cbd00b.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em><span>Intuitive Deep Learning in C# .NET</span></em><span>, covers an open source framework named Kelp.Net. This framework is the most powerful deep learning framework available for C# .NET developers. We will show the reader how to perform many operations and tests using the framework, and integrate this with ReflectInsight to get incredible, rich information about our deep learning algorithms.</span></p>
<p><a href="ea816b78-4ae2-4c51-b7cf-143cfd6c2edd.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em><span>Quantum Computing – The Future</span></em><span>, expose the reader to the future, the world of quantum computing.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>We will use the</span><span> </span><kbd>AddLine</kbd><span> function of the truth table to add this information</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">// build the truth tables<br/>UberDriver?.Table?.AddLine(0.85, true);<br/>WitnessSawUberDriver?.Table?.AddLine(0.80, true, true);<br/>WitnessSawUberDriver?.Table?.AddLine(0.20, true, false);<br/>network.Validate();</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>config.Add(new CsvExporter(CsvSeparator.<strong>CurrentCulture</strong>,<br/>  new BenchmarkDotNet.Reports.SummaryStyle<br/>{<br/>  PrintUnitsInHeader = true,<br/>  PrintUnitsInContent = false,<br/>  TimeUnit = TimeUnit.Microsecond,<br/>  SizeUnit = BenchmarkDotNet.Columns.SizeUnit.KB<br/>}));</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "The <span class="packt_screen">Message</span> <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> panel displays the extended details of the selected message.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
