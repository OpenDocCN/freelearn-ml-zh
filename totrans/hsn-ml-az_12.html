<p>In this chapter, we will learn about the new capabilities that were launched with the Azure Machine Learning service that can help data scientists and AI developers with <strong>end-to-end</strong> (<strong>E2E</strong>) machine learning.</p>
<p>When developing AI applications, we can use cognitive services, as described in <a href="89299379-0f5e-4602-ad78-9d3d46a0710e.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Cognitive Services</em>. Alternatively, we can create custom machine learning models with our own data, because cognitive services won't work in every possible scenario. In cases such as these, we have to train our own machine learning algorithms. The Azure Machine Learning service has an SDK, CLI, and APIs that can help you to create these custom models.</p>

<p>As shown in the following diagram, the first step in E2E machine learning is <strong>data preparation</strong>, which includes cleaning the data and featurization. Then, we have to create and train a machine learning model in the  <strong>m</strong><strong>odel training </strong>step. After that, we have <strong>m</strong><strong>odel deployment</strong>, which means deploying the model as a web service to perform predictions. The final step is <strong>m</strong><strong>onitoring</strong>, which includes analyzing how the model is performing and then triggering the retraining of the model.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-873 image-border" src="Images/9fe50b26-c95f-4730-aac1-617edb56ca73.png" style="width:36.42em;height:4.92em;" width="1661" height="224"/></p>
<p>The Azure ML SDK enables professional data scientists and DevOps engineers to carry out E2E machine learning. It allows us to seamlessly use the power of the cloud to train and deploy our model. We can start using the Azure ML SDK easily by installing it using <kbd>pip</kbd> in any Python environment. We can scale the compute for training by using a cluster of CPUs or GPUs. We can also easily track the run history of all experiments with the SDK. This run history is stored in a shareable workspace, which allows teams to share the resources and experiment results. Another advantage of the SDK is that it allows us to find the best model from multiple runs of our experiment, based on a metric that we specify, such as, for example, the highest accuracy rate or the lowest rate of errors.</p>
<p>Once we have a machine learning model that meets our needs, we can put it into operation using the Azure ML service. We can create a web service from the model that can be deployed in the Azure-managed computer or IoT device. The SDK can be installed in any IDE, so you can even deploy the model using VS Code or PyCharm if you do not use Jupyter Notebooks or Databricks. For development testing scenarios, we can deploy the web service to the <span><strong>Azure Container Instance</strong> (</span><strong>ACI)</strong>. To<span> deploy the model in production, we can use</span> <span><strong>Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> (</span><strong>AKS)</strong><span>. After the web service is deployed to AKS, we can enable monitoring and see how the web service is performing.</span></p>
<p>The following sample code shows how to use the SDK for E2E machine learning. Start by creating a workspace for your machine learning project. This will be created in your Azure subscription and can be shared with different users in your organization. This workspace logically groups the computes, experiments, datastores, models, images, and deployments that we will need for E2E machine learning:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-874 image-border" src="Images/b57e9787-ddf2-4673-9b30-53c819842c43.png" style="width:28.83em;height:8.50em;" width="847" height="252"/></p>
<p>This workspace can be accessed either via code or in the Azure portal within our subscription. We can manage all logical components of the workspace and we can also manage user permissions. The following screenshot shows the components of a workspace as seen in the portal:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875 image-border" src="Images/f628e88a-5de1-4185-a024-5e7256a2ec9f.png" style="width:17.75em;height:43.00em;" width="450" height="1090"/></p>
<p>Once we have created a workspace, we can create a training compute that can scale automatically based on our training requirements. This compute can use either CPU or GPU, and we can use whichever framework we like. We can perform classical machine learning with scikit-learn, for example, or deep learning with <span>TensorFlow</span><span>. Any framework or library can be installed using <kbd>pip</kbd> and used with the SDK. We can submit experiment runs to this compute and we will see the results both in our environment and in the Azure portal. We can also log metrics as part of our training script. Here are some sample screenshots of how experiments run, and</span> <span>how corresponding metrics may appear in the Azure portal.</span> <span>We can also access these metrics using code with the SDK.</span></p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the number of experiments and the duration it took to run each experiment: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876 image-border" src="Images/5b1c89f9-6643-4ca6-b1c6-ea70f39d213e.png" style="width:40.42em;height:21.33em;" width="1135" height="601"/></p>
<p>This screenshot shows the metrics that are being monitored within a particular run:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/533e4f22-57a0-4a85-b136-31eae588077c.jpg" style="width:40.00em;height:25.17em;" width="1231" height="775"/></p>
<p>As mentioned, we can find the best run based on a particular metric of interest. An example of a code snippet used to find the best run is as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/bef39db5-adb8-42b5-aa26-51bf84a3265d.jpg" style="width:41.67em;height:4.00em;" width="1328" height="127"/></p>
<p>Once we have found the best run, we can deploy the model as a web service, either to ACI or AKS. To do this, we need to provide a scoring script and an environment configuration, in addition to the model that we want to deploy. Here is an example of code that can be used to deploy models:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4231a365-173d-4dcf-9d54-381308fe24b8.png" style="width:40.08em;height:15.17em;" width="1244" height="473"/></p>
<p>When a model is deployed in production to AKS and monitoring is enabled, we can view insights on how our web service is performing. We can also add custom monitoring for our model. The following screenshot shows how the web service has performed over a few days:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878 image-border" src="Images/5fe13434-0bf9-41c6-baea-8b9db00c35b3.png" style="width:164.58em;height:44.00em;" width="1975" height="528"/></p>
