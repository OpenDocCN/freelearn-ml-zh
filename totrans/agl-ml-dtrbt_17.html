			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Chapter 14</em>: Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In the preceding chapters, we learned to build and deploy models with DataRobot. We learned the basics, along with some advanced data science concepts. The disciplines of ML and data science continue to evolve rapidly. In response, tools such as DataRobot are also enhancing their capabilities. While these tools will continue to advance and make data scientists more productive, it is also expected that the role of good data scientists will become increasingly important and better understood. I hope we have convinced you that data scientists are not about to become obsolete and also that these tools have a lot to offer for data scientists, regardless of their level of expertise. It is also true that the methods and tools that we have right now are still very limited when it comes to intelligence. There is a lot of learning and uncovering to be done before the systems we build can be called intelligent.</p>
			<p>The information we have provided so far should help you get started in developing and deploying models and start impacting your business. There is still a lot more to learn in this journey. In this chapter, we will provide sources for finding additional information regarding DataRobot and also discuss what the future of data science and DataRobot might look like. We're going to cover the following main topics:</p>

Let's now discuss where ML seems to be headed.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Future of automated machine learning</h1>
			<p>It has been over 5 years since automated ML tools started appearing in the data science community. There are now several open source tools (for example, TPOT and Auto-WEKA) as well as <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>proprietary tools (for example, Kortical and H2O) on the market. All major cloud providers now have some AutoML offering. Interest in these tools has been rising. It is safe to say that interest in these tools will keep rising and more offerings should be expected to come onto the market. We expect the tools to keep expanding the scope of tasks that will be automated to cover more aspects of the model development process. We can already see tools such as DataRobot offering more functions through internal development as well as through acquisitions such as Paxata. While it remains true that these tools do not support all use cases or types of modeling, they do cover a large number of use cases in a typical organization. More capabilities and algorithms are being added every quarter. We also expect that some niche vendors will emerge that focus on specific problems or methods such as reinforcement learning.</p>
			<p>Many of the ideas and methods described in this book can be used with other AutoML tools or even with just a notebook environment with open source Python libraries. The AutoML tools essentially serve to automate many of the mundane and labor-intensive tasks. Even with these developments, we expect that not all aspects of the model development process can be automated. We covered many of these aspects in different chapters of this book. Hence, it is our belief that trained and experienced data scientists will always be needed. Adoption of these tools will enable the data scientists to cover more use cases and the resulting models will be of higher quality. These tools will also expand the reach of advanced algorithms to analysts in organizations who understand data science concepts but are not as familiar or comfortable with programming. Like any tool or technology, there is the possibility of misuse. Data-savvy organizations will put model governance and training programs in place to prevent problems relating to the use of bad or biased data, solving the wrong problem, or creating solutions that are not actionable. Also, the organizations should look into their specific needs and then select the tools most appropriate for their situation.</p>
			<p>It is also expected that ML will need to move beyond pattern matching and we expect a bigger focus on causal modeling in the coming years. This is because many industrial use cases require specific <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>decisions to be made or interventions that require decision makers to understand causal impacts and the consequences of these decisions. We have discussed some of these topics and methods. These methods defy automation in their current form and require substantial human input. For these methods to become mainstream, aspects of these methods need to be automated to enable organizations to start adopting them.</p>
			<p>As the tools expand to include causal modeling, it will become imperative that capabilities be added to build models at a systemic level or be able to compose models to create a broader view of the systems under consideration. We will see the emergence of "digital twin" models that will represent entire systems. It will also be necessary to manage and control the configuration of many experiments that will need to be conducted. Given that large datasets are involved in building single models, current methods for running multiple experiments on multiple models are not scalable.</p>
			<p>We also expect more data scientists to adopt the AutoML tools as they start realizing that these tools will make them more productive, while still giving them all the flexibility they need. This is done by combining programming languages, APIs, and automation support.</p>
			<p>Another trend to watch is tool vendors' focus on solving customers' problems. It is very common for some vendors to lose customer focus as they grow bigger, which ultimately can lead to their downfall. This is not a new phenomenon; it has been happening to tool vendors for a long time. We have seen many vendors lose this focus and fade into oblivion. Some of this will also happen to AutoML vendors, so be on the lookout for vendors who are not very responsive to your needs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Future of DataRobot</h1>
			<p>DataRobot was the early pioneer in the AutoML space and seems to be the dominant player, but there are <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>many others (H20, Kortical, and Google Cloud AutoML, to name a few) that are catching up rapidly. Many of the large cloud players are jumping into this space and have offerings that are very attractively priced. DataRobot continues to offer additional capabilities combined with good support from experienced data scientists. To that end, we expect that the DataRobot API will continue to evolve and become more robust to allow experienced data scientists to use DataRobot in a highly flexible and automated way.</p>
			<p>We have noticed new capabilities being released even as this book is being written, such as the recent acquisition of the Zepl notebook platform. In addition to that, DataRobot continues to acquire <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>other companies to round out its offerings. Recently, a lot of focus has been on MLOps and enabling the rapid deployment of models. As the features and capabilities increase, the learning curve for understanding and using DataRobot also increases. It is our experience that many data scientists who use DataRobot are not fully aware of its capabilities and are not utilizing it to its fullest extent. We hope that books such as this will help with this issue. This alone, however, will not be enough to maintain a competitive position. Expanding into next-generation capabilities outlined in the previous section will be necessary to maintain an edge.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, we hope that we have given you a good overview of how you can put DataRobot to practical use in your organization right away and make your data science journey more productive. Hopefully, we have convinced you that a data scientist's role is not just to produce predictions, but to help enable good decisions. Just as a lot of what we do automates the tasks of many roles in the organization, it is also imperative that we do not fear the automation of data science tasks. We hope that this book provides useful ideas to a broad range of data scientists across a broad range of industries.</p>
