<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Advanced Data Visualization Techniques for Machine Learning Solutions</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving world of data analytics and machine learning, the ability to effectively visualize complex information has become crucial. As organizations strive to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of data, they need powerful tools that can transform raw numbers into meaningful <span class="No-Break">visual representations.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we delve into the realm of advanced data visualization techniques within the context of machine learning solutions. We explore how Qlik’s sophisticated visual analytics capabilities can enhance the understanding and interpretation of machine learning models and <span class="No-Break">their outputs.</span></p>
<p>This chapter will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively leverage Qlik’s visual analytics capabilities to gain deeper insights, make informed decisions, and drive actionable outcomes in the era of machine learning and <span class="No-Break">big data.</span></p>
<p>The main topics covered in this chapter are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Visualizing machine <span class="No-Break">learning data</span></li>
<li>Chart and visualization types <span class="No-Break">in Qlik</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Visualizing machine learning data</h1>
<p>When visualizing <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>machine learning data, several important aspects should be considered to ensure effective communication and interpretation of the insights. The following should be considered (these are <span class="No-Break">not tool-specific):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Understand the data</strong>: Gain a deep<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> understanding of the data you are working with. Analyze its structure, distributions, and relationships to identify key variables and patterns. This understanding will guide you in selecting appropriate <span class="No-Break">visualization techniques.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Choose the right visualization techniques</strong>: Select visualization techniques that best represent the characteristics and relationships within the data. Common techniques include scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and network graphs. Choose techniques that effectively convey the information you want to communicate. In the next chapter, we will discover the different visualizations that <span class="No-Break">Qlik offers.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Simplify and reduce complexity</strong>: Keep the visualizations as simple and clear as possible. Avoid clutter and excessive detail, which can confuse the audience. Highlight the most important insights and use visual cues such as colors and annotations to guide the <span class="No-Break">viewer’s attention.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Use appropriate visual encodings</strong>: Leverage visual encodings to represent different attributes of the data effectively. Utilize position, length, angle, color, size, and shape to <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>encode variables and convey meaningful information. Make sure the chosen encodings accurately represent the <span class="No-Break">data attributes.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Consider scaling and normalization</strong>: If the data has a wide range of values or varying scales, consider scaling or normalizing the data to ensure accurate visualization. Scaling techniques such as standardization or min-max scaling can help bring data within a comparable range for <span class="No-Break">proper visualization.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Utilize interactive visualizations</strong>: Incorporate interactivity into your visualizations to enable users to explore the data dynamically. Allow for zooming, panning, filtering, and selecting data points of interest. Interactive visualizations enhance user engagement and understanding of the data. With Qlik tools, interaction is built in, so there is no need for <span class="No-Break">extra steps.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Provide context and interpretation</strong>: Include clear labels, titles, and axis descriptions to provide context and guide interpretation. Explain the meaning of the visualized data and provide relevant background information. Add captions, legends, or tooltips to help viewers understand the <span class="No-Break">visual elements.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Consider multiple views or multiple visualizations</strong>: Sometimes, presenting the data through multiple views or multiple visualizations can provide a more comprehensive understanding. Combine different techniques, such as overlaying multiple plots or using small multiples, to reveal different aspects of the data. In Qlik Sense, consider the structure of the application and how to utilize sheets to divide the data into <span class="No-Break">informative views.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Test and iterate</strong>: Test the visualizations with different users or stakeholders to gather feedback and improve their effectiveness. Iterate on the design based on user feedback and refine the visualizations to ensure they are clear, insightful, and meet the <span class="No-Break">intended goals.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Tailor visualizations to the audience</strong>: Consider the knowledge and expertise of your audience when designing visualizations. Adapt the level of detail, technicality, and <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>complexity of the visualizations to the audience’s understanding. Provide explanations and context <span class="No-Break">as necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>One important aspect of any data visualization is the effective use of color. When designing a color scheme for the data visualization, the following aspects should <span class="No-Break">be considered:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Choose a purposeful color palette</strong>: Select a color palette that aligns with the purpose and context of the visualization. Consider using qualitative color schemes (distinct colors for different categories), sequential color schemes (gradation of colors for ordered data), or diverging color schemes (highlighting extremes or differences). You can use tools such as color pickers or online color palette generators to find harmonious and visually pleasing <span class="No-Break">color combinations.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Differentiate categories</strong>: When representing different categories or groups, use distinct colors to ensure clear differentiation. Avoid using similar hues that may cause confusion or make it difficult to distinguish between categories. Ensure that the chosen colors are visually distinguishable, even for individuals with color <span class="No-Break">vision deficiencies.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Use color consistently</strong>: Maintain consistency in the use of colors across the visualization. Assign the same color to the same category or variable throughout the visualization to provide visual continuity and aid interpretation. Consistency helps users establish mental associations between colors and the corresponding <span class="No-Break">data elements.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Highlight key elements</strong>: Utilize color to draw attention to important elements or highlight specific data points of interest. Use a contrasting or vibrant color for emphasis. For instance, you can highlight outliers, maximum and minimum values, or data points that meet specific criteria to make them visually <span class="No-Break">stand out.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Consider color symbolism</strong>: Be mindful of any inherent symbolism associated with colors in different cultures or contexts. Colors may have different connotations or meanings in different contexts. Consider cultural sensitivities and ensure that color choices do not unintentionally convey misleading or<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> <span class="No-Break">inappropriate messages.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Maintain accessibility</strong>: Ensure that the chosen colors are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with color vision deficiencies. Avoid relying solely on color to convey information. Use alternative visual cues, such as patterns, labels, or textures, to supplement or replace color distinctions. Tools such as ColorBrewer and accessible color palette generators can help create color palettes that meet <span class="No-Break">accessibility guidelines.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Balance the visual hierarchy</strong>: Use colors to establish a visual hierarchy within the visualization. Employ different shades or intensities of a color to indicate varying levels of importance or significance. Lighter colors can be used for background or less important elements, while darker or bolder colors can be used for key elements or primary <span class="No-Break">focus areas.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Limit the number of colors</strong>: Avoid using too many colors in a single visualization, as it can lead to visual clutter and confusion. Limit the color palette to a manageable number of distinct colors based on the number of categories or variables being represented. Consider using additional visual encoding techniques such as size, shape, or texture to supplement color differentiations <span class="No-Break">if</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker568"/></span><span class="No-Break"> necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Color themes and gradients for the Qlik application can be defined using themes or put them directly into the application. If there is a common color theme that should be used across multiple applications, a custom theme <span class="No-Break">is recommended.</span></p>
<p>Now that we have learned some basic principles about data visualizations and colors, in the next section, we will take a closer look at some of the charts that Qlik <span class="No-Break">Sense provides.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Chart and visualization types in Qlik</h1>
<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> will take a closer look at different visualization types in Qlik. We will also discover the general settings for layouts. As of writing this chapter, the following visualization types are supported (bolded ones are covered in more detail in <span class="No-Break">this chapter):</span></p>
<p><span class="No-Break">Charts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Bar charts</strong></span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Box plots</strong></span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Bullet charts</strong></span></li>

<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Waterfall charts</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="No-Break">Text-based</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker570"/></span><span class="No-Break"> visualizations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break">Filter panes</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">KPIs</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Pivot tables</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Tables</span></li>
<li>Text &amp; <span class="No-Break">image</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="No-Break">Dashboard objects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break">Buttons</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Containers</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">In this chapter, we cover only the native visualizations available. There are also visualizations available in the Visualization bundle and the Dashboard bundle that include Qlik-supported extension objects. It is also possible to create fully custom visualization extensions or use the ones created by the community. These are, however, out of the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Bar charts</h2>
<p>A bar chart is one<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> of the most common<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> visualization types. It is typically used to compare multiple values. The dimension axis represents the category items that are compared, and the measure axis shows the value of each item. Bar charts are particularly useful when working with discrete or categorical data. In a machine learning context, bar charts are typically used in feature analysis, model evaluation, or class distribution, for example. In our earlier Iris dataset example, we used a bar chart to represent the distribution of predicted Iris species. This chart looks <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer101">
<img alt="Figure 9.1: A bar chart example representing counts of predicted Iris species" height="699" src="image/B19863_09_01.jpg" width="832"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1: A bar chart example representing counts of predicted Iris species</p>
<p>This example represents a simple bar chart. More complex representations include grouped or stacked bars, where multiple categories can be represented at the same time. Grouped bars are good for comparison, while stacked bars can be used to visualize the relationships of subcategories that form <span class="No-Break">a total.</span></p>
<p>For example, grouped bars can be used to compare the sales and forecasts of different years side by side, and stacked bars can be used to analyze the sales of different product categories. In this case, the total height of the bar is the <span class="No-Break">total sales.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Box plots</h2>
<p>Box plots, also <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>known as box-and-whisker plots, are <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>a valuable visualization tool for understanding the distribution and statistical properties of numerical data. Box plots are suitable for comparing ranges and distributions for groups of numerical data, which are illustrated with boxes and whiskers. Whiskers represent the high and low reference values. Box plots can organize a large amount of data and visualize outliers effectively. Typical use cases for box plots with machine learning data include data exploration, feature comparison, and outlier detection. The following example represents the box plot that shows the distribution of average petal length for the <span class="No-Break">predicted species:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer102">
<img alt="Figure 9.2: A box plot example visualizing the average petal length for the predicted species" height="683" src="image/B19863_09_02.jpg" width="833"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2: A box plot example visualizing the average petal length for the predicted species</p>
<p>In Qlik, you can select between the presets for the box plot or define the formula for each component on your own. In the previous graph, we can see that we have some outliers that extend beyond the whiskers, which are represented by the blue dots. We can see that the versicolor has the longest box and whiskers. This tells us that the species predicted to be versicolor in our model has the largest distribution of petal lengths measured. The mean petal length for each predicted species is marked by a horizontal line in<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> <span class="No-Break">each box.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Bullet charts</h2>
<p>Bullet charts are<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> powerful visualization<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> tools that combine the features of a bar chart and a range chart. They provide a compact and informative representation of data, making them useful for comparing actual values against target values and displaying performance metrics. Bullet charts make it possible to compare and measure performance with enriched information. It is a good chart for comparing performance according to target. The following represents an example of a <span class="No-Break">bullet chart:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer103">
<img alt="Figure 9.3: A bullet chart example representing petal lengths" height="621" src="image/B19863_09_03.jpg" width="833"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.3: A bullet chart example representing petal lengths</p>
<p>In this example, we have set the maximum petal length as the target, visualized using a white vertical line. We have set the color scheme to represent the 30% and 70% marks to the target, and the black bar visualizes the average petal length for each <span class="No-Break">iris species.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Distribution plots</h2>
<p>A distribution plot, also<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> known as a density plot, is <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>a useful visualization for understanding the distribution of a numerical variable in a dataset. It displays the probability density of the data across different intervals or bins. With distribution plots, you can visually explore and understand the distributional properties of machine learning data. They provide insights into the shape, central tendency, and variability of numerical variables, aiding in data exploration, feature engineering, and model-building processes. A distribution plot is suitable for comparing ranges and distributions for groups of numerical data. An example can be seen in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer104">
<img alt="Figure 9.4: A distribution plot example representing petal length" height="694" src="image/B19863_09_04.jpg" width="836"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.4: A distribution plot example representing petal length</p>
<p>In this graph, we can see that the individual measurements for petal length are marked with blue dots and the distributions of the measurements are marked with a gray background. We can easily see the construction of the data. In the graph, the bubble size parameter for individual measurements is adjusted to be smaller than the default size to get a clearer graph. If there are a lot of data points, it is also possible to enable jitter. This will separate the individual points using different <span class="No-Break">vertical positions.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Histogram</h2>
<p>Histograms are a<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> common visualization <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>technique used to represent the distribution of numerical data. They provide insights into the frequency or count of values within predefined intervals or bins. They are suitable for showing the distribution of numerical data over an interval or fixed period. Data is divided into bins, and each bar represents the frequency in each bin. In the following example, we are visualizing the frequency and distribution of house values in the <span class="No-Break">California area:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer105">
<img alt="Figure 9.5: A histogram example visualizing the distribution of house values" height="270" src="image/B19863_09_05.jpg" width="792"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.5: A histogram example visualizing the distribution of house values</p>
<p>In this example, we can see that the histogram is slightly tilted to the left. This tells us that most of the houses are valued between 100,000 USD and 300,000 USD, but there are still some houses that are more expensive than this. These form a long “tail” to the right. We can also see that, on average, each price bin has ~31 houses. In Qlik Sense, you can modify the number of bars and colors among many other parameters. In this example, the number of bars has been increased to 200 to get more accurate results from <span class="No-Break">the distribution.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Maps</h2>
<p>Maps in Qlik Sense <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>are an extremely versatile<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> visualization object that can be used in many ways. Maps can contain multiple layers and display different types of information on the same visualization. The best and most natural way to utilize maps is when the data is geography-based, but a map object can also be used to visualize data on top of different backgrounds, such as SVG images. Maps in Qlik support multiple coordinate systems and when combined with the GeoAnalytics Connector, you can perform further calculations with the data. The following example shows an example map with <span class="No-Break">different visualizations:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer106">
<img alt="Figure 9.6: A map example with predicted house values plotted on a map with a gradient color scheme" height="373" src="image/B19863_09_06.jpg" width="958"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.6: A map example with predicted house values plotted on a map with a gradient color scheme</p>
<p>This example<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> visualizes <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>the predicted house values in California on a map. Each point represents a house, and the color indicates the predicted value. A darker color means a house is more expensive. Heatmaps are useful for visualizing the density of the points on a map. In the following example, we have mapped the individual houses in <span class="No-Break">a heatmap:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer107">
<img alt="Figure 9.7: A heatmap example with individual houses plotted" height="467" src="image/B19863_09_07.jpg" width="959"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.7: A heatmap example with individual houses plotted</p>
<p>The darker areas <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>on <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>a heatmap indicate a denser population of houses in that area. Combining different layers into visualizations is an extremely powerful way to present <span class="No-Break">geographical data.</span></p>
<p>In the next example, we can see Tesla’s supercharger stations in Norway that are located within a 300 km driving range along the road network. Driving ranges are calculated using the GeoAnalytics Connector and visualized on <span class="No-Break">a map:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer108">
<img alt="Figure 9.8: A map example showing 300 km driving range from each Tesla supercharger station in Norway" height="512" src="image/B19863_09_08.jpg" width="745"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.8: A map example showing 300 km driving range from each Tesla supercharger station in Norway</p>
<p>As the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>figures show, maps are powerful visualization<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> objects, and they are highly recommended for use with geographical data. In many machine learning solutions, we can place the results onto <span class="No-Break">a map.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Scatter plots</h2>
<p>A scatter plot is <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>a type of data visualization <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>that displays the relationship between two numerical variables. It uses individual data points represented by dots on a two-dimensional plane, with one variable plotted on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. Scatter plots can be used to help identify patterns, correlations, or outliers and assist in selecting features, identifying important variables, and understanding the behavior of the data. Scatter plots are also good for the cross-validation of the data and machine learning models. An example of a scatter plot using the Iris dataset can be seen in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer109">
<img alt="Figure 9.9: A scatter plot example of Iris species by petal width and length" height="415" src="image/B19863_09_09.jpg" width="1271"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.9: A scatter plot example of Iris species by petal width and length</p>
<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>have plotted individual IDs of the Iris flower dataset, with petal width on the vertical axis and petal length on the horizontal axis. We then used the predicted species as a color. This way we can see clear patterns in <span class="No-Break">our data.</span></p>
<p>Scatter plots are also a good visualization type if there are a lot of data points. It will automatically switch to a compressed view if the number of data points exceeds the maximum value. This value can be adjusted in the chart settings. An example of a compressed view is <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer110">
<img alt="Figure 9.10: Scatter plot—compressed view" height="410" src="image/B19863_09_10.jpg" width="788"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.10: Scatter plot—compressed view</p>
<p>The compressed example visualizes the cross-validation of predicted waiting times in an ER unit compared<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> to actual measured waiting<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> times. Relation should be linear, but since we see some outliers, we know that there is still optimization to be done for our actual model in this case. The compressed view shows 64,000 data points in our <span class="No-Break">example graph.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Waterfall charts</h2>
<p>A waterfall <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>chart is<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> a visual representation of how various factors contribute to a final value. They help in understanding the cumulative effect of positive and negative changes in a dataset. While waterfall charts are commonly used in financial analysis, they can also be useful for analyzing and interpreting machine learning data. Waterfall charts are useful when visualizing the SHAP values for a Qlik AutoML model to learn how individual characteristics affect the predicted value. The following example represents the SHAP values of the California <span class="No-Break">housing dataset:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer111">
<img alt="Figure 9.11: A waterfall chart example—SHAP values" height="304" src="image/B19863_09_11.jpg" width="791"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.11: A waterfall chart example—SHAP values</p>
<p>In this example, we can see that <strong class="source-inline">Median income</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Ocean proximity</strong> have large effects on <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>the predicted value. The overall<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> effects of these features are negative, but if we investigate the top predicted prices, we can see that the effect for this group is positive. This is described in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer112">
<img alt="Figure 9.12: SHAP values visualized and filtered for houses with predicted prices over 300,000 USD" height="316" src="image/B19863_09_12.jpg" width="794"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.12: SHAP values visualized and filtered for houses with predicted prices over 300,000 USD</p>
<p>This way, we can study how the different variables are affecting predictions and model behavior. A waterfall chart is a good choice for this specific case since it easily visualizes how various factors <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>contribute to a <span class="No-Break">final</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker601"/></span><span class="No-Break"> value.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">We will cover the full hands-on example using California housing prices data in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Choosing visualization type</h2>
<p>When it comes to <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>visualizing data, a key goal is to present relationships and patterns effectively so that insights can be quickly gleaned. Qlik Sense provides a diverse set of visualizations and charts to cater to various data visualization needs. Each chart has its own strengths in representing data in distinct ways that can be tailored for different <span class="No-Break">analytical purposes.</span></p>
<p>When choosing the <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>appropriate chart for your data, it is crucial to consider the specific insights you aim to derive. Understanding what you want to visualize and the story you want to tell is vital in selecting the most suitable chart type. Different charts emphasize different aspects of the data, such as trends, comparisons, distributions, <span class="No-Break">or relationships.</span></p>
<p>Qlik Sense offers a wide range of visualization options. Each chart type has unique characteristics and functionalities that cater to specific data analysis requirements. For instance, bar charts are effective for comparing categorical data, while line charts are useful for visualizing trends over time. Scatter plots are ideal for showcasing relationships between two variables, and treemaps can effectively illustrate hierarchical <span class="No-Break">data structures.</span></p>
<p>By carefully selecting the right chart types in Qlik Sense, you can leverage the strengths of each visualization to gain meaningful insights from your data. Understanding your data and the questions you want to answer will help you make informed decisions on which charts to utilize to present your data accurately and facilitate <span class="No-Break">data-driven decision-making.</span></p>
<p>In the previous section, we covered some uncommon visualization types with examples and learned why these charts are good for visualizing machine-learning-related data. We did not cover all the charts, and there are a lot of options for tuning all the charts available. The best way to get familiar with different options is to play with the charts yourself. In the next chapter, we will build a few machine learning use cases from scratch and cover some of the chart settings while <span class="No-Break">doing that.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Summary</h1>
<p>Visualizing machine learning data is a crucial step in the data analysis process, enabling you to gain insights, identify patterns, and communicate results effectively. In this chapter, we familiarized ourselves with the different visualizations and techniques to visualize machine learning data. At the beginning of this chapter, we discovered common principles for creating a good visualization and familiarized ourselves with the key principles <span class="No-Break">of coloring.</span></p>
<p>Toward the end of the chapter, we discovered some different visualization types that Qlik offers natively and learned how to use some of the graph types effectively. We learned the principles of the most used visualizations and how to fine-tune these in Qlik while keeping the context of machine learning <span class="No-Break">in mind.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at the actual use cases of the machine learning solutions. We will learn how to build a few different machine learning models and applications from scratch and utilize all we have learned from <span class="No-Break">previous chapters.</span></p>
