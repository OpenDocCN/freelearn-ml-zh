- en: Intelligent machines have been a dream of humankind for a very long time. Even
    if we are far from developing artificial general intelligence, we have made large
    progress in teaching computers to perform difficult tasks, especially those that
    are repetitive and time-consuming for humans.

- en: Machine learning models can help any business to make sense of the available
    data, thus optimizing processes, lowering costs, and generally helping the business
    to plan ahead. Excel users, at all levels of ability, can feel left behind by
    this wave of innovation. Everybody is talking about R and Python as the only relevant
    tools for achieving these tasks. The truth is that a large amount of the work
    needed to develop and use a machine learning model can be done in Excel.

    the relevant concepts clear and understandable. It shows the reader every step
    of a machine learning project, from data collection and reading from different
    data sources, to developing the models and visualizing the results. In every chapter,
    there are several examples and hands-on exercises that show the reader how to
    combine Excel functions, add-ins, and connections to databases and cloud services
    to reach our desired goal: building a full data analysis flow. Different machine
    learning models are demonstrated and tailored to the type of data to be analyzed.'

    Azure Cloud and automated machine learning, which simplify the analysis task and
    represent the future of machine learning.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at data analysts using Excel as their everyday tool, who
    need to go beyond Power Pivot and use add-ins and other advanced tools. Excel
    experts wanting to expand their knowledge to take advantage of the new connection
    possibilities between Excel and Azure will also benefit, as will project managers
    needing to test machine learning models without writing code.

- en: It is generally taken for granted that, in order to do data science, from data
    cleansing to visualization and machine learning models, you need to be a Python
    or R programmer. This is not the case nowadays, and the general tendency seems
    to be heading toward code-free data science. The reader needs to learn that there
    are other options, avoiding code to take Excel to the next level and use it as
    a platform for professional data analysis and visualization.
