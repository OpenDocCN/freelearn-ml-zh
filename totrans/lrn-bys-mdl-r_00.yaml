- en: Bayesian inference provides a unified framework to deal with all sorts of uncertainties
    when learning patterns from data using machine learning models and using it for
    predicting future observations. However, learning and implementing Bayesian models
    is not easy for data science practitioners due to the level of mathematical treatment
    involved. Also, applying Bayesian methods to real-world problems requires high
    computational resources. With the recent advancements in cloud and high-performance
    computing and easy access to computational resources, Bayesian modeling has become
    more feasible to use for practical applications today. Therefore, it would be
    advantageous for all data scientists and data engineers to understand Bayesian
    methods and apply them in their projects to achieve better results.

- en: This book gives comprehensive coverage of the Bayesian machine learning models
    and the R packages that implement them. It begins with an introduction to the
    fundamentals of probability theory and R programming for those who are new to
    the subject. Then, the book covers some of the most important machine learning
    methods, both supervised learning and unsupervised learning, implemented using
    Bayesian inference and R. Every chapter begins with a theoretical description
    of the method, explained in a very simple manner. Then, relevant R packages are
    discussed and some illustrations using datasets from the UCI machine learning
    repository are given. Each chapter ends with some simple exercises for you to
    get hands-on experience of the concepts and R packages discussed in the chapter.
    The state-of-the-art topics covered in the chapters are Bayesian regression using
    linear and generalized linear models, Bayesian classification using logistic regression,
    classification of text data using Naïve Bayes models, and Bayesian mixture models
    and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet allocation.

- en: The last two chapters are devoted to the latest developments in the field. One
    chapter discusses deep learning, which uses a class of neural network models that
    are currently at the frontier of artificial intelligence. The book concludes with
    the application of Bayesian methods on Big Data using frameworks such as Hadoop
    and Spark.

- en: This book is intended for data scientists who analyze large datasets to generate
    insights and for data engineers who develop platforms, solutions, or applications
    based on machine learning. Although many data science practitioners are quite
    familiar with machine learning techniques and R, they may not know about Bayesian
    inference and its merits. This book, therefore, would be helpful to even experienced
    data scientists and data engineers to learn about Bayesian methods and incorporate
    them in to their projects to get better results. No prior experience is required
    in R or probability theory to use this book.
