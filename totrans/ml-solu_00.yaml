- en: This book, titled Machine Learning Solutions, gives you a broad idea about the
    topic. As a reader, you will get the chance to learn how to develop cutting-edge
    data science applications using various Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This
    book is practical guide that can help you to build and optimize your data science
    applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We learn things by practically doing them. Practical implementations of various
    Machine Learning techniques, tips and tricks, optimization techniques, and so
    on will enhance your understanding in the ML and data science application development
    domains.

- en: Now let me answer one of the most common questions I have heard from my friends
    and colleagues so frequently about ML and the data science application development
    front. This question is what really inspired me to write this book. For me, it's
    really important that all my readers get an idea of why am I writing this book.
    Let's find out that questionâ€¦!

    learning application?" The answer includes lots of things that people should take

    want to build this application?
  prefs:

    organization. This will clarify to you the technical aspect and business aspect
    of the application.

- en: Check whether the dataset is having labels or not. If it is a labeled dataset,
    then you can apply supervised algorithms; if it is not labeled, then apply unsupervised
    algorithms. Your problem statement is a regression problem or classification problem.

    the accuracy.

    the accuracy of the base line approach is not good." It's ok!

- en: Try to list down all the possible problems that you can think your base-line
    approach has. Be honest about the problems.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now solve the problems one by one and measure the accuracy. If the accuracy
    is improving, then move forward in that direction; otherwise try out other solutions
    that eventually solve the shortcomings of the base line approach and improve the
    accuracy.

    get a new and definite direction, which will lead you to the best possible solution
    as well as accuracy.

- en: I have covered all the specified aspects in this book. Here, the major goal
    is how readers will get a state-of-the-art result for their own data science problem
    using ML algorithms, and in order to achieve that, we will use only the bare necessary
    theory and many hands-on examples of different domains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will cover the analytics domain, NLP domain, and computer vision domain.
    These examples are all industry problems and readers will learn how to get the
    best result. After reading this book, readers will apply their new skills to any
    sort of industry problem to achieve best possible for their machine learning applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical reader will have a basic to intermediate knowledge of undergraduate
    mathematics, such as probabilities, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra.
    No advanced mathematics is required as the book will be mostly self-contained.
    Basic to intermediate knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is required.
    No advance concepts of machine learning are required as the book will be mostly
    self-contained. A decent knowledge in Python is required too as it would be out-of-scope
    to go through an introduction to Python but each procedure will be explained step-by-step
    to be reproducible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is full if practical examples. The reader wants to know about how
    to apply the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real life data science applications
    efficiently. This book starts from the basic ML techniques which can be used to
    develop base-line approach. After that readers learn how to apply optimization
    techniques for each application in order to achieve the state-of-the-art result.
    For each application, I have specified the basic concepts, tips and tricks along
    with the code.
