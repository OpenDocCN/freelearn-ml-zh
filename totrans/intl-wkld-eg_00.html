			<p>The <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) has transformed how businesses think about and interact with the world. Sensors can measure the performance of high-volume industrial manufacturing operations or the daily environmental health of a remote island. The IoT makes it possible to study the world at various levels of precision and enable data-driven decision making anywhere. <strong class="bold">Machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) and Elastic cloud computing have accelerated our ability to understand and analyze the huge amount of data generated by the IoT. With edge computing, data analytics and ML models can process information locally at the source where the data is generated.</p>
			<p>This book will teach you to combine the technologies of edge computing and machine learning to deliver next-generation cyber-physical outcomes. You'll begin by discovering how to create software applications that run on edge devices using software from Amazon Web Services, such as AWS IoT Greengrass. As you advance, you'll learn how to process and stream IoT data from the edge to the cloud and use it to train ML models using Amazon SageMaker. The book also shows you how to optimize these models and run them at the edge for optimal performance, cost savings, and data compliance.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to scope your own IoT workloads, bring the power of machine learning to the edge, and operate those workloads in a production setting.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for IoT architects and software engineers responsible for delivering analytical and machine learning-backed software solutions to the edge. Amazon Web Services users who want to learn and build IoT solutions will find this book useful. Intermediate experience with running Python software on Linux is required to make the most of this book.</p>

It also offers ideas on the next steps for IoT architects to take given the lessons learned from this book.</p>
			<p>To get the most out of this book</p>
			<p>You will need a personal computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux. This computer uses the AWS Command Line Interface in a terminal and the AWS Management Console through a web browser. A second, Linux-based system acts as the edge device and hosts the edge solution running AWS IoT Greengrass. This second system can be a local or remote virtual machine or an actual device like a Raspberry Pi. For the real IoT experience, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi 3B (or later) with a SenseHAT expansion board to complete the hands-on portions of the book. If you do not have a hardware device, you can use an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine instead. Ultimately, you can finish all hands-on steps with or without a second device.</p>
			<p>The use of AWS for cloud-based services does incur a small cost. You will need access to an AWS account or create one yourself. Completion of all hands-on sections can accrue billing up to $25 US Dollars (USD). You can opt out of the ML training steps to reduce the cost to less than $5. </p>

			<p>At the time of authoring, AWS IoT Greengrass v2 did not support Windows installation. The hands-on portions related to the edge solution are specific to Linux and do not run on Windows.</p>
