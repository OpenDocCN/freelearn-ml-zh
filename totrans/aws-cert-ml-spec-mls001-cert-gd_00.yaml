- en: The AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification exam tests your competency
    to perform **machine** **learning** (**ML**) on AWS infrastructure. This book
    covers the entire exam syllabus in depth using practical examples to help you
    with your real-world machine learning projects on AWS.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting with an introduction to machine learning on AWS, you'll learn the fundamentals
    of machine learning and explore important AWS services for **artificial intelligence**
    (**AI**). You'll then see how to prepare data for machine learning and discover
    different techniques for data manipulation and transformation for different types
    of variables. The book also covers the handling of missing data and outliers and
    takes you through various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression,
    clustering, forecasting, anomaly detection, text mining, and image processing,
    along with their specific ML algorithms, that you should know to pass the exam.
    Finally, you'll explore model evaluation, optimization, and deployment and get
    to grips with deploying models in a production environment and monitoring them.

    machine learning and the solutions that AWS has released for each of them, along
    with the tools, methods, and techniques commonly used in each domain of AWS machine
    learning.
