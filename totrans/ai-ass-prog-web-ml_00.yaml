- en: '*Chapter 1*, *It’s a New World, One with AI Assistants, and You’re Invited*,
    looks at how we started using large language models and how it constitutes a paradigm
    shift for many, not just IT workers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Prompt Strategy*, explains the strategy used throughout the book
    in terms of breaking down a problem and some guiding principles on how to effectively
    prompt your chosen AI tool.'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Tools of the Trade: Introducing Our AI Assistants*, is where
    we explain how to work with our two chosen AI assistants, GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT,
    covering everything from installation to how to get started using them.'

    on building the frontend for our e-commerce app (a narrative you will see featured
    throughout the book).'

    e-commerce app using JavaScript.'

- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Support Multiple Viewports Using Responsive Web Layouts*, is
    where we address the fact that an app needs to work for different device types,
    whether it’s a smaller mobile screen, a tablet, or a desktop screen. Therefore,
    this chapter focuses on responsive design.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Build a Backend with Web APIs*, looks at how, for the app to
    actually work, it needs to have a backend, consisting of code that’s able to read
    and write data and persist it. This chapter therefore focuses on building a Web
    API for our e-commerce app.'

- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Augment Web apps with AI Services*, covers training a machine
    learning model and how to expose it via a Web API for consumption by anyone with
    a browser or other type of client capable of using the HTTP protocol.'

- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Maintaining Existing Codebases*, covers how most developers
    work on existing code and maintain existing codebases rather than creating new
    projects. Therefore, this chapter focuses on various aspects of maintaining code,
    like dealing with bugs, performance, working with tests, and more.'
