<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref07"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many notable books on machine learning, from pedagogical tracts on the theory of learning from data; to standard references on specializations in the field, such as clustering and outlier detection or probabilistic graph modeling; to cookbooks that offer practical advice on the use of tools and libraries in a particular language. The books that tend to be broad in coverage are often short on theoretical detail, while those with a focus on one topic or tool may not, for example, have much to say about the difference in approach in a streaming as opposed to a batch environment. Besides, for the non-novices with a preference for tools in Java who wish to reach for a single volume that will extend their knowledge—simultaneously, on the essential aspects—there are precious few options.</p><p>Finding in one place</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The pros and cons of different techniques given any data availability scenario—when data is labeled or unlabeled, streaming or batch, local, or distributed, structured or unstructured</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A ready reference for the most important mathematical results related to those very techniques for a better appreciation of the underlying theory</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An introduction to the most mature Java-based frameworks, libraries, and visualization tools with descriptions and illustrations on how to put these techniques into practice is not possible today, as far as we know</li></ul></div><p>The core idea of this book, therefore, is to address this gap while maintaining a balance between treatment of theory and practice with the aid of probability, statistics, basic linear algebra, and rudimentary calculus in the service of one, and emphasizing methodology, case studies, tools and code in support of the other.</p><p>According to the KDnuggets 2016 software poll, Java, at 16.8%, has the second highest share in popularity among languages used in machine learning, after Python. What's more is that this marks a 19% increase from the year before! Clearly, Java remains an important and effective vehicle to build and deploy systems involving machine learning, despite claims of its decline in some quarters. With this book, we aim to reach professionals and motivated enthusiasts with some experience in Java and a beginner's knowledge of machine learning. Our goal is to make <span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Java Machine Learning</em></span> the next step on their path to becoming advanced practitioners in data science. To guide them on this path, the book covers a veritable arsenal of techniques in machine learning—some which they may already be familiar with, others perhaps not as much, or only superficially—including methods of data analysis, learning algorithms, evaluation of model performance, and more in supervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering and anomaly detection, and semi-supervised and active learning. It also presents special topics such as probabilistic graph modeling, text mining, and deep learning. Not forgetting the increasingly important topics in enterprise-scale systems today, the book also covers the unique challenges of learning from evolving data streams and the tools and techniques applicable to real-time systems, as well as the imperatives of the world of Big Data:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How does machine learning work in large-scale distributed environments?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What are the trade-offs?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How must algorithms be adapted?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How can these systems interoperate with other technologies in the dominant Hadoop ecosystem?</li></ul></div><p>This book explains how to apply machine learning to real-world data and real-world domains with the right methodology, processes, applications, and analysis. Accompanying each chapter are case studies and examples of how to apply the newly learned techniques using some of the best available open source tools written in Java. This book covers more than 15 open source Java tools supporting a wide range of techniques between them, with code and practical usage. The code, data, and configurations are available for readers to download and experiment with. We present more than ten real-world case studies in Machine Learning that illustrate the data scientist's process. Each case study details the steps undertaken in the experiments: data ingestion, data analysis, data cleansing, feature reduction/selection, mapping to machine learning, model training, model selection, model evaluation, and analysis of results. This gives the reader a practical guide to using the tools and methods presented in each chapter for solving the business problem at hand.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Machine Learning Review">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Machine Learning Review</em></span>, is a refresher of basic concepts and techniques that the reader would have learned from Packt's <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning Machine Learning in Java</em></span> or a similar text. This chapter is a review of concepts such as data, data transformation, sampling and bias, features and their importance, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, big data learning, stream and real-time learning, probabilistic graphic models, and semi-supervised learning.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Practical Approach to Real-World Supervised Learning">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Practical Approach to Real-World Supervised Learning</em></span>, cobwebs dusted, dives straight into the vast field of supervised learning and the full spectrum of associated techniques. We cover the topics of feature selection and reduction, linear modeling, logistic models, non-linear models, SVM and kernels, ensemble learning techniques such as bagging and boosting, validation techniques and evaluation metrics, and model selection. Using WEKA and RapidMiner, we carry out a detailed case study, going through all the steps from data analysis to analysis of model performance. As in each of the other chapters, the case study is presented as an example to help the reader understand how the techniques introduced in the chapter are applied in real life. The dataset used in the case study is UCI HorseColic.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques</em></span>, presents many advanced methods in clustering and outlier techniques, with applications. Topics covered are feature selection and reduction in unsupervised data, clustering algorithms, evaluation methods in clustering, and anomaly detection using statistical, distance, and distribution techniques. At the end of the chapter, we perform a case study for both clustering and outlier detection using a real-world image dataset, MNIST. We use the Smile API to do feature reduction and ELKI for learning.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Semi-Supervised and Active Learning">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Semi-supervised Learning and Active Learning</em></span>, gives details of algorithms and techniques for learning when only a small amount labeled data is present.

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book assumes you have some experience of programming in Java and a basic understanding of machine learning concepts. If that doesn't apply to you, but you are curious nonetheless and self-motivated, fret not, and read on! For those who do have some background, it means that you are familiar with simple statistical analysis of data and concepts involved in supervised and unsupervised learning. Those who may not have the requisite math or must poke the far reaches of their memory to shake loose the odd formula or funny symbol, do not be disheartened. If you are the sort that loves a challenge, the short primer in the appendices may be all you need to kick-start your engines—a bit of tenacity will see you through the rest! For those who have never been introduced to machine learning, the first chapter was equally written for you as for those needing a refresher—it is your starter-kit to jump in feet first and find out what it's all about. You can augment your basics with any number of online resources. Finally, for those innocent of Java, here's a secret: many of the tools featured in the book have powerful GUIs. Some include wizard-like interfaces, making them quite easy to use, and do not require any knowledge of Java. So if you are new to Java, just skip the examples that need coding and learn to use the GUI-based tools instead!</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>The primary audience of this book is professionals who works with data and whose responsibilities may include data analysis, data visualization or transformation, the training, validation, testing and evaluation of machine learning models—presumably to perform predictive, descriptive or prescriptive analytics using Java or Java-based tools. The choice of Java may imply a personal preference and therefore some prior experience programming in Java. On the other hand, perhaps circumstances in the work environment or company policies limit the use of third-party tools to only those written in Java and a few others. In the second case, the prospective reader may have no programming experience in Java. This book is aimed at this reader just as squarely as it is at their colleague, the Java expert (who came up with the policy in the first place).</p><p>A secondary audience can be defined by a profile with two attributes alone: an intellectual curiosity about machine learning and the desire for a single comprehensive treatment of the concepts, the practical techniques, and the tools. A specimen of this type of reader can opt to skip the math and the tools and focus on learning the most common supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms alone. Another might skim over <span class="emphasis"><em>Chapters 1, 2, 3,</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>7,</em></span> skip the others entirely, and jump headlong into the tools—a perfectly reasonable strategy if you want to quickly make yourself useful analyzing that dataset the client said would be here any day now. Importantly, too, with some practice reproducing the experiments from the book, it'll get you asking the right questions of the gurus! Alternatively, you might want to use this book as a reference to quickly look up the details of the algorithm for affinity propagation (<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques</em></span>), or remind yourself of an LSTM architecture with a brief review of the schematic (<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Deep Learning">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deep Learning</em></span>), or dog-ear the page with the list of pros and cons of distance-based clustering methods for outlier detection in stream-based learning (<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Real-Time Stream Machine Learning">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Real-Time Stream Machine Learning</em></span>). All specimens are welcome and each will find plenty to sink their teeth into.</p></div>
