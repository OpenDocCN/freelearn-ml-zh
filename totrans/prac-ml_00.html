Machine learning and predictive analytics have become the most important approaches to uncover data gold mines. Machine learning uses complex algorithms to make improved predictions of outcomes based on historical patterns and the behavior of datasets. Machine learning can deliver dynamic insights into trends, patterns, and relationships within data, which is immensely valuable to the growth and development of business.</p><p>With this book, you will not only learn the fundamentals of Machine learning, but you will also dive deep into the complexities of the real-world data before moving onto using Hadoop and its wider ecosystem of tools to process and manage your structured and unstructured data.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Regression based learning">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Regression based learning</em></span>, will cover regression analysis-based Machine learning and in specific, how to implement linear and logistic regression models using Mahout, R, Python, Julia, and Spark. Additionally, we will cover other related concepts of statistics such as variance, covariance, ANOVA, among others. We will also cover regression models in depth with examples to understand how to apply it to the real-world problems.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Deep learning">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deep learning</em></span>, will cover the model for a biological neuron and will explain how an artificial neuron is related to its function. You will learn the core concepts of neural networks and understand how fully-connected layers work. We will also explore some key activation functions that are used in conjunction with matrix multiplication.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Reinforcement learning">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Reinforcement learning</em></span>, will explore a new learning technique called reinforcement learning. We will see how this is different from the traditional supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. We will also explore the elements of MDP and learn about it using an example.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Ensemble learning">Chapter 13</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em>Ensemble learning</em></span>, will cover the ensemble learning methods of Machine learning. In specific, we will look at some supervised ensemble learning techniques with some real-world examples.
