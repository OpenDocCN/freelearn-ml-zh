<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The paths to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1411"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">adopting and maturing AI/ML can vary for organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">As an ML solutions architect, I have collaborated with organizations at different stages of AI/ML adoption and with varying levels of ML experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">Understanding what organizations look like at different stages of the AI/ML journey can help decision-makers prioritize what’s important at each stage, identify the challenges an organization may face, and determine what needs to be done to move to the next level.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Based on my experience working with various organizations, I have observed that companies generally fall into the following stages.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-379"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Exploring AI/ML</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Companies in</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1412"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> this stage are those that are just beginning to delve into the world of AI/ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">They usually don’t have any prior experience with AI/ML, but they recognize its promising potential and are eager to explore its impact on their business.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">These companies often face several challenges as they attempt to assess the impact of AI/ML on their business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">One of the biggest challenges is identifying the right AI/ML project to showcase its value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">With so many potential applications of AI/ML, it can be difficult for these companies to determine the best place to start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">They may struggle with choosing the right problem to solve or the right data set to use.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Another challenge for companies in this stage is acquiring the necessary business and technical expertise to execute a pilot project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">AI/ML is a complex field that requires a high level of technical expertise and experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">These companies may need to hire or train new employees or work with outside partners to gain the necessary knowledge and skills.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Despite these challenges, companies in this stage have a great opportunity to learn about the potential of AI/ML and to lay the foundation for a successful AI/ML integration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">By starting with a pilot project, they can gain valuable experience and insights into the potential of AI/ML, and they can begin to build the necessary skills and expertise to support future AI/ML initiatives.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Most of the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1413"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1"> customers I worked with four or more years ago fell into this category, and the interest and initiative mostly came from senior business and technology leaders, such as VPs or directors of engineering, and heads of business functions like marketing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Successful companies at this stage usually began with use cases that solved real business problems and delivered measurable benefits that resonated with other stakeholders in the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">For example, one organization I worked with started with a sports analytics use case that addressed a labor-intensive task, resulting in lower costs and faster delivery of insights. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4">On the other hand, another organization started with a forward-looking use case that required significant ROI analysis and process changes, but it failed to take off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.5">Since these organizations usually didn’t have in-house ML expertise, the successful ones typically chose to work with partners who had ML experience to get a proof of concept or pilot off the ground. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.6">At this stage, ML technology stack and infrastructure efficiency were usually not a focus for these organizations, as the main goal was to prove business value.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-380"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Disjointed AI/ML</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Organizations </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1414"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">in this stage often focus on adopting AI/ML more broadly across business areas based on some early successes and formulating a long-term strategic AI/ML vision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">These organizations normally have varying degrees of AI/ML capabilities within different departments but lack a cohesive, enterprise-wide strategy for AI/ML, and most likely do not have an enterprise ML platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Each department operates its AI/ML initiatives independently, using AI/ML to meet specific business requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">There is limited collaboration and sharing between departments, leading to siloed data and AI/ML efforts.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">These organizations often face challenges when it comes to scaling and executing AI/ML initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">One of the biggest challenges is a lack of dedicated ML engineering support. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">Data scientists are expected to be proficient in both science and engineering, and they may face technical challenges that span both domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">Another challenge faced by these organizations is the lack of an ML governance process, resulting in low confidence and adoption in the models being developed, many science projects, and no real production workload.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">As organizations in this stage continue to scale their AI/ML efforts across more business areas, they should think about establishing more cohesive and integrated AI/ML efforts, such as ML platform and technology standardization, unified development and governance processes, organization alignment, reuse of data and models, and knowledge sharing.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Fast-forwarding</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> to today, the majority of organizations I work with fall into this category. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Many of these organizations have limited oversight to validate the business benefits of these initiatives in the different silos, which has resulted in many of these projects becoming science experiments rather than business-outcome-driven initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">In addition, the lack of dedicated effort in business process integration has resulted in many projects not making it into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">To move forward from this stage, some of the organizations I worked with have started initiatives to rationalize their AI/ML efforts, including both organizational and technological rationalization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.5">For example, several organizations I worked with have established a new Chief Data Officer function to oversee data, analytics, and ML initiatives across the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.6">They started to formulate a multi-year strategy to move toward a more integrated organization and technology stack. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.7">Many of these organizations have also created dedicated engineering functions to drive technical standards and common ML infrastructure.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-381"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Integrated AI/ML</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Companies </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1416"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">in this stage understand the importance of AI/ML for their business and have taken steps to fully integrate AI/ML into their operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">They have established a clear organizational structure to support AI/ML initiatives from both a business and technical perspective.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">These companies have invested in enterprise-grade ML and data infrastructure to support experimentation and production deployment across multiple business units. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">They have consolidated siloed technology efforts where it makes sense and established ML governance and security as critical concerns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">They have put in place specific governance capabilities, such as AI/ML policies and procedures, defined roles and responsibilities, and enabled technology capabilities for governance.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">As a result of their comprehensive approach to AI/ML, these organizations have seen a range of benefits, including cost savings, risk reduction, improved user experiences, and faster ML deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">AI/ML has become an integral part of their business operations, and they continue to invest in and develop their AI/ML capabilities to stay ahead of the curve.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Among the organizations that I have have worked with, the number in this stage is still small, with most of them still evolving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">More mature organizations in this stage have also invested in AI/ML adoption efforts for both their businesses and technology platforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">For </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">example, a number of organizations have established dedicated solution engineering teams that work with different lines of businesses to adopt their enterprise ML platform and onboard AI/ML workloads. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Some organizations have also established enterprise-wide AI/ML conferences/summits to drive internal knowledge sharing on use cases, business values, best practices, and innovations.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-382"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Advanced AI/ML</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Companies</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1"> in the “Advanced AI/ML” stage have fully embraced AI/ML as a key part of their business operations and have achieved a high level of proficiency in incorporating AI/ML into their products and services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">They are leaders in the industry and are pioneers in AI/ML research and real-world applications of AI/ML, helping to shape the direction of the broader industry.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">These companies have the capability to generate AI/ML-driven disruptive business concepts and products that have a lasting impact on the industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">They possess a deep understanding of AI/ML and are able to use this knowledge to drive innovation and stay ahead of the curve.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">In addition, these companies have a well-established ML infrastructure and governance system, which allows them to quickly experiment with new AI/ML models and to bring new products and services to market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">They are also able to effectively manage the risks associated with AI/ML and ensure that their applications meet regulatory and ethical standards.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">I have worked with several organizations at this stage, primarily in the financial services and high-tech industries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">These organizations have not only adopted state-of-the-art ML technology, fostered a data-driven culture, and developed a strong AI/ML product and solution mindset but have also established AI/ML research functions to help advance AI/ML research with a potential industry-wide impact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">Examples of such research include financial market simulation, AI/ML security, and privacy.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">I once worked with an engineering leadership at an organization that aimed to introduce AI capabilities into their customer support workflow to increase the cross-sell and upsell of the company’s products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">The team had an idea to use AI to extract insights from call transcripts to identify customer intent and recommend new products based on the customer’s profile and intent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">A lot of analysis was conducted on the business benefits, operations workflows, and potential solution architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.4">While the idea made sense in concept, it failed to account for other factors including business changes in downstream organizations and systems, a lack of cross-functional stakeholders, buy-in, and misalignment with the core customer engagement model for its products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.5">As a result the project failed to secure funding as the perceived business benefit did not justify the investment and change management required.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">In another project I was involved in, an organization sought to use ML to maximize the return of their advertising budget by predicting the likelihood of users clicking on ad impressions and the potential value of the users. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">A financial analysis was conducted and a business case was written on the proposal, and the project was given the green light to move forward as a pilot. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">However, the execution team refused to use any outside assistance, even though the team had very limited data science experience in this area – they opted to learn on the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">As a result, the project moved very slowly, as the team had to do many time-consuming experiments on the data science and engineering approaches to validate any assumptions and decisions they came across. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.4">While the team was eventually able to develop a working pilot after significant delays, it did not deliver the anticipated business lift, and no further funding was allocated to continue the project.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">One of the organizations I engaged with had several ideas for improving their fan engagement experience using AI-enabled analytics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">The organization did not have any ML experience on this topic but was open to working with a partner who had ML competency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">The team collectively analyzed the technical feasibility and business benefits of each of the ideas, the data availability and quality, and the change management required for both business workflow and upstream and downstream systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.4">The decision was to go with an idea that had a high degree of being successful in model outcome and adoption. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.5">The idea also resonated with internal stakeholders as they could relate to the idea. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.6">The pilot was successfully executed with the expected outcome </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1452"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">and a longer-term vision and plan were established to extend the adoption of AI/ML, and a talent upskill program was put in place to develop in-house talent for future projects.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">In summary, getting started with the first AI/ML project can be a challenging task for many organizations and the success or failure of the first pilot can have a significant impact on the future direction of AI/ML adoption within an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">The following are some of the key best practices to follow when starting your first AI/ML pilot:</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">To mitigate</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1463"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1"> these risks and challenges, many mature organizations choose to implement enterprise-grade ML platforms to support their increasing ML project demands and manage risk and compliance more thoroughly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">Depending on the current state of their ML infrastructure, organizations may face different scaling challenges and choose different paths to expand their technology infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">Next, I will outline the various considerations and paths for scaling technology and governance frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">For organizations without standard ML tools and infrastructure in place, the recommended path for scaling is to invest in standard ML infrastructure and tools and establish dedicated teams to build and manage the infrastructure and tools, and drive their adoption. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">Depending on the business needs and organization structure, the scope of ML infrastructure and team investment can vary to support the needs of a functional department, a line of business, or the entire enterprise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">Through my experience working with various organizations, I have seen firsthand the benefits of implementing a standardized ML platform to meet growing needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.3">Here are some of the best practices and considerations to keep in mind when embarking on the path of building an ML platform and driving its adoption.</span></p>
<h4 class="heading-4"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">Creating a blueprint</span></h4>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">Creating a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1464"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">clear blueprint for an ML platform is an important step in the implementation process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">The blueprint should outline the key features and capabilities of the platform, the target audience and users, and how the platform will integrate into existing business workflows and systems.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">The first step in creating a blueprint is to identify the key features and capabilities of the ML platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">This should include a detailed description of the platform capabilities, such as experimentation, training, hosting, the data sources that will be integrated, and the user interfaces and tools that will be provided. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.3">It is also important to consider managing models post deployment, the scalability and reliability of the platform, and any security and privacy concerns that may need to be addressed.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Next, the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1465"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1"> blueprint should outline the target audience and users of the platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">This should include a detailed description of the role and responsibilities of each user, as well as the specific requirements and needs of each user group. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">This information can be used to design the user interface and tools and to ensure that the platform meets the needs of all users.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Finally, the blueprint should describe how the ML platform will integrate into existing business workflows and systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">This includes identifying the data sources that will be used, and how data will be collected, processed, and stored. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">It also includes identifying the systems and applications that will need to be integrated, and how the ML platform will interact with these systems.</span></p>
