    celebratory product sales, there will always be impacts on the marketing outcomes
    from time components. For example, companies selling umbrellas will naturally
    see significant sales increases during rainy seasons. Not only can there be seasonal
    impacts on businesses but there can also be general trends in businesses. For
    example, businesses selling landline phones will see a gradual decline in their
    sales as people use mobile phones more and more.

    and how to utilize them for the most efficient marketing strategies. We will introduce
    the basics of time-series analysis, such as some of the common approaches to identifying
    overall trends and anomalies and visualizing time-series data. We’ll then move
    on to exploring how time-series data can be decomposed into trends and seasonalities,
    which will inform us of the contribution of breakdowns of certain events based
    on these factors and how this decomposition helps with building more efficient
    marketing strategies. We’ll end by learning how to build time-series forecasting
    models and understanding how these forecasts can be utilized for proper marketing
    campaigns. We will use a product sales dataset as an example and discuss how to
    conduct time-series analysis and modeling in Python.

    temporal component of the business cycle. In the fashion industry, clothing businesses
    typically market spring and summer clothes from late winter to early spring, while
    fall and winter clothes are advertised from early summer to early fall, as customers
    tend to shop before the actual season comes as a preparation. Then, spring and
    summer clothes typically go on sale during the summer, typically from mid-July,
    as the demand for these clothes is low during the actual season. This illustrates
    how businesses can optimize their business cycles for different seasons based
    on the customer demands that naturally form and how they can maximize sales while
    minimizing the excess inventory.

    and the y-axis is the degree of correlation. This chart shows the correlation
    between the current point of time against one period before, two periods before,
    and up to 25 periods before. Here, in the monthly sales data, we have relatively
    strong positive correlations up to three lagged periods and slight negative correlations
    with the fourth and fifth periods. This suggests that if there were increases
    in sales for the past 3 months, it is likely that the current month’s sales will
    increase, and vice versa. Also, this means that observing an increase in sales
    4–5 months ago likely results in a decrease in sales during the current month.
    As this example shows, autocorrelation is a way to see how different time periods
    may have affected the current time period’s result. In the *Time series forecasting
    models* section of this chapter, we will experiment with the **autoregressive
    integrated moving average** (**ARIMA**) model, and the autoregression part of

    to the previous autoregression chart. This is due to the fact that partial autoregression
    measures the direct correlation at each lag, whereas autoregression includes the
    influence of intermediate lags. In this example, we can see that there is a significant
    positive partial autocorrelation at lag 1 and a negative partial autocorrelation
    at lag 4\. This suggests that the prior month’s increase or decrease in sales
    is likely to result in an increase and decrease in the current month’s sales,
    respectively, whereas the increase in sales 4 months ago is likely to result in
    a decrease in the current month’s sales, excluding the influences of the sales
    results in the months between. Intuitively, these can be a result of natural business

    its applications for marketing. From fundamental analyses of how data progresses
    over time and what stories and insights can be gathered from such analyses to
    the development of advanced time-series forecasting models, we have touched on
    a wide range of topics in time-series analysis. We have seen how moving averages
    and autocorrelations and visualizations of them play a critical role in understanding
    the big picture of events happening over time. We have also covered how time-series
    data can be decomposed into trends and seasonalities that uncover the hidden insights
    of cycles within businesses and different product lines. Lastly, we have experimented
    with two of the frequently used statistical methods of modeling the time-series
    data and how to make forecasts for the future that can then be used for more efficient
    and timely marketing campaigns. Although not discussed in depth in this chapter,
    we have shared some of the other AI/ML models that are used and are in development.
    Make sure you check out this chapter’s GitHub repository for an example of building
    a DL model for time-series forecasting. We will also go deeper into DL and Generative
    AI later, in Part IV of this book.

    you can benefit from it for your next marketing initiatives. We will be discussing
    how to use and apply some of the NLP techniques using sentiment analysis as an
    example and how it can equip marketers to gauge the public perception of the brand
    or products and monitor and refine the marketing messages for better alignment
    with customer preferences.
