- en: In [Chapter 2](4ec4e82a-b63d-4fc1-bf3b-47c653c25a79.xhtml)*, Searching for Luxury
    Accommodations Worldwide*, we wrote a file, `WxUtils.py`, that contains a utility
    function, `wxBitmapFromCvImage`, to convert OpenCV images to wxPython bitmaps.
    We used this utility function in our Python projects throughout this book.

- en: 'Our implementation of `wxBitmapFromCvImage` relied in part on wxPython''s `wx.BitmapFromBuffer` function.
    On some versions of Raspberry Pi and Raspbian, `wx.BitmapFromBuffer` suffers from
    a platform-specific bug that causes it to fail. As a workaround, we can do a less
    efficient, two-step conversion using the `wx.ImageFromBuffer` and `wx.BitmapFromImage` functions.
    Here is some code to check whether we are running on an early model of Raspbperry
    Pi (based on the CPU model) and to implement our `wxBitmapFromCVImage` function
    appropriately:'

    our `wxBitmapFromCvImage` utility function will work on Raspberry Pi, as well
    as other systems.
