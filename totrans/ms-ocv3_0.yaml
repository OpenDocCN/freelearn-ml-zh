- en: '*Mastering OpenCV3, Second Edition* contains seven chapters, where each chapter
    is a tutorial for an entire project from start to finish, based on OpenCV''s C++
    interface, including the full source code. The author of each chapter was chosen
    for their well-regarded online contributions to the OpenCV community on that topic,
    and the book was reviewed by one of the main OpenCV developers. Rather than explaining
    the basics of OpenCV functions, this book shows how to apply OpenCV to solve whole
    problems, including several 3D camera projects (augmented reality, and 3D structure
    from Motion) and several facial analysis projects (such as skin detection, simple
    face and eye detection, complex facial feature tracking, 3D head orientation estimation,
    and face recognition), therefore it makes a great companion to the existing OpenCV
    books.'

    both a desktop application and a Raspberry Pi that automatically generates a cartoon
    or painting from a real camera image, with several possible types of cartoons,
    including a skin color changer.'

    from Motion Using OpenCV*, contains an introduction to Structure from Motion (SfM)
    via an implementation of SfM concepts in OpenCV. The reader will learn how to
    reconstruct 3D geometry from multiple 2D images and estimate camera positions.'

    build an automatic number plate recognition application using pattern recognition
    algorithms and also using a support vector machine and Artificial Neural Networks.
    The reader will learn how to train and predict pattern-recognition algorithms
    to decide whether an image is a number plate or not. It will also help classify
    a set of features into a character.'

    Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are and how to create them with OpenCV using a
    set of face frames with different facial expressions. Besides, this chapter explains
    how to match a given frame through fitting capabilities offered by AAMs. Then,
    by applying the POSIT algorithm, one can find the 3D head pose.'
