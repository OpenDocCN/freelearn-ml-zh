    tongue are continuously gathering various forms of data which the brain translates
    to sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. The brain then processes various forms
    of raw data it receives through sensory organs and translates it to speech, which
    is used to express opinion about the nature of raw data received.

    nature. However, certain responses are qualitative in nature. Responses such as
    attitudes (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree) are
    qualitative in nature. Predicting a qualitative response for an observation can
    be referred to as classifying that observation, since it involves assigning the
    observation to a category or class. Classifiers are an invaluable tool for many
    tasks today, such as medical or genomics predictions, spam detection, face recognition,
    and finance.

    (typically a vector) and an output variable (also called the supervisory signal)
    and applying this mapping to predict the outputs for unseen data. Supervised methods
    attempt to discover the relationship between input variables and target variables.
    The relationship discovered is represented in a structure referred to as a model.
    Usually models describe and explain phenomena, which are hidden in the dataset
    and can be used for predicting the value of the target attribute knowing the values
    of the input attributes.

    supervised training data (set of training examples). The training data consists
    of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair
    consisting of an input object and a desired output value. A supervised learning
    algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function.

- en: Unsupervised learning studies how systems can learn to represent particular
    input patterns in a way that reflects the statistical structure of the overall
    collection of input patterns. Unsupervised learning is important since it is likely
    to be much more common in the brain than supervised learning. For example, the
    activities of photoreceptors in the eyes are constantly changing with the visual
    world. They go on to provide all the information that is available to indicate
    what objects there are in the world, how they are presented, what the lighting
    conditions are, and so on. However, essentially none of the information about
    the contents of scenes is available during learning. This makes unsupervised methods
    essential, and allows them to be used as computational models for synaptic adaptation.

- en: In unsupervised learning, the machine receives inputs but obtains neither supervised
    target outputs, nor rewards from its environment. It may seem somewhat mysterious
    to imagine what the machine could possibly learn given that it doesn't get any
    feedback from its environment. However, it is possible to develop a formal framework
    for unsupervised learning, based on the notion that the machine's goal is to build
    representations of the input that can be used for decision making, predicting
    future inputs, efficiently communicating the inputs to another machine, and so
    on. In a sense, unsupervised learning can be thought of as finding patterns in
    the data above and beyond what would be considered noise.

- en: Structured prediction is an important area of application for machine learning
    problems in a variety of domains. Considering an input *x* and an output *y* in
    areas such as a labeling of time steps, a collection of attributes for an image,
    a parsing of a sentence, or a segmentation of an image into objects, problems
    are challenging because the *y*'s are exponential in the number of output variables
    that comprise it. These are computationally challenging because prediction requires
    searching an enormous space, and also statistical considerations, since learning
    accurate models from limited data requires reasoning about commonalities between
    distinct structured outputs. Structured prediction is fundamentally a problem
    of representation, where the representation must capture both the discriminative
    interactions between *x* and *y* and also allow for efficient combinatorial optimization
    over *y*.
