    within the FAA Wildlife Strike data to be tested with Power BI ML to see whether
    they are good predictive features, built out queries in Power Query to structure
    those features into tables, and completed the foundation of your high-level data
    architecture. You are ready to take a deep dive into analytics and prep for ML
    in Power BI.

    as you explore data and discover trends. You will also try a few of the Power
    BI AI visuals to see if you can uncover additional features that could be added
    to your machine learning efforts. At the end of this chapter, you will have a
    more complete analytical report and more robust data to build, train, and test
    your Power BI ML models.

    and Predict Height, you can add additional features to evaluate in each of the
    queries that will be used for Power BI ML. Features to evaluate the ML models
    will be added to each ML query. Building the ML models in Power BI will allow
    you to narrow down the list of features to those that are most useful. In order
    to make the chapter easy to read, you can take a look at potential new features
    one by one as they pertain to the three queries for Power BI ML. When training
    and testing your ML models in Power BI, the predictive value of each feature will
    be evaluated when you build the ML models. Therefore, if a feature is in question,
    you’re better off keeping it in the query and then removing it later on if it
    turns out to provide little value.
