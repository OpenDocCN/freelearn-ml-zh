			<p>Applied <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) and <strong class="bold">high-performance computing</strong> (<strong class="bold">HPC</strong>) have been integral to tackling the world’s most complex problems, including genomics, autonomous vehicles, computational fluid dynamics, and numerical optimization. Due to the high computing power required for these applications, HPC was once only used by large organizations that could afford it. Now, it is available for use by everyone, from individual research groups to start-ups and big enterprises, using <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) <span class="No-Break">cloud technology.</span></p>
			<p>This book provides a complete step-by-step explanation of the essential concepts with practical examples. You will begin by exploring virtually unlimited infrastructure and fast networking for scalable HPC on AWS, including an overview of the relevant tools and technologies. You’ll learn how to develop large-scale ML applications using HPC on AWS, you will understand the various architectural components, and you’ll learn about performance optimization, with hands-on application to real-world use cases in <span class="No-Break">various domains.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to build and deploy your own large-scale ML applications using HPC on AWS, following the industry best practices and addressing the key pain points encountered in the application <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></p>

			<p><a href="B18493_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">High-Performance Computing Fundamentals</em>, introduces the concepts of HPC, highlighting the importance of HPC as it relates to real-world scenarios. We then talk about technological advancements in HPC and how you can use it to solve complex business problems with unlimited capacity, the most advanced computing capabilities, and the elasticity of the cloud, while still optimizing cost, to innovate faster and gain a competitive <span class="No-Break">business advantage.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Data Management and Transfer</em>, dives into data management and transfer. The first step to running HPC applications on the cloud is to move the required data to the cloud. Therefore, this chapter focuses on different aspects of data migration, including challenges and key pain points businesses might face, and how AWS data migration services can help resolve them, following the best practices and still maintaining data integrity, consistency <span class="No-Break">and security.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Compute and Networking</em>, explains how once you have the data in the cloud, you need to understand the compute options provided by AWS as well as their differences, in order to optimally select the right option based on your business requirements. Furthermore, to scale and secure your HPC applications, we then dive into the Networking section, to explain the concepts of private VPC, low latency networking, and optimizing the performance of <span class="No-Break">inter-instance communications.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Data Storage</em>, explains that before you can begin performing ML using HPC, it’s important to understand the storage options and storage costs for both the transient and permanent storage requirements. This chapter dives deep into the various storage services in the AWS ecosystem, to help you select the right tool for the <span class="No-Break">right job.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Data Analysis</em>, teaches you how to explore the data, collect metrics, perform data correlation, and process large amounts of data using AWS to ensure data quality before using it for training <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Distributed Training of Machine Learning Models</em>, shows you how to implement a large ML model using vast amounts of data by leveraging distributed data parallel and model <span class="No-Break">parallel concepts.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Machine Learning Models at Scale</em>, discusses model deployment and inference. We will start with what managed deployment means on AWS, then go on to discuss the right deployment options, followed by various inference options (batch, asynchronous, and real-time). We will then discuss the reliability and availability of model endpoints on AWS infrastructure and the blue/green deployment option for different versions of <span class="No-Break">the model.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Optimizing and Managing Machine Learning Models for Edge Deployment</em>, explores ML models on edge devices. We will start with an introduction to edge computing, followed by factors we need to consider for the optimization of machine learning models. You will also learn about architecture design for <span class="No-Break">edge deployment.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor175"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Performance Optimization for Real-Time Inference</em>, discusses some of the key performance metrics used for ML models, techniques to reduce the memory footprint of large models, choosing the right machine (instance type) to deploy the model, load testing, and performance tuning <span class="No-Break">of models.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor186"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Data Visualization</em>, covers Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, a tool that enables users working in the domains of data science, ML, and analytics to build insightful data visualizations without writing much code. In addition, we will also briefly touch upon the topic of AWS’s graphics-optimized instances, since these instances can be used to create animated live data visualizations along with other high-performance computing applications such as game streaming, <span class="No-Break">and ML.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18493_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor197"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Computational Fluid Dynamics</em>, introduces the field of <strong class="bold">computational fluid dynamics</strong> (<strong class="bold">CFD</strong>), which uses numerical analysis to solve fluid flow problems. CFD has far-reaching applications in many industries such as the automotive industry, oil and gas, and manufacturing. We will discuss how CFD solvers can be used on AWS for massive-scale problems, and how recent advances in ML help with accelerating <span class="No-Break">CFD applications.</span></p>
