- en: As I welcome students and more seasoned researchers to the CERN IT Department,
    it is not unusual to hear this kind of comment about Elías’ lectures. I’ve been
    working at CERN for 25 years on R&D projects in computing and data science for
    high-energy physics and still I have not seen this happening that often with other
    courses.

- en: When I started building the CERN Quantum Technology Initiative in 2018, quantum
    computing and its applications had already started growing at an accelerated pace.
    We were looking for ways of understanding the potential benefits for physics and
    contributing to the ongoing research in theory, computing, sensing, and communication.
    A daunting task despite the incredible work that CERN has been doing since 1954
    in physics and computing for physics. Where to start? How to build knowledge?
    How to identify and address realistic problems? Which tools and techniques should
    we focus on?

    became a reference for the team, inspiring students and researchers and helping
    us lay solid foundations for the work we were doing with the LHC experiments and
    the theory groups at CERN. Samuel González-Castillo joined the team a year later
    during his summer internship, building from the ground up our first prototype
    of a quantum systems benchmark framework.

    guide you across complex concepts with rare clarity, building solid foundations
    to work comfortably with quantum optimization methods, quantum machine learning,
    and hybrid architectures without ever losing sight of the goal of providing a
    realistic, practical, usable approach.

- en: Chapters 1 and 2 will introduce you to the basics of quantum computing, building
    a reference of mathematical concepts and notations and a first practical overview
    of the ”tools of the trade,” the frameworks and platforms used to interact with
    quantum devices. Once the foundations are set like a sort of teaser of what’s
    to come, the rest of the book guides you through two complementary paths, quantum
    optimization methods in Chapters 3 to 7, and quantum machine learning, quantum
    neural networks, and hybrid architectures in Chapters 8 to 12.

- en: The authors not only provide clear formal explanations at every step, but also
    practical instructions and examples on how to implement and execute algorithms
    and methods on freely accessible actual quantum computers. Exercises (with detailed
    answers) are given throughout the book to check the progress of the exploration
    and gently nudge you beyond your comfort zone, always keeping the interest alive.

- en: Whether you are at the beginning of your discovery of quantum computing or are
    looking to understand its potential in your ongoing research, this book will be
    a trustworthy guide on an exciting journey. And I’m sure that the next time I
    meet you, you will say *“I know you, you wrote the foreword for Elias’ and* *Samuel’s
    book. That book changed my life!”*
