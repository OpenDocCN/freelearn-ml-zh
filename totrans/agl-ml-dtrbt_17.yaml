- en: In the preceding chapters, we learned to build and deploy models with DataRobot.
    We learned the basics, along with some advanced data science concepts. The disciplines
    of ML and data science continue to evolve rapidly. In response, tools such as
    DataRobot are also enhancing their capabilities. While these tools will continue
    to advance and make data scientists more productive, it is also expected that
    the role of good data scientists will become increasingly important and better
    understood. I hope we have convinced you that data scientists are not about to
    become obsolete and also that these tools have a lot to offer for data scientists,
    regardless of their level of expertise. It is also true that the methods and tools
    that we have right now are still very limited when it comes to intelligence. There
    is a lot of learning and uncovering to be done before the systems we build can
    be called intelligent.

    and AutoML tools that you can find and explore online. Let's now discuss where
    ML seems to be headed.

- en: It has been over 5 years since automated ML tools started appearing in the data
    science community. There are now several open source tools (for example, TPOT
    and Auto-WEKA) as well as proprietary tools (for example, Kortical and H2O) on
    the market. All major cloud providers now have some AutoML offering. Interest
    in these tools has been rising. It is safe to say that interest in these tools
    will keep rising and more offerings should be expected to come onto the market.
    We expect the tools to keep expanding the scope of tasks that will be automated
    to cover more aspects of the model development process. We can already see tools
    such as DataRobot offering more functions through internal development as well
    as through acquisitions such as Paxata. While it remains true that these tools
    do not support all use cases or types of modeling, they do cover a large number
    of use cases in a typical organization. More capabilities and algorithms are being
    added every quarter. We also expect that some niche vendors will emerge that focus
    on specific problems or methods such as reinforcement learning.

- en: Many of the ideas and methods described in this book can be used with other
    AutoML tools or even with just a notebook environment with open source Python
    libraries. The AutoML tools essentially serve to automate many of the mundane
    and labor-intensive tasks. Even with these developments, we expect that not all
    aspects of the model development process can be automated. We covered many of
    these aspects in different chapters of this book. Hence, it is our belief that
    trained and experienced data scientists will always be needed. Adoption of these
    tools will enable the data scientists to cover more use cases and the resulting
    models will be of higher quality. These tools will also expand the reach of advanced
    algorithms to analysts in organizations who understand data science concepts but
    are not as familiar or comfortable with programming. Like any tool or technology,
    there is the possibility of misuse. Data-savvy organizations will put model governance
    and training programs in place to prevent problems relating to the use of bad
    or biased data, solving the wrong problem, or creating solutions that are not
    actionable. Also, the organizations should look into their specific needs and
    then select the tools most appropriate for their situation.

- en: It is also expected that ML will need to move beyond pattern matching and we
    expect a bigger focus on causal modeling in the coming years. This is because
    many industrial use cases require specific decisions to be made or interventions
    that require decision makers to understand causal impacts and the consequences
    of these decisions. We have discussed some of these topics and methods. These
    methods defy automation in their current form and require substantial human input.
    For these methods to become mainstream, aspects of these methods need to be automated
    to enable organizations to start adopting them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the tools expand to include causal modeling, it will become imperative that
    capabilities be added to build models at a systemic level or be able to compose
    models to create a broader view of the systems under consideration. We will see
    the emergence of "digital twin" models that will represent entire systems. It
    will also be necessary to manage and control the configuration of many experiments
    that will need to be conducted. Given that large datasets are involved in building
    single models, current methods for running multiple experiments on multiple models
    are not scalable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also expect more data scientists to adopt the AutoML tools as they start
    realizing that these tools will make them more productive, while still giving
    them all the flexibility they need. This is done by combining programming languages,
    APIs, and automation support.

- en: Another trend to watch is tool vendors' focus on solving customers' problems.
    It is very common for some vendors to lose customer focus as they grow bigger,
    which ultimately can lead to their downfall. This is not a new phenomenon; it
    has been happening to tool vendors for a long time. We have seen many vendors
    lose this focus and fade into oblivion. Some of this will also happen to AutoML
    vendors, so be on the lookout for vendors who are not very responsive to your
    needs.

    player, but there are many others (H20, Kortical, and Google Cloud AutoML, to
    name a few) that are catching up rapidly. Many of the large cloud players are
    jumping into this space and have offerings that are very attractively priced.
    DataRobot continues to offer additional capabilities combined with good support
    from experienced data scientists. To that end, we expect that the DataRobot API
    will continue to evolve and become more robust to allow experienced data scientists
    to use DataRobot in a highly flexible and automated way.

- en: We have noticed new capabilities being released even as this book is being written,
    such as the recent acquisition of the Zepl notebook platform. In addition to that,
    DataRobot continues to acquire other companies to round out its offerings. Recently,
    a lot of focus has been on MLOps and enabling the rapid deployment of models.
    As the features and capabilities increase, the learning curve for understanding
    and using DataRobot also increases. It is our experience that many data scientists
    who use DataRobot are not fully aware of its capabilities and are not utilizing
    it to its fullest extent. We hope that books such as this will help with this
    issue. This alone, however, will not be enough to maintain a competitive position.
    Expanding into next-generation capabilities outlined in the previous section will
    be necessary to maintain an edge.

    put DataRobot to practical use in your organization right away and make your data
    science journey more productive. Hopefully, we have convinced you that a data
    scientist's role is not just to produce predictions, but to help enable good decisions.
    Just as a lot of what we do automates the tasks of many roles in the organization,
    it is also imperative that we do not fear the automation of data science tasks.
    We hope that this book provides useful ideas to a broad range of data scientists
    across a broad range of industries.
