If you are already an R wizard, you can skim through these sections and dive right into the next part which talks about what machine learning actually represents as a domain and the main areas it encompasses. We will also talk about different machine learning techniques and algorithms used in each area. Finally, we will conclude by looking at some of the most popular machine learning packages in R, some of which we will be using in the subsequent chapters.</p><p class="calibre8">If you are a data or machine learning enthusiast, surely you would have heard by now that being a data scientist is referred to as the sexiest job of the 21<sup class="calibre15">st</sup> century by Harvard Business Review.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note02" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre8">Reference: <a class="calibre1" href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/">https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/</a></p></div><p class="calibre8">There is a huge demand in the current market for data scientists, primarily because their main job is to gather crucial insights and information from both unstructured and structured data to help their business and organization grow strategically.</p><p class="calibre8">Some of you might be wondering how machine learning or R relate to all this! Well, to be a successful data scientist, one of the major tools you need in your toolbox is a powerful language capable of performing complex statistical calculations and working with various types of data and building models which help you get previously unknown insights and R is the perfect language for that! Machine learning forms the foundation of the skills you need to build to become a data analyst or data scientist, this includes using various techniques to build models to get insights from data.</p><p class="calibre8">This book will provide you with some of the essential tools you need to be well versed with both R and machine learning by not only looking at concepts but also applying those concepts in real-world examples. Enough talk; now let's get started on our journey into the world of machine learning with R!</p><p class="calibre8">In this chapter, we will cover the following aspects:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Delving into the basics of R</li><li class="listitem">Understanding the data structures in R</li><li class="listitem">Working with functions</li><li class="listitem">Controlling code flow</li><li class="listitem">Taking further steps with R</li><li class="listitem">Understanding machine learning basics</li><li class="listitem">Familiarizing yourself with popular machine learning packages in R</li></ul></div></div>

Hence, we won't be talking much about downloading and installations. There are plenty of resources on the web which provide a lot of information on this. I <a id="id1" class="calibre1"/>recommend that you use RStudio which is an <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">Integrated Development Environment</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">IDE</strong></span>), which is much better than the base R <a id="id2" class="calibre1"/>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">Graphical User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">GUI</strong></span>). You can visit <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a> to get more information about it.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note03" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre8">For details about the R project, you can visit <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a> to get an overview of the language. Besides this, R has a vast arsenal of wonderful packages at its disposal and you can view everything related to R and its packages at <a class="calibre1" href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a> which contains all the archives.</p></div><p class="calibre8">You must already be familiar with the R interactive interpreter, often called a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">Read-Evaluate-Print </strong></span><a id="id3" class="calibre1"/>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">Loop</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">REPL</strong></span>). This interpreter acts like any command line interface which asks for input and starts with a <code class="email">&gt;</code> character, which indicates that R is waiting for your input. If your input spans multiple lines, like when you are writing a function, you will see a <code class="email">+</code> prompt in each subsequent line, which means that you didn't finish typing the complete expression and R is asking you to provide the rest of the expression.</p><p class="calibre8">It is also possible for R to read and execute complete files containing commands and functions which are saved in files with an <code class="email">.R</code> extension. Usually, any big application consists of several <code class="email">.R</code> files. Each file has its own role in the application and is often called as a module. We will be exploring some of the main features and capabilities of R in the following sections.</p></div></div>

Basically, anything in R is a vector, even if it is a single number just like we saw in the earlier example! A vector is basically a sequence or a set of values. We can create vectors using the <code class="email">:</code> operator or the <code class="email">c</code> function which concatenates the values to create a vector.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

If you look closely, R threw a warning also.
