    and enhancement goals that have key performance metrics tied to them. These key
    performance metrics or measures are often termed the **key performance indicators**
    (**KPIs**) that help you track the performance of your marketing campaigns and
    define the success criteria of your marketing efforts. Some of the frequently
    used KPIs in digital and data-driven marketing that we will define and explore
    in this chapter are **conversion rate, cost per acquisition** (**CPA**), **customer
    lifetime value** (**CLV**), and **return on investment** (**ROI**).

    they tell you about your marketing campaigns, and how they can be used to further
    improve and optimize your marketing strategies and business outcomes. We will
    use an insurance product marketing dataset as an example to highlight how Python
    and its data analysis and visualization libraries, such as `pandas, numpy, matplotlib,`
    and `plotly`, can be used for analyzing, visualizing, and generating insights

    successes and failures of any marketing efforts. The proper usage and definition
    of KPIs ahead of embarking on any marketing campaign is crucial for the effective
    measurement of marketing successes and failures. However, improper usage of KPIs
    can result in misinformation being gathered and often wasting significant financial
    and human resources that have a direct negative impact on the business.

    Instagram vs. TikTok, or influencer referrals vs. paid ads), it may tell a completely

    product feature deficiencies, or market shifts in interests. On top of tracking
    this KPI, delving deeper into the drivers behind the rise and fall of conversion
    rates is even more important. We will look further into this in the following

    providing continuous value to the customers, and making them stick to your services
    or products. Retaining customers and turning them into consistent repeat customers
    are directly tied to generating steady revenue streams. Some of the key metrics
    to track are **customer retention rate** (**CRR**), **customer churn rate** (**CCR**),
    **customer lifetime value** (**CLV**), and **cost per acquisition** (**CPA**).

    continuously; on the other hand, an increase in CCR suggests the opposite. There

    the potential causes is the key to building successful marketing strategies during
    this stage. We will discuss how to look at data from different angles to have

    so that you can continuously monitor and gauge the loyal customer groupâ€™s interest
    level. The number of clicks and likes, which were the KPIs during the *Engagement*
    stage, for example, are still relevant in the *Loyalty* stage so that you can
    track the continuous engagement of this group of customers. The number and amount
    of purchases, as well as the retention and churn rates that were some of the KPIs

    have from your services and products. It would be wise to periodically conduct
    such satisfaction surveys and monitor NPS, as not addressing decreasing NPS is
    likely to result in increasing customer churn rate and lower conversion rates.

    revenue with less spending. The most straightforward approach in tracking and
    measuring this is to look at conversion rate, CLV, and CPA. The conversion rate
    tells us the percentage of leads converted into paying customers, CLV tells us
    the estimated revenue being generated per acquired customer, and CPA tells us
    how much it costs to acquire a paying customer. By combining these three KPIs,
    we can understand the ROI and contribution to the net income.

    of area further affect the CLVs. Previously, we have seen that *Arizona* has the
    lowest overall CLV compared to other states; however, as this bar plot shows,
    the urban area of `Arizona` has the highest CLV and the decrease in the CLV was
    mostly driven by the `Rural` and `Suburban` areas within `Arizona`. Generally
    speaking, CLVs in urban areas are higher than in rural and suburban areas, except
    for *Oregon* and *Washington*. Rural areas within the `Oregon` and `Washington`
    states have higher CLVs than those of urban areas. As can be noted from this exercise,
    analyzing KPIs from different angles exposes different insights.
