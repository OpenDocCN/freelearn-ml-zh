- en: Over the last decade, two automation trends have transformed the way that companies
    operate. The first trend is the use of **Robotic Process Automation** (**RPA**)
    technology to automate back-office computer tasks. The second trend, currently
    in progress, aims to automate work that was previously considered immune to automation.
    This is **Intelligent Automation** (**IA**), which combines RPA with **Machine
    Learning** (**ML**) to automate worker intelligence and complex decision-making.

- en: The term IA means different things depending on where it’s used. For some, IA
    means incorporating AI features into RPA products to simplify the development
    of automation, or adding self-healing to help the digital workers recover from
    errors. In this book, IA means the *use of ML with RPA to replace human cognitive
    work during the execution of an automated process*. While there’s value in helping
    developers work more effectively, IA should be primarily defined by its ability
    to transform operations and drive business benefits through the use of ML at a
    massive scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are already a few IA books out there. They’re mostly focused on selling
    the high-level vision and benefits of IA. However, with the incredible boom of
    ML, most companies are already buying into the idea of IA and allocating budgets
    to ML. This signals that we need to start moving away from the **why** of IA onto
    the **how**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book intends to bridge that gap and show readers how to put IA into practice
    through hands-on examples with **Blue Prism** (**BP**), a pioneering software
    firm in the RPA and IA space. Many technology books are pieced together by combining
    existing sources, such as online articles and courses. This book is different;
    it’s an extension of my thesis research at MIT about IA and how to manage its
    risks. I’ve combined this research with my own BP expertise to write a practitioner-focused
    IA book with content that, to my knowledge, doesn’t exist anywhere else.

- en: For companies, IA won’t just be a “nice-to-have.” The ability to operationalize
    ML predictions in everyday work will likely become a *condition of survival* for
    most firms in the future. People with a nuanced, as opposed to a high-level, understanding
    of IA will be able to differentiate themselves in the marketplace. This book will
    provide you with this nuanced understanding of IA and guide you and your company
    toward better IA outcomes.

- en: However, there’s some basic ML terminology that will be used throughout this
    book. First, we have **regression** versus **classification**. These two terms
    broadly separate the type of ML prediction that we’re trying to make. For *regression*
    problems, we’re looking to predict a numerical value, for instance, forecasting
    sales numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For *classification* problems, we’re looking to categorize something. The different
    categories that we’re trying to predict are called **labels**. For example, we
    might be trying to separate customer support tickets into different categories:
    *Complaint*, *Refund*, and *Sales Enquiry*. These three are the *labels* of our
    *classification* problem.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **confidence score** is a number that is returned with almost every ML prediction,
    and it represents how confident the service is of that prediction. This interval
    will range between 0 and 1, or 0 to 100\. For example, if you send in a photo
    of an animal into an ML model, it may reply that the *label* “cat” has 0.96 *confidence*,
    and that the *label* “tiger” has 0.99 *confidence*.
