  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Julia is a new programming language offering a unique combination of performance
    and productivity that promises to change scientific computing, and programming
    in general.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Julia picks the best parts of existing programming languages, providing out-of-the-box
    features such as a powerful REPL, an expressive syntax, Lisp-style metaprogramming
    capabilities, powerful numeric and scientific programming libraries, a built-in
    package manager, efficient Unicode support, and easily called C and Python functions.

- en: It has C-like execution speed with excellent applications in multi-core, GPU,
    and cloud-based computing. *Julia Programming Projects* explains all this with
    the support of Julia v1.0.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After six years in development as an open source project, Julia is now ready
    to take the stage with the release of v1.0.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists, statisticians, business analysts, and developers who are interested
    in learning how to use Julia to crunch numbers, analyze data, and build apps will
    find this book useful. A basic knowledge of programming is assumed.

- en: '[Chapter 1](90a7f09d-d63b-45d7-baf5-576470d0910f.xhtml), *Getting Started with Julia Programming*, introduces
    you to the Julia language, covering what it is and what its strengths are. Then,
    the chapter guides you through setting up a working Julia environment, looking
    at the various options for running Julia, locally and online. We''ll cover installation,
    REPL, and IDE options, as well as the basics for extending the language through
    the integrated package manager.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](b9056286-1d26-4cb4-bf90-bdc76722b3fb.xhtml), *Creating Our First
    Julia App*, will show you how to perform data analysis against the Iris dataset
    with Julia. We take a look at RDatasets, a package that provides access to 700
    learning datasets distributed with the R language. We''ll load the Iris dataset
    and we''ll manipulate it using standard data analysis functions. We also look
    more closely at the data by employing common visualization techniques using Gadfly.
    In the process, we cover strings and regular expressions, numbers, tuples, ranges,
    and arrays. Finally, we''ll see how to persist and (re)load our data with CSV,
    Feather, and MongoDB.'

    Game*, introduces our first fully featured Julia project, a Wikipedia web crawler
    disguised as a popular game. In the first iteration, we will build a program that
    gets a random web page from Wikipedia. Then we''ll learn about parsing the HTML
    response using CSS selectors. We''ll use this to introduce key concepts such as
    functions, pairs, dictionaries, exceptions, and conditional evaluation.'

    Game Web Crawler*, will build upon the foundations set in the previous chapter,
    and we''ll build a Wikipedia web scraper that implements the requirements of the
    wiki game.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](13ffe39c-8304-4c05-8ed9-5a173859f5ad.xhtml), *Adding a Web UI for
    the Wiki Game*, will see us finish the Wiki Game by adding a web UI. We''ll build
    a simple web app that will allow the player to start a new game, render the Wikipedia
    articles picked by the game engine, and navigate between linked Wikipedia articles.
    The UI will also keep track of and display current game progress and determine
    a session as a win or a loss.'

    Systems with Julia*, will have you take on a more challenging example project
    and build a few basic recommender systems. We''ll set up a supervised machine
    learning system powered by Julia and we will develop some simple movie recommenders.'

    for Recommender Systems*, will show you how to implement a more powerful recommender
    system using the `Recommender.jl` package. We will use a sample dataset to train
    our system and generate book recommendations as we''ll learn about model-based
    recommenders.'

    Learning Techniques*, will teach you how to perform unsupervised machine learning,
    namely clustering, using Julia. We will practice by using the San Francisco businesses
    registry. We''ll use the powerful `DataFrames` package in combination with `Query.jl`
    to slice and dice the dataset, and we''ll get more insight using visualizations.
    In the process, we will learn about metaprogramming and `Clustering.jl`.'

    series. Here we introduce you to the basics of working with dates, time zones,
    and time series. We''ll use the `TimeSeries.jl` package and `Plots.jl` to analyze
    time series data, and we''ll learn about the `TimeArray` data structure.'

    We''ll discuss more advanced package management features, unit testing, benchmarking,
    and performance tips, adding and generating documentation for Julia software,
