- en: The new vSphere Scale-Out edition is specifically designed for running **high-performance
    computing** (**HPC**) and big data workloads. We have to ensure that HPC and big
    data performance and other requirements can be met either by development or by
    fine-tuning guidelines with our mainstream products. This vSphere edition comes
    with a feature set that has been adjusted to align with these two Scale-Out workload
    types, HPC and big data, and at a competitive cost. It packages all the core vSphere
    features required for big data and HPC workloads and is sold in packs of 8 CPUs.
    Key features included in the vSphere Scale-Out edition include ESXi hypervisor,
    vMotion, Storage vMotion, Host Profiles, Auto Deploy, and Distributed Switch.
