<p class="mce-root">In this book, you learn how to leverage the power of Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to solve problems in computer vision. Python is the ideal programming language for rapidly prototyping and developing production-grade code for image processing and computer vision, with its robust syntax and wealth of powerful libraries.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book will be your practical guide to designing and developing production-grade computer vision projects that tackle real-world problems. You will learn how to set up Anaconda Python for the major OSes with cutting-edge third-party libraries for computer vision, and you will learn state-of-the-art techniques of classifying images and finding and identifying humans within videos. You will gain the expertise <span>required </span>to build your own computer vision projects using Python and its associated libraries by the end of this book.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The </span><kbd>word_counts.txt</kbd><span> file contains a vocabulary list with the number of counts from our trained model, which our image caption generator is going to need.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>testfile = 'test_images/dog.jpeg'<br/><br/>figure()<br/>imshow(imread(testfile))</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>conda install -c menpo dlib</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong><span>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w</span><span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Click the <span class="packt_screen">Download</span> button.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
