    human-like text. As you learned in [*Chapter 10*](B22207_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187),
    *Identify Features of Generative AI Solutions*, these models are trained on vast
    datasets consisting of words or sequences of characters, referred to as tokens.
  id: totrans-149
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, a complex word such as *juggernaut* might be segmented into smaller
    tokens such as *jug*, *ger*, and *naut* for more granular analysis, whereas a
    simpler and more common word such as *train* may be treated as a single token.
    Each token is then converted into a numerical vector, a process that transforms
    the textual information into a format that the ML model can efficiently process
    and learn from.
  id: totrans-150
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This vectorization of tokens allows the model to discern patterns, relationships,
    and contexts within the language, facilitating a deep understanding of linguistic
    structures. When interacting with user input, the model similarly decomposes the
    text into tokens, applying its learned patterns to interpret the input or generate
    responses. This tokenization process is a critical step in enabling the model
    to handle a wide array of NL tasks, from text completion and translation to content
    generation and sentiment analysis, making it a cornerstone of OpenAI’s approach
    to NLU and NLG.
