			<h2 id="_idParaDest-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"/>About the Book</h2>
			<p>Starting with the basics, <em class="italics">Applied Unsupervised Learning with R</em> explains clustering methods, distribution analysis, data encoders, and features of R that enable you to understand your data better and get answers to your most pressing business questions.</p>
			<p>This book begins with the most important and commonly used method for unsupervised learning – clustering – and explains the three main clustering algorithms: k-means, divisive, and agglomerative. Following this, you'll study market basket analysis, kernel density estimation, principal component analysis, and anomaly detection. You'll be introduced to these methods using code written in R, with further instructions on how to work with, edit, and improve R code. To help you gain a practical understanding, the book also features useful tips on applying these methods to real business problems, including market segmentation and fraud detection. By working through interesting activities, you'll explore data encoders and latent variable models.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have a better understanding of different anomaly detection methods, such as outlier detection, Mahalanobis distances, and contextual and collective anomaly detection.</p>

			<p>Each great journey begins with a humble step. Our upcoming adventure in the land of data wrangling is no exception. Before we can do awesome things with data, we need to be prepared with the most productive environment. In this small note, we shall see how to do that.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Installing R on Windows</h3>
			<p>To install R on Windows, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the page dedicated to the latest version of R for Windows: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/</a>.</li>
				<li>Click the link that says "<strong class="bold">Download R X.X.X for Windows</strong>", where each X is a natural number, for example R 3.5.3. This will initiate a file download.</li>
				<li>The file you downloaded in <em class="italics">Step 1</em> is an <strong class="inline">exe</strong> file. Double-click on this file, and a program will run that will install R on your computer.</li>
				<li>The installation program that you ran in <em class="italics">Step 3</em> will prompt you with some questions about how you want to install R. Choose the default options for each of these prompts. </li>
				<li>You can open R by double-clicking on its icon wherever it was installed on your Windows computer during <em class="italics">Step 4</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Installing R on macOS X</h3>
			<p>To install R on macOS X, perform the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the following link, which is dedicated to the latest version of R for macOS X: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/</a>.</li>
				<li>Under the <strong class="bold">Latest release</strong> heading, click on a file called <strong class="bold">R-X.X.X.pkg</strong>, where each X stands for a natural number, for example, <strong class="bold">R-3.5.2.pkg</strong>. </li>
				<li>Open the file that you downloaded in <em class="italics">Step 2</em>. This will be a .<strong class="inline">pkg</strong> file. When you open this file, OS X will open installation wizards that will guide you through the rest of the process.</li>
				<li>When the installation wizards ask you to make a decision about the installation, choose the default option.</li>
				<li>After the installation wizards have completed their work, you will be able to double-click on R's icon wherever it was installed. This will open an R console.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Installing R on Linux</h3>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Determine which package manager your version of Linux uses. Two common examples of package managers are <strong class="inline">yum</strong> and <strong class="inline">apt</strong>. </li>
				<li>Open the Terminal and type the following two commands using your package manager:<p class="snippet">sudo apt update</p><p class="snippet">sudo apt install r-base</p><p>In this case, we wrote <strong class="inline">apt</strong> as the package manager, but if your version of Linux uses <strong class="inline">yum</strong> or some other package manager, you should replace every <strong class="inline">apt</strong> in these two lines with <strong class="inline">yum</strong> or the name of your package manager.</p></li>
				<li>If you encounter problems, it could be that your version of Linux is not accessing the correct repository. To tell Linux where the right repository is, you should open the <strong class="inline">sources.list</strong> file for your version of Linux. For Ubuntu, this file is stored by default at <strong class="inline">/etc/apt/sources.list</strong>. </li>
				<li>In the <strong class="inline">sources.list</strong> file, you need to add one of the following two lines if you are using either Debian or Ubuntu. For Ubuntu versions, use the following: http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu/. For Debian versions, use the following: <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian/"><strong class="inline">deb</strong> http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian/</a>. If you are using <a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Red Hat, you can run the following line in the Terminal to tell Linux which repository to use to download R: <strong class="inline">sudo yum install epel-release</strong>.</li>
