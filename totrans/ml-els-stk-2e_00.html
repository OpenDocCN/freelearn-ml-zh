			<p>Elastic Stack, previously known as the ELK Stack, is a log analysis solution that helps users ingest, process, and analyze search data effectively. With the addition of machine learning, a key commercial feature, the Elastic Stack makes this process even more efficient. This updated second edition of <em class="italic">Machine Learning with the Elastic Stack</em> provides a comprehensive overview of Elastic Stack's machine learning features for both time series data analysis as well as classification, regression, and outlier detection.</p>
			<p>The book starts by explaining machine learning concepts in an intuitive way. You'll then perform time series analysis on different types of data, such as log files, network flows, application metrics, and financial data. As you progress through the chapters, you'll deploy machine learning within the Elastic Stack for logging, security, and metrics. Finally, you'll discover how data frame analysis opens up a whole new set of use cases that machine learning can help you with.</p>
			<p>By the end of this Elastic Stack book, you'll have hands-on machine learning and Elastic Stack experience, along with the knowledge you need to incorporate machine learning into your distributed search and data analysis platform.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you're a data professional looking to gain insights into Elasticsearch data without having to rely on a machine learning specialist or custom development, then this Elastic Stack machine learning book is for you. You'll also find this book useful if you want to integrate machine learning with your observability, security, and analytics applications. Working knowledge of the Elastic Stack is needed to get the most out of this book.	</p>
