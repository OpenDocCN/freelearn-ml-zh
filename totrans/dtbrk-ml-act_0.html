			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>In this book, you will discover what makes <a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform the go-to choice for top-tier machine learning solutions. <em class="italic">Databricks ML in Action</em> presents cloud-agnostic, end-to-end examples with hands-on illustrations of executing data science, machine learning, and generative AI projects on the Databricks Platform. You’ll develop expertise in Databricks’ managed MLflow, Vector Search, AutoML, Unity Catalog, and Model Serving as you learn to apply them practically in everyday workflows. This Databricks book not only offers detailed code explanations but also facilitates seamless code importation for practical use. You’ll discover how to leverage the open source Databricks platform to enhance your learning, boost your skills, and elevate your productivity with <span class="No-Break">supplemental resources.</span>
By the end of this book, you’ll have mastered the use of Databricks for data science, machine learning, and generative AI, enabling you to deliver outstanding <span class="No-Break">data products.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and technical managers seeking hands-on expertise in implementing and leveraging the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform and its lakehouse architecture to create <span class="No-Break">data products.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B16865_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with This Book and Lakehouse Concepts</em>, covers the different techniques and methods for data engineering and machine learning. The goal is not to unveil insights into data never seen before. If that were the case, this would be an academic paper. Instead, the goal of this chapter is to use open and free data to demonstrate advanced technology and best practices. You will list and describe each dataset present in <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Designing Databricks: Day One</em>, covers workspace design, model life cycle practices, naming conventions, what not to put in DBFS, and other preparatory topics. The Databricks platform is simple to use. However, there are many options available to cater to the different needs of different organizations. During my years as a contractor and my time at Databricks, I have seen teams succeed and fail. I will share with you the successful dynamics as well as any configurations that accompany those insights in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Building Out Our Bronze Layer</em>, begins your data journey in the Databricks DI Platform by exploring the fundamentals of the Bronze layer of the Medallion architecture. The Bronze layer is the first step in transforming your data for downstream projects, and this chapter will focus on the Databricks features and techniques you have available for the necessary transformations. We will start by introducing you to Auto Loader, a tool to automate data ingestion, which you can implement with or without <strong class="bold">Delta Live Tables</strong> (<strong class="bold">DLT</strong>) to insert and transform <span class="No-Break">your data.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor180"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know Your Data</em>, explores the features within the Databricks DI Platform that help improve and monitor data quality and facilitate data exploration. There are numerous approaches to getting to know your data better with Databricks. First, we cover how to oversee data quality with DLT to catch quality issues early and prevent the contamination of entire pipelines. We will take our first close look at Lakehouse Monitoring, which helps us analyze data changes over time and can alert us to changes that <span class="No-Break">concern us.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor244"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Feature Engineering on Databricks</em>, progresses from <a href="B16865_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor180"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, where we harnessed the power of Databricks to explore and refine our datasets, to delve into the components of Databricks that enable the next step – feature engineering. We will start by covering <strong class="bold">Databricks Feature Engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">DFE</strong>) in Unity Catalog to show you how you can efficiently manage engineered features using Unity Catalog. Understanding how to leverage DFE in UC is crucial for creating reusable and consistent features across training and inference. Then, you will learn how to leverage Structured Streaming to calculate features on a stream, which allows you to create stateful features needed for models to make <span class="No-Break">quick decisions.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor297"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Searching for a Signal</em>, examines how to use data science to search for a signal hidden in the noise of data. We will leverage the features we created within the Databricks platform during the previous chapter. We will start by using AutoML in a basic modeling approach, providing auto-generated code and quickly enabling data scientists to establish a baseline model to beat. When searching for a signal, we experiment with different features, hyperparameters, and models. Historically, tracking these configurations and their corresponding evaluation metrics is a time-consuming project in and of itself. A low-overhead tracking mechanism, such as the tracking provided by MLflow, an open source platform for managing data science projects and supporting MLOps, will reduce the burden of manually capturing configurations. More specifically, we’ll introduce MLflow Tracking, an MLflow component that significantly improves tracking each permutation’s many outputs. However, that is only <span class="No-Break">the beginning.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor325"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Productionizing ML on Databricks</em>, explores productionizing a machine learning model using Databricks products, which makes the journey more straightforward and cohesive by incorporating functionality such as the Unity Catalog Registry, Databricks Workflows, Databricks Asset Bundles, and Model Serving capabilities. This chapter will cover the tools and practices to take your models from development <span class="No-Break">to production.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B16865_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor384"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring, Evaluating, and More</em>, covers how to create visualizations for dashboards in both the new Lakeview dashboards and the standard DBSQL dashboards. Deployed models can be shared via a web application. Therefore, we will not only introduce Hugging Face Spaces but also deploy the RAG chatbot using a Gradio app to apply what we <span class="No-Break">have learned.</span></p>
