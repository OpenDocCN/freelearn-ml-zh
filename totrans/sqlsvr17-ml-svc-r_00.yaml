- en: SQL Server has supported machine learning capabilities since SQL Server 2016\.
    Previously known as SQL Server 2016 R Services, SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning
    Services come in two flavors, R and Python. This book provides hands-on reference
    and learning materials for data professionals, DBAs, and data scientists on how
    to install, develop, deploy, maintain, and administer data science and advanced
    analytical solutions using SQL Server with R. Whether you are new to SQL Server,
    or an experienced SQL Server professional, *Hands-on SQL Server Machine Learning
    Services with R* contains practical explanations, tips, and examples to enable
    you to make the most of keeping analytics close to the data for better efficiency
    and security.

    of Microsoft Machine Learning Server and SQL Server, *gives a brief outline and
    overview of Microsoft Machine Learning Server with an emphasis on SQL Server Machine
    Learning Services, while exploring how it works and the different versions of
    R environment. This includes key discussions on the architecture behind it, different
    computational environments, how the integration among systems work, and how to
    achieve parallelism and load distribution.'

    Machine Learning Services for SQL Server 2017 and R*, covers the installation
    and setup, including how to use PowerShell. It covers exploring the capabilities
    of a resource governor, setting up roles and security for users to work with SQL
    Server Machine Learning Services with R, working with sessions and logs, installing
    any missing or additional R packages for data analysis or predictive modeling,
    and taking the first steps with using the `sp_execute_external_script` external
    procedure.'

    and Data Visualization*, explores the R syntax for data browsing, analysis, munging,
    and wrangling for visualization and predictive analysis. Developing these techniques
    is essential to the next steps covered in this chapter and throughout this book.
    This chapter introduces various useful R packages for visualization and predictive
    modeling. In addition, readers will learn how to integrate R with Power BI, SQL
    Server Reporting Services (SSRS), and mobile reports.'

    statistical computation over large datasets. Using RevoScaleR improves CPU and
    RAM utilization and improves performance. This chapter introduces readers to RevoScaleR
    functions on data preparation, descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and

    modeling for the first time. Using SQL Server and SQL Server Machine Learning
    Services with R, readers will learn how to create predictions, perform data modeling,
    explore advanced predictive algorithms available in RevoScaleR and other packages,
    and how to easily deploy the models and solutions. Finally, calling and running
    predictions and exposing the results to different proprietary tools (such as Power
    BI, Excel, and SSRS) complete the world of prediction modeling.'

    Readers will learn the importance as stable and reliable process flows are essential
    to combining R code, persistent data, and prediction models in production. In
    this chapter, readers will have a chance to explore ways to adopt existing and
    create new R code, followed by integrating this in SQL Server through various
    readily available client tools such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and
    Visual Studio. Furthermore, this chapter covers how readers can use SQL Server
    Agent jobs, stored procedures, CLR with .NET, and PowerShell to productized R
    code.'

    manage deployment and change control to database deployment when integrating R
    code. This chapter provides guidelines on how to do an integrated deployment of
    the solution and how to implement continuous integration, including automated
    deployment and how to manage the version control. Here, readers will learn efficient
    ways to monitor the solution, monitor the effectiveness of the code, and predictive
    models after the solution is deployed.'

    and troubleshooting for daily, weekly, and monthly tasks the DBAs are doing. Using
    simple examples showing that R Services can also be useful for other roles involved
    in SQL Server, this chapter shows how R Services integrated in SQL Server enables
    DBAs to be more empowered by evolving their rudimentary monitoring activities
    into more useful actionable predictions.'

    2016 and 2017 and R services can be used together, such as taking advantage of
    the new JSON format with the R language, using new improvements to the in-memory
    OLTP technology to deliver almost real-time analytics, combining new features
    in Column store index and R, and how to get the most out of them. It also considers
    how to leverage PolyBase and Stretch DB to reach beyond on-premises to hybrid
    and cloud possibilities. Lastly, the query store holds many statistics from execution
    plans, and R is a perfect tool to perform deeper analysis.'
