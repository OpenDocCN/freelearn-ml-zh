- en: In previous chapters, we learned about how to store data, carry out data processing,
    and perform model training for machine learning applications. After training a
    machine learning model and validating it using a test dataset, the next task is
    generally to perform inference on new and unseen data. It is important for any
    machine learning application that the trained model should generalize well for
    unseen data to avoid overfitting. In addition, for real-time applications, the
    model should be able to carry out inference with minimal latency while accessing
    all the relevant data (both new and stored) needed for the model to do inference.
    Also, the compute resources associated with the model should be able to scale
    up or down depending on the number of inference requests, in order to optimize
    cost while not sacrificing performance and inference requirements for real-time
    machine learning applications.

- en: For use cases that do not require real-time inference, the trained model should
    be able to carry out inference on very large datasets with thousands of variables
    in a reasonable amount of time as well. In addition, in several scenarios, we
    may not want to go through the effort of managing servers and software packages
    needed for inference, and instead, focus our effort on developing and improving
    our machine learning models.

    for deploying machine learning models to carry out inference on new and unseen
    data. These options consist of real-time inference, batch inference, and asynchronous
    inference. In this chapter, we are going to discuss the managed deployment options
    of machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker, along with various features
    such as high availability of models, auto-scaling, and blue/green deployments.

    learning models to solve business problems are often very focused on model development.
    Problem formulation and developing an elegant solution, choosing the right algorithm,
    and training the model so that it provides reliable and accurate results are the
    main components of the machine learning problem solving cycle that we want our
    data scientists and data engineers to focus on.

    on new data. Deploying the model and then managing it are tasks that often require
    dedicated engineers and computation resources. This is because, we first need
    to make sure that we have all the right packages and libraries for the model to
    work correctly. Then, we also need to decide on the type and amount of compute
    resources needed for the model to run. In real-time applications, we often end
    up designing for peak performance requirements, just like provisioning servers
    for IT projects.

- en: After the model is deployed and is running, we also need to make sure that everything
    stays working in the manner that we expect it to. Furthermore, in real world scenarios,
    data scientists often have to manually carry out analysis periodically to detect
    model or data drift. In the event that either of these drifts are detected, the
    data scientists go through the entire cycle of exploratory analysis, feature engineering,
    model development, model training, hyperparameter optimization, model evaluation,
    and model deployment again. All these tasks consume a lot of effort and resources
    and due to this reason, many organizations have moved to automating these processes
    using **machine learning operations** (**MLOps**) workflows and managed model
    deployment options that scale well with varying workloads.

    are multi-model endpoints, where multiple models can share a container. This helps
    with reducing hosting costs since endpoint utilization is increased due to multiple
    models sharing the same endpoint. In addition, it also enables time sharing of
    memory resources across different models. SageMaker also has the option of building
    and deploying multi-container endpoints. Furthermore, we can attach scaling policies
    to our endpoints to allocate more compute resources when traffic increases, and
    shut down instances when traffic decreases in order to save on costs.

    Edge Manager uses SageMaker Neo to compile machine learning models and packages
    these compiled models to be deployed on edge devices. In addition, we can also

    This processing job analyzes the data and creates statistics and constraints for
    the baseline data (generally the same dataset with which the model has been trained
    or validated on). We also need to enable data capture on our SageMaker endpoint
    to be able to capture the new data along with inference results. Another processing
    job is then run on fixed intervals to create new statistics and constraints, compares
    them with the baseline statistics and constraints, and then configures alarms
    using Amazon CloudWatch metrics in case there is drift in any of the metrics we

    is a very valuable tool for data scientists. It can cut down on tedious manual

    blue fleet to the green fleet. The blue (old) fleet is kept in service for a period
    of time (called the baking period) to make sure everything is working fine, and
    performance and functionality are as expected. After the baking period, the blue
    fleet is terminated all at once. This type of blue/green deployment minimizes
    the overall update duration, while also minimizing the cost. One disadvantage
    of the all-at-once method is that regressive updates affect all of the traffic
    since the entire traffic is shifted to the green fleet at once.

- en: In canary blue/green deployment, a small portion of the traffic is first shifted
    from the blue fleet to the green fleet. This portion of the green fleet that starts
    serving a portion of the traffic is called the canary, and it should be less than
    50% of the new fleet’s capacity. If everything works fine during the baking period
    and no CloudWatch alarms are triggered, the rest of the traffic is also shifted
    to the green fleet, after which the blue fleet is terminated. If any alarms go
    off during the baking period, SageMaker rolls back all the traffic to the blue
    fleet.

- en: An advantage of using canary blue/green deployment is that it confines the blast
    radius of regressive updates only to the canary fleet and not to the whole fleet,
    unlike all-at-once blue/green deployment. A disadvantage of using canary deployment
    is that both the blue and the green fleets are operational for the entire deployment
    period, thus adding to the cost.

- en: In linear blue/green deployment, traffic is shifted from the blue fleet to the
    green fleet in a fixed number of pre-specified steps. In the beginning, the first
    portion of traffic is shifted to the green fleet, and the same portion of the
    blue fleet is deactivated. If no alarms go off during the baking period, SageMaker
    initiates the shifting of the second portion, and so on. If at any point an alarm
    goes off, SageMaker rolls back all the traffic to the blue fleet. Since traffic
    is shifted over to the green fleet in several steps, linear blue/green deployment
    reduces the risk of regressive updates significantly. The cost of the linear deployment
    method is proportional to the number of steps configured to shift the traffic
    from the blue fleet to the green fleet.

    to make sure that there are safety guardrails when we are updating our endpoints.
    These blue/green deployment methods ensure that we are able to update our inference
    endpoints with no or minimal disruption to our deployed machine learning models
    in a production environment.

- en: In this chapter, we discussed the various managed deployment methods available
    when using Amazon SageMaker. We talked about the suitability of the different
    deployment/inference methods for different use case types. We showed examples
    of how we can do batch inference and deploy real-time and asynchronous endpoints.
    We also discussed how SageMaker can be configured to automatically scale both
    up and down, and how SageMaker ensures that in case of an outage, our endpoints
    are deployed to multiple availability zones. We also touched upon the various
    blue/green deployment methodologies available with Amazon SageMaker, in order
    to update our endpoints in production.

    instances available for carrying out inference on new and unseen data in real
    time. For such applications, we need to use edge computing devices. These devices
    often have limitations on compute power, memory, connectivity, and bandwidth,
    and need the models to be optimized to be able to use on these edge devices.

    learning models on edge devices.
