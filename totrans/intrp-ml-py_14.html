    <h1 id="_idParaDest-399" class="chapterTitle">What’s Next for Machine Learning Interpretability?</h1>
    <p class="normal">Over the last thirteen chapters, we have explored the field of <strong class="keyWord">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">ML</strong>) interpretability. As stated in the preface, it’s a broad area of research, most of which hasn’t even left the lab and become widely used yet, and this book has no intention of covering absolutely all of it. Instead, the objective is to present various interpretability tools in sufficient depth to be useful as a starting point for beginners and even complement the knowledge of more advanced readers. This chapter will summarize what we’ve learned in the context of the ecosystem of ML interpretability methods, and then speculate on what’s to come next!</p>
    <p class="normal">These are the main topics we are going to cover in this chapter:</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-400" class="heading-1">Understanding the current landscape of ML interpretability</h1>
    <p class="normal">First, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker1529"/>provide some context on how the book relates to the main goals of ML interpretability and how practitioners can start <a id="_idIndexMarker1530"/>applying the methods to achieve those broad goals. Then, we’ll discuss the current areas of growth in research.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-401" class="heading-2">Tying everything together!</h2>
    <p class="normal">As discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Interpretation, Interpretability, and Explainability; and Why Does It All Matter?</em>, there are three main themes when talking about ML interpretability: <strong class="keyWord">Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">FAT</strong>), and <a id="_idIndexMarker1531"/>each of these presents a series of concerns (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.1</em>). I think we can all agree these are all desirable properties for a model! Indeed, these concerns all present opportunities for the improvement of <strong class="keyWord">Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AI</strong>) systems. These improvements start by leveraging model interpretation methods to evaluate models, confirm or dispute assumptions, and find problems.</p>
    <p class="normal">What your aim <a id="_idIndexMarker1532"/>is will depend on what stage you are at in the ML workflow. If the model is already in production, the objective might be to evaluate it with a whole suite of metrics, but if the model is still in early development, the aim may be to find deeper problems that a metric won’t discover. Perhaps you are also just using black-box models for knowledge discovery as we did in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em> – in other words, leveraging the models to learn from the data with no plan to take it to production. If this is the case, you might confirm or dispute the assumptions you had about the data, and by extension, the model:</p>
    <p class="packt_figref"><img src="../Images/18406_14_01.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.1: ML interpretation methods</p>
    <p class="normal">In any case, none of<a id="_idIndexMarker1533"/> these aims are mutually exclusive, and you should probably always be looking for problems and disputing assumptions, even when the model appears to be performing well!</p>
    <p class="normal">And regardless of the aim and primary concern, it is recommended that you use many interpretation methods, not only because no technique is perfect but also because all problems and aims are interrelated. In other words, there’s no justice without consistency and no reliability without transparency. </p>
    <p class="normal">In fact, you can read <em class="italic">Figure 14.1</em> from bottom to top as if it were a pyramid, because transparency is foundational, followed by accountability in the second tier, and, ultimately, fairness is the cherry on top. </p>
    <p class="normal">Therefore, even when the goal is to assess model fairness, the model should be stress-tested for robustness. Most relevant feature importances and interactions should be understood. Otherwise, it won’t matter if predictions aren’t robust and transparent.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker1534"/> many interpretation methods covered in <em class="italic">Figure 14.1</em>, and these are by no means every interpretation method available. They represent the most popular methods with well-maintained open-source libraries behind them. In this book, we have touched on most of them, albeit some of them only briefly. Those that weren’t discussed are in <em class="italic">italics</em> and those that were discussed have the relevant chapter numbers provided next to them. There’s been a focus <a id="_idIndexMarker1535"/>on <strong class="keyWord">model-agnostic</strong> methods for <strong class="keyWord">black-box supervised learning models</strong>. Still, outside <a id="_idIndexMarker1536"/>of this realm, there are also many other interpretation methods, such as those found in reinforcement learning, generative models, or the many statistical methods used strictly for linear regression. And even within the supervised learning black-box model realm, there are hundreds of application-specific model interpretation methods used for applications ranging from chemistry graph CNNs to customer churn classifiers.</p>
    <p class="normal">That being said, many of the methods discussed in this book can be tailored to a wide variety of applications. Integrated gradients can be used to interpret audio classifiers and weather forecasting models. Sensitivity analysis can be employed in financial modeling and infectious disease risk models. Causal inference methods can be leveraged to improve user experience and drug trials.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Improve</em> is the operative word here because interpretation methods have a flip side!</p>
    <p class="normal">In this book, that flip side has been referred to as <em class="italic">tuning for interpretability</em>, which means creating solutions to problems with FAT. Those solutions can be appreciated in <em class="italic">Figure 14.2</em>:</p>
    <p class="packt_figref"><img src="../Images/18406_14_02.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.2: Toolset to treat FAT issues</p>
    <p class="normal">I have observed <a id="_idIndexMarker1537"/>five approaches to interpretability solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Mitigating Bias</strong>: Any <a id="_idIndexMarker1538"/>corrective measure that is taken to account for bias. Please note that this bias refers to the sampling, exclusion, prejudice, and measurement biases in the data, along with any other bias introduced into the ML workflow.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Placing Guardrails</strong>: Any <a id="_idIndexMarker1539"/>solution that ensures that the model is constrained so that it doesn’t contradict the domain knowledge and predict without confidence.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Enhancing Reliability</strong>: Any <a id="_idIndexMarker1540"/>fix that increases the confidence and consistency of predictions, excluding those that do so by reducing complexity.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Reducing Complexity</strong>: Any <a id="_idIndexMarker1541"/>means by which sparsity is introduced. As a side effect, this generally enhances reliability by generalizing better.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Ensuring Privacy</strong>: Any <a id="_idIndexMarker1542"/>effort to secure private data and model architecture from third parties. We didn’t cover this approach in this book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">There are also three areas in which these approaches can be applied:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Data (“preprocessing”)</strong>: By modifying the training data</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Model (“in-processing”)</strong>: By modifying the model, its parameters, or training procedure</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Prediction (“postprocessing”)</strong>: By intervening in the inference of the model</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">There’s a <a id="_idIndexMarker1543"/>fourth area that can impact the other three – namely, data and algorithmic governance. This includes regulations and standards that dictate a certain methodology or framework. It’s a missing column because very few industries and jurisdictions have laws dictating what methods and approaches should be applied to comply with FAT. For instance, governance could impose a standard for explaining algorithmic decisions, data provenance, or a robustness certification threshold. We will discuss this further in the next section.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can tell in <em class="italic">Figure 14.2</em> that<a id="_idIndexMarker1544"/> many of the methods <a id="_idIndexMarker1545"/>repeat themselves for FAT. <strong class="keyWord">Feature Selection and Engineering, Monotonic Constraints</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Regularization</strong> benefit<a id="_idIndexMarker1546"/> all three but are not always leveraged by the same approach. <strong class="keyWord">Data Augmentation</strong> also<a id="_idIndexMarker1547"/> can enhance reliability for fairness and accountability. As with <em class="italic">Figure 14.1</em>, the items in italics were not covered in the book, of which three topics stand out: <strong class="keyWord">Uncertainty Estimation</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Adversarial Robustness</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Privacy Preservation</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker1548"/>fascinating <a id="_idIndexMarker1549"/>topics <a id="_idIndexMarker1550"/>and deserve books of their own.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-402" class="heading-2">Current trends</h2>
    <p class="normal">One of <a id="_idIndexMarker1551"/>the most significant deterrents of AI adoption is a lack of interpretability, which is partially the reason why 50-90% of AI projects never take off (see the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section for articles about this), and the other is the ethical transgressions that happen as a result of not complying with FAT. In this aspect, <strong class="keyWord">Interpretable Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">iML</strong>) has<a id="_idIndexMarker1552"/> the power to lead ML as a whole because it can help with both goals with the corresponding methods in <em class="italic">Figure 14.1</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 14.2</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Thankfully, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1553"/> are witnessing an increase in interest and production in iML, mostly<a id="_idIndexMarker1554"/> under <strong class="keyWord">Explainable Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">XAI</strong>) – see <em class="italic">Figure 14.3</em>. In the scientific community, iML is still the most popular term, but XAI dominates in public settings:</p>
    <p class="packt_figref"><img src="../Images/18406_14_03.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated"/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.3: Publication and search trends for iML and XAI</p>
    <p class="normal">This means that just as ML is starting to get standardized, regulated, consolidated, and integrated into a whole host of other disciplines, interpretation will soon get a seat at the table.</p>
    <p class="normal">ML is <a id="_idIndexMarker1555"/>replacing software in all industries. And as more is getting automated, more models are deployed to the cloud, and it will get worse with<a id="_idIndexMarker1556"/> the <strong class="keyWord">Artificial Intelligence of Things</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AIoT</strong>). Deployment is not traditionally in the ML practitioner’s wheelhouse. That is why ML increasingly depends on <strong class="keyWord">Machine Learning Operations</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">MLOps</strong>). And <a id="_idIndexMarker1557"/>the pace of automation means more tools are needed to build, test, deploy, and monitor these models. At the same time, there’s a need for the standardization of tools, methods, and metrics. Slowly but surely, this is happening. Since 2017, we have had the <strong class="keyWord">Open Neural Network Exchange</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">ONNX</strong>), an<a id="_idIndexMarker1558"/> open standard for interoperability. And at the time of writing, the <strong class="keyWord">International Organization for Standardization</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">ISO</strong>) has <a id="_idIndexMarker1559"/>over two dozen AI standards being written (and one published), several of which involve interpretability. Naturally, some things will get standardized because of common use, due to the consolidation of ML model classes, methods, libraries, service providers, and practices. Over time, one or a few in each area will emerge. Lastly, given ML’s outsized role in algorithmic decision-making, it’s only a matter of time before it is regulated. Only some financial markets regulate trading algorithms, such as the <strong class="keyWord">Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">SEC</strong>) in <a id="_idIndexMarker1560"/>the United States and <a id="_idIndexMarker1561"/>the <strong class="keyWord">Financial Conduct Authority</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">FCA</strong>) in the UK. Besides that, only data privacy and provenance regulations are widely enforced, such as the HIPAA in the US and the LGPD in Brazil. The GDPR in the European Union takes this a bit further with the “right to an explanation” for algorithmic decisions but the intended scope and methodology are still unclear.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">XAI versus IML – which one to use?</strong></p>
      <p class="normal">My take: although they are understood as synonyms in industry and <em class="italic">iML</em> is regarded as more of an academic term, ML practitioners, even those in industry, should be wary about using the term <em class="italic">XAI</em>. Words can have outsized suggestive power. <em class="italic">Explainable</em> presumes full understanding, but <em class="italic">interpretable</em> leaves room for error, as there always should be when talking about models, and extraordinarily complex black-box ones at that. Furthermore, AI has captured the public imagination as a panacea or has been vilified as dangerous. Either way, along with the term <em class="italic">explainable</em>, it serves to make it even more filled with hubris for those who think it’s a panacea and perhaps calm some concerns for those who think it’s dangerous. XAI term might be serving a purpose as a marketing term. However, for those who build models, the suggestive power of the word <em class="italic">explainable</em> can make us overconfident in our interpretations. That being said, this is just an opinion.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">ML interpretability<a id="_idIndexMarker1562"/> is growing quickly but is lagging behind ML. Some interpretation tools have been integrated into the cloud ecosystem, from SageMaker to DataRobot. They are yet to be fully automated, standardized, consolidated, and regulated, but there’s no doubt that this will happen.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-403" class="heading-1">Speculating on the future of ML interpretability</h1>
    <p class="normal">I’m used <a id="_idIndexMarker1563"/>to hearing the metaphor of this period being the “Wild West of AI”, or worse, an “AI Gold Rush!” It conjures images of an unexplored and untamed territory being eagerly conquered, or worse, civilized. Yet, in the 19th century, the United States western areas were not too different from other regions on the planet and had already been inhabited by Native Americans for millennia, so the metaphor doesn’t quite work. Predicting with the accuracy and confidence that we can achieve with ML would spook our ancestors and is not a “natural” position for us humans. It’s more akin to flying than exploring unknown land.</p>
    <p class="normal">The article <em class="italic">Toward the Jet Age of machine learning</em> (linked in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section at the end of this chapter) presents a much more fitting metaphor of AI being like the dawn of aviation. It’s new and exciting, and people still marvel at what we can do from down below (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.4</em>)!</p>
    <p class="normal">However, aviation had yet to fulfill its potential. Decades after the barnstorming era, aviation matured into the safe, reliable, and efficient Jet Age of <strong class="keyWord">commercial aviation</strong>. In the case of aviation, the promise was that it could reliably take goods and people halfway around the world in less than a day. In AI’s case, the promise is that it can make fair, accountable, and transparent decisions – maybe not for any decision, but at least those it was designed to make unless it’s an example of <strong class="keyWord">Artificial General Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AGI</strong>):</p>
    <p class="packt_figref"><img src="../Images/18406_14_04.png" alt="A picture containing text, outdoor, old  Description automatically generated"/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.4: Barnstorming during the 1920s (United States Library of Congress’s Prints and Photographs Division)</p>
    <p class="normal">So how <a id="_idIndexMarker1564"/>do we get there? The following are a few ideas I anticipate will occur in the pursuit of reaching the Jet Age of ML.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-404" class="heading-2">A new vision for ML</h2>
    <p class="normal">As <a id="_idIndexMarker1565"/>we intend to go farther with AI than we have ever gone before, the ML practitioners of tomorrow must be more aware of the dangers of the sky. And by the sky, I mean the new frontiers of predictive and prescriptive analytics. The risks are numerous and involve all kinds of biases and assumptions, problems with data both known and potential, and our models’ mathematical properties and limitations. It’s easy to be deceived by ML models thinking they are software. Still, in this analogy, the software is completely deterministic in nature – it’s solidly anchored to the ground, not hovering in the sky!</p>
    <p class="normal">For civil aviation to become safe, it required a new mindset – a new culture. The fighter pilots of WWII, as capable as they were, had to be retrained to work in civil aviation. It’s not the same mission because when you know that you are carrying passengers on board and the stakes are high, everything changes. </p>
    <p class="normal">Ethical AI, and by extension, iML, ultimately require this awareness that models directly or indirectly carry passengers “on board,” and that models aren’t as robust as they seem. A robust model must be able to reliably <a id="_idIndexMarker1566"/>withstand almost any condition over and over again in the same way the planes of today do. To that end, we need to be using more instruments, and those instruments come in the form of interpretation methods.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-405" class="heading-2">A multidisciplinary approach</h2>
    <p class="normal">Tighter <a id="_idIndexMarker1567"/>integration with many disciplines is needed for models that comply with the principles of FAT. This means more significant involvement of AI ethicists, lawyers, sociologists, psychologists, human-centered designers, and countless other professions. Along with AI technologists and software engineers, they will help code best practices into standards and regulations.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-406" class="heading-2">Adequate standardization</h2>
    <p class="normal">New<a id="_idIndexMarker1568"/> standards will be needed not only for code, metrics, and methodologies but also for language. The language behind data has mostly been derived from statistics, math, computer science, and econometrics, which leads to a lot of confusion.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-407" class="heading-2">Enforcing regulation</h2>
    <p class="normal">It will likely be<a id="_idIndexMarker1569"/> required that all production models fulfill the following specifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Are certifiably robust and fair</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Are capable of explaining their reasoning behind one prediction with a TRACE command and, in some cases, are required to deliver the reasoning with the prediction</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Can abstain from a prediction they aren’t confident about</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Yield confidence levels for all predictions (see the <strong class="keyWord">conformal prediction</strong> tutorial and book in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Have metadata with training data provenance (even if anonymized) and authorship and, when needed, regulatory compliance certificates and metadata tied to a public ledger – possibly a blockchain</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Have security certificates much like websites do to ensure a certain level of trust</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Expire, and stop working upon expiration, until they are retrained with new data</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Be taken offline automatically when they fail model diagnostics and only put online again when they pass</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Have <strong class="keyWord">Continuous Training/Continuous Integration</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CT/CI</strong>) pipelines that help retrain the model and perform the model diagnostics at regular intervals to avoid any model downtime</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Are diagnosed by a certified AI auditor when they fail catastrophically and cause public damage</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">New<a id="_idIndexMarker1570"/> regulations will likely create new professions such as AI auditors and model diagnostics engineers. But they will also prop up MLOps engineers and ML automation tools.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-408" class="heading-2">Seamless machine learning automation with built-in interpretation</h2>
    <p class="normal">In the future, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1571"/>won’t program an ML pipeline; it will mostly be a drag-and-drop capability with a dashboard offering all kinds of metrics. It will evolve to be mostly automated. Automation shouldn’t come as a surprise because some existing libraries perform automated feature-selection model training. Some interpretability-enhancing procedures may be done automatically, but most of them will require human discretion. However, interpretation ought to be injected throughout the process, much like planes that mostly fly themselves have instruments that alert pilots of issues; the value is in informing the ML practitioner of potential problems and improvements at every step. Did it find a feature to recommend for monotonic constraints? Did it find some imbalances that might need adjusting? Did it find anomalies in the data that might need some correction? Show the practitioner what needs to be seen to make an informed decision and let them make it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-409" class="heading-2">Tighter integration with MLOps engineers</h2>
    <p class="normal">Certifiably<a id="_idIndexMarker1572"/> robust models trained, validated, and deployed at a click of a button require more than just cloud infrastructure – they also need the orchestration of tools, configurations, and people trained in MLOps to monitor them and perform maintenance at regular intervals.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-410" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">Interpretable machine learning is an extensive topic, and this book has only covered some aspects of some of its most important areas on two levels: diagnosis and treatment. Practitioners can leverage the tools offered by the toolkit anywhere in the ML pipeline. However, it’s up to the practitioner to choose when and how to apply them.</p>
    <p class="normal">What matters most is to engage with the tools. Not using the interpretable machine learning toolkit is like flying a plane with very few instruments or none at all. Much like flying a plane operates under different weather conditions, machine learning models operate under different data conditions, and to be a skilled pilot or machine learning engineer, we can’t be overconfident and validate or rule out hypotheses with our instruments. And much like aviation took a few decades to become the safest mode of transportation, it will take AI a few decades to become the safest mode of decision-making. It will take a global village to get us there, but it will be an exciting journey! And remember, <em class="italic">the best way to predict the future is to create it</em>.</p>
