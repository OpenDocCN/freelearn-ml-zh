- en: The data-centric **machine learning** (**ML**) approach has been created in
    response to the limitations of the model-centric paradigm. Although the data-centric
    perspective opens up incredible opportunities for the application of ML across
    new and existing domains, it doesn’t mean it’s easy to implement.

- en: The appeal of the model-centric approach is its relative simplicity. Its dominance
    in the field isn’t necessarily because it’s superior, but rather because it’s
    more straightforward. It focuses primarily on refining models, tweaking algorithms,
    and enhancing computational power. However, this approach often neglects a fundamental
    aspect of ML – the quality and relevance of the data feeding these models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data-centric approach, on the other hand, prioritizes improving data quality
    over perfecting models. It recognizes that even the most sophisticated models
    can falter if they’re built on a shaky foundation of poorly curated or irrelevant
    data.

    focus is primarily on the model – choosing the right algorithm, tuning hyperparameters,
    and optimizing performance metrics. This model-centric approach often involves
    countless iterations of tweaking the model to squeeze out a bit more accuracy.
    However, while models are undoubtedly important, this approach can sometimes lead
    to overlooking other equally crucial aspects, such as the quality and relevancy
    of the data feeding these models.'

    matter how sophisticated an ML model is, its performance is ultimately determined
    by the quality and quantity of the data it is trained on. Poor quality data can
    lead to inaccurate predictions, while insufficient data may result in overfitting,
    where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen
    data.'

    of certain events.'

    irrelevant, incomplete, or noisy for our specific ML task.'

    stack grows over time. As the tech stack expands, adding more software, platforms,

    management and organization, this can lead to increased complexity and “disorder.”

    processes could fall through the cracks – this is the “entropy” in our scenario.
