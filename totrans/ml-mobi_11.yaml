    requires specialized processors. But if the power of ML can be brought to mobile
    devices that lack such processing power and also work in offline mode, there will
    be enormous opportunities and an entire new business category with a whole gamut
    of innovative useful mobile applications that are very hard to imagine otherwise.
    The entire way customers and businesses connect with each other would be reshaped.'

    hard to find anyone without a mobile phone with them always. If a mobile phone
    is going to be a part of the human being, then, just as the eyes, nose, legs,
    and so on know what we do daily and have got accustomed to our lifestyle, in a
    similar manner, mobile phones can also understand the ins and outs of our daily
    routine and can bring out so many key data points, which we may not have had the
    time to analyze ourselves.

    organizations that it is easy for third parties to get a deeper insight into our
    lifestyle, life pattern, and deep secrets, and take many different actions based
    on the key pointers gathered. There may be possibilities that not only benefit
    these third parties, but may also benefit us. They can try to make us aware of
    things that we were ignorant of as regards ourselves or suggest better ways to
    perform certain activities we do, thus improving our life overall. The possibilities
    are infinite and left to our imagination on how ML in mobile can be achieved and

    where ML in mobile devices becomes key. The sensors sending out different information
    from time to time can be kept close to the sensor, rather than transmitting all
    the way to a server. Different protocols could be used to communicate between
    the sensors and mobile devices for such data exchange and timely actions could
    be taken swiftly. Here, again, the possibilities are innumerable, groundbreaking
    innovations are happening, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
