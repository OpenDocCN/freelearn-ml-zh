<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Before I started working in the field of AI/ML, I spent many years building computer software platforms for large financial </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">services institutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Some of the business problems I worked on had complex rules, such as identifying companies for comparable analysis for investment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">banking deals or creating a master database for all the different companies’ identifiers from the different data providers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">We had to implement hardcoded rules in database-stored procedures and application server backends to solve these problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">We often debated if certain rules made sense or not for the business problems we tried to solve. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">As rules changed, we had to reimplement the rules and make sure the changes did not break anything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">To test for new releases or changes, we often replied to human experts to exhaustively test and validate all the business logic implemented before the production release. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">It was a very time-consuming and error-prone process and required a significant amount of engineering, testing against the documented specification, and rigorous change management for deployment every time new rules were introduced, or existing rules needed to be changed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">We often replied to users to report business logic issues in production, and when an issue was reported in production, we sometimes had to open up the source code to troubleshoot or explain the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> logic of how it worked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">I remember I often asked myself if there were better ways to do this.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">After I started working in the field of AI/ML, I started to solve many similar challenges using ML techniques. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">With ML, I did </span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">not need to come up with complex rules that often require deep data and domain expertise to create or maintain the complex rules for decision making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Instead, I focused on collecting high-quality data and used ML algorithms to learn the rules and patterns from the data directly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">This new approach eliminated many of the challenging aspects of creating new rules (for example, a deep domain expertise requirement, or avoiding human bias) and maintaining existing rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">To validate the model before the production release, we could examine model performance metrics such as </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">accuracy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">While it still required data science expertise to interpret the model metrics against the nature of the business problems and dataset, it did not require exhaustive manual testing of all the different scenarios. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">When a model was deployed into production, we would monitor if the model performed as expected by monitoring any significant changes in production data versus the data we have collected for model training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.4">We would collect new unseen data and labels for production data and test the model performance periodically to ensure that its predictive accuracy remains robust when faced with new, previously unseen production data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.5">To explain why a model made a decision the way it did, we did not need to open up the source code to re-examine the hardcoded logic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.6">Instead, we would rely on ML techniques to help explain the relative importance of different input features to understand what factors were most influential in the decision-making by the ML models.</span></p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-16"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">ML lifecycle</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">One of the early ML projects that I worked on was a fascinating yet daunting sports predictive analytics problem</span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> for a major league brand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I was given a list of predictive analytics outcomes to think about to see if there were ML solutions for the problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">I was a casual viewer of the sport; I didn’t know anything about the analytics to be generated, nor the rules of the games in the detail that was needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">I was provided with some sample data but had no idea what to do with it.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">The first thing I started to work on was an immersion in the sport itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">I delved into the intricacies of the game, studying the different player positions and events that make up each game and play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">Only after being armed with the newfound domain knowledge did the data start to make sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">Together with the stakeholder, we evaluated the impact of the different analytics outcomes and assessed the modeling feasibility based on the data we had. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.5">With a clear understanding of the data, we came up with a couple of top ML analytics with the most business impact to focus on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.6">We also decided how they would be integrated into the existing business workflow, and how they would be measured on their impacts.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Subsequently, I delved deeper into</span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> the data to ascertain what information was available and what was lacking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">The raw dataset had a lot of irrelevant data points that needed to be removed while the relevant data points needed to be transformed to provide the strongest signals for model training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">I processed and prepared the dataset based on a few of the ML algorithms I had considered and conducted experiments to determine the best approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">I lacked a tool to track the different experiment results, so I had to document what I had done manually. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">After some initial rounds of experimentation, it became evident that the existing data was not sufficient to train a high-performance model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.6">Hence, I decided to build a custom deep learning model to incorporate data of different modalities as the data points had temporal dependencies and required additional spatial information for the modeling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.7">The data owner was able to provide the additional datasets I required, and after more experiments with custom algorithms and significant data preparations and feature engineering, I eventually trained a model that met the business objectives.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">After completing the model, another hard challenge began – deploying and operationalizing the model in production and integrating it into the existing business workflow and system architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">We engaged in many architecture and engineering discussions and eventually built out a deployment architecture for the model.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">As you can see from my personal experience, the journey from business idea to ML production deployment involved many steps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">A typical lifecycle of an ML project follows a formal structure, which includes several essential stages like business understanding, data acquisition and understanding, data preparation, model building, model evaluation, and model deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">Since a big component of the lifecycle is experimentation with different datasets, features, and algorithms, the whole process is highly iterative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.4">Furthermore, it is essential to note that there is no guarantee of a successful outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.5">Factors such as the availability and quality of data, feature engineering techniques (the process of using domain knowledge to extract useful features from raw data), and the capability of the learning algorithms, among others, can all affect the final results.</span></p>

<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Product or service revenue improvements, such as better target marketing, new insight generation for better decision making, and increased customer satisfaction.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">To measure the success, you may use specific business metrics such as the number of hours reduced in a business process, an increased number of true positive frauds detected, a conversion rate improvement from target marketing, or the number of churn rate reductions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">This is an essential step to get right to ensure there is sufficient justification for an ML project </span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">and that the outcome of the project can be successfully measured.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">After you have defined the business goals and business metrics, you need to evaluate if there is an ML solution for the business problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">While ML has a wide scope of applications, it is not always an optimal solution for every business problem.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-18"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Data understanding and data preparation</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">The saying that “data is the new oil” holds particularly true for ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">Without the required data, you cannot move </span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">forward with an ML project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">That’s why the next step in the ML lifecycle is </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">data acquisition</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">, </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">understanding</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">, and </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">preparation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Based on the business problems and ML approach, you will need to gather and comprehend the available data to determine if you have the right data and data volume to solve the ML problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">For example, suppose the business problem to address is credit card fraud detection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">In that case, you will need datasets such as historical credit card transaction data, customer demographics, account data, device usage data, and networking access data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.4">Detailed data analysis is then necessary to determine if the dataset features and quality are sufficient for the modeling tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.5">You also need to decide if the data needs labeling, such as </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">fraud</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> or </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">not-fraud</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">During this step, depending on the data quality, a significant amount of data wrangling might be performed to prepare and clean the data and to generate the dataset for model training and model evaluation, depending on the data quality.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Using the training and validation datasets established, a data scientist must run a number of experiments using </span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">different ML algorithms and dataset features for feature selection and model development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">This is a highly iterative process and could require numerous runs of data processing and model development to find the right algorithm and dataset combination for optimal model performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">In addition to model performance, factors such as data bias and model explainability may need to be considered to comply with internal or regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Prior to deployment into production, the model quality must be validated using the relevant technical metrics, such </span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">as the </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">accuracy score</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">This is usually accomplished using a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">holdout dataset</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">, also known as a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">test dataset</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">, to gauge</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1"> how the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> model performs on unseen data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">It is crucial to understand which metrics are appropriate for model validation, as they vary depending on the ML problems and the dataset used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">For example, model accuracy would be a suitable validation metric for a document classification use case if the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">number of document types is relatively balanced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">However, model accuracy would not be a good metric to evaluate the model performance for a fraud detection use case – this is because the number of frauds is small and even if the model predicts </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">not-fraud</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> all the time, the model accuracy could still be very high.</span></p>
