    series of inputs (system experience), is able to reclassify and organize on the
    basis of common characteristics to try to make predictions on subsequent inputs.
    Unlike supervised learning, only unlabeled examples are provided to the learner
    during the learning process, as the classes are not known a priori but must be

- en: Unsupervised learning techniques work by comparing data and looking for similarities
    or differences. As is known, machine learning algorithms try to imitate the functioning
    of an animal's nervous system. For this purpose, we can hypothesize that neural
    processes are guided by mechanisms that optimize the unknown objective they pursue.
    Each process evolves from an initial situation associated with a stimulus to a
    terminal in which there is an answer, which is the result of the process itself.
    It is intuitive that, in this evolution, there is a transfer of information. In
    fact, the stimulus provides the information necessary to obtain the desired response.
    Therefore, it is important that this information is transmitted as faithfully
    as possible until the process is completed. A reasonable criterion for interpreting
    the processes that take place in the nervous system is, therefore, to consider
    them as transfers of information with maximum preservation of the same.

- en: Unsupervised learning algorithms are based on these concepts. It is a question
    of using learning theory techniques to measure the loss of information that has
    occurred in the transfer. The process under consideration is considered as the
    transmission of a signal through a noisy channel, using well-known techniques
    developed in the field of communications. It is possible, however, to follow a
    different approach based on a geometric representation of the process. In fact,
    both the stimulus and the response are characterized by an appropriate number
    of components, which in a space correspond to a point. Thus, the process can be
    interpreted as a geometric transformation of the input space to the output space.
    The exit space has a smaller size than the input space, as the stimulus contains
    the information necessary to activate many simultaneous processes. Compared to
    only one, it is redundant. This means that there is always a redundancy reduction
    operation in the transformation under consideration.

  zh: 无监督学习算法基于这些概念。这是一个使用学习理论技术来衡量在传输过程中发生的信息损失的问题。考虑的过程被视为通过通信领域开发出的已知技术来传输信号的噪声信道。然而，也可以遵循基于过程几何表示的不同方法。实际上，刺激和响应都由适当数量的组件表征，这些组件在空间中对应于一个点。因此，这个过程可以解释为输入空间到输出空间的几何变换。输出空间的大小小于输入空间，因为刺激包含了激活许多同时进行的过程所需的信息。与只有一个相比，它是冗余的。这意味着在考虑的变换中始终存在冗余减少操作。
- en: In the entry and exit space, typical regions are formed, with which the information
    is associated. The natural mechanism that controls the transfer of information
    must therefore identify, in some way, these important regions for the process
    under consideration, and make sure that they correspond in the transformation.
    Thus, a data grouping operation is present in the process in question; this operation
    can be identified with the acquisition of experience. The two previous operations
    of grouping and reduction of redundancy are typical of optimal signal processing,
    and there is biological evidence of their existence in the functioning of the
    nervous system. It is interesting to note that these two operations are automatically
    achieved in the case of non-supervised learning based on experimental principles,
    such as competitive learning.

    are the result of the combination of deep learning and Bayesian inference, in
    the sense that they consist of a neural network trained with the backpropagation
    algorithm modified with a technique called **re-parameterization**. While deep

    for a given input but calculates the mean and variance of a normal distribution.
    A value is taken from this distribution and it is decoded by the decoder. The
    training consists of modifying the encoder and decoder parameters so that the
    result of the decoded so carried out is as similar as possible to the starting
    image. At the end of the training, we have that starting from the normal distribution
    with mean and variance produced by the encoder; the decoder will be able to produce
    images similar to those belonging to the training set.

    predictors. As we can see, the variables have different ranges. When the predictors
    have different ranges, the impact on response variables by the feature having
    a greater numeric range could be more than the one having a less numeric range,
    and this could, in turn, impact the prediction accuracy. Our goal is to improve
    predictive accuracy and not allow a particular feature to impact the prediction
    due to a large numeric value range. Thus, we may need to scale values under different
    features such that they fall under a common range. Through this statistical procedure,
    it is possible to compare identical variables belonging to different distributions
    and also different variables or variables expressed in different units.

    activity on previously unexplored fields such as the generation of art in the
    broad sense. To do this, Magenta wanted to create a physical place, where all
    people united by the same interest (that is, generation of art) could exchange
    ideas and products. In other words, a community of artists, programmers, and researchers
    of machine learning.'

    train a machine learning algorithm, it is necessary to have a dataset containing
    an important number of observations. Recently, the increased use of generative
    models has been applied to images thanks to the availability of high-quality image
    datasets, which therefore correspond to a significant data set. With this in mind,
    the Google Brain team has made NSynth available. It's a large-scale, high-quality
    set of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public
    datasets. The aim is to have a significant audio dataset in order to develop generative
    models with better performance.

    **notes**, spanning each step of a standard MIDI piano or (21-108) and five different
    speeds (25, 50, 75, 100, and 127). The note was kept for the first 3 seconds and

- en: In this chapter, we explored one of the most interesting research sites on modeling
    with neural networks. First we saw an introduction to unsupervised learning algorithms.
    Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique that, starting from a series
    of inputs (system experience), will be able to reclassify and organize on the
    basis of common characteristics to try to make predictions on subsequent inputs.
    Unlike supervised learning, only unlabeled examples are provided to the learner
    during the learning process, as the classes are not known a priori but must be
    learned automatically.

    a probabilistic graphic model that can be interpreted as a stochastic neural network.
    In practice, a Boltzmann machine is a model (including a certain number of parameters)
    that, when applied to a data distribution, is able to provide a representation.
    This model can be used to extract important aspects of an unknown distribution
    (target distribution) starting only from a sample of the latter.

    dimensions and the result obtained to be able to reconstruct the input itself.
    The purpose of autoencoders is not simply to perform a sort of compression of
    the input or look for an approximation of the identity function; but there are
    techniques that allow us to direct the model (starting from a hidden layer of
    reduced dimensions) to give greater importance to some data properties. Thus they
    give rise to different representations based on the same data.

    called **generator** and **discriminator**. The dynamics between these two networks
    is like a forger and an investigator. The forger tries to produce faithful imitations
    of authentic works of art while the investigator tries to distinguish the fakes
    from the originals.
