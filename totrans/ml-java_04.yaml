- en: The most practical way to build knowledge on customer behavior is to produce
    scores that explain a target variable, such as churn, appetency, or upselling.
    The score is computed by a model using input variables that describe customers;
    for example, their current subscription, purchased devices, consumed minutes,
    and so on. The scores are then used by the information system for things like
    providing relevant personalized marketing actions.

- en: A customer is the main entity in most of the customer-based relationship databases;
    getting to know the customer's behavior is important. The customer's behavior
    produces a score in relation to the churn, appetency, or upselling. The basic
    idea is to produce a score using a computational model, which may use different
    parameters, such as the current subscription of the customer, devices purchased,
    minutes consumed, and so on. Once the score is formed, it is used by the information
    system to decide on the next strategy, which is especially designed for the customer,
    based on his or her behavior.

    technique that is able to take advantage of the variety of base classifiers without
