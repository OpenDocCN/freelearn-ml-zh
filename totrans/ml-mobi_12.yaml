    of many fields, such as mathematics, machine learning, computer programming, statistical
    modeling, data engineering and visualization, pattern recognition and learning,
    uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and cloud computing. The skills required
    to pursue these fields include engineering, maths, science, statistics, programming,
    creativity and data keeping, and maintenance.
