- en: Convolution is a fundamental operation in image processing. We basically apply
    a mathematical operator to each pixel and change its value in some way. To apply
    this mathematical operator, we use another matrix called a **kernel**. The kernel
    is usually much smaller in size than the input image. For each pixel in the image,
    we take the kernel and place it on top such that the center of the kernel coincides
    with the pixel under consideration. We then multiply each value in the kernel
    matrix with the corresponding values in the image, and then sum it up. This is
    the new value that will be substituted in this position in the output image.

- en: Blurring refers to averaging the pixel values within a neighborhood. This is
    also called a **low pass filter**. A low pass filter is a filter that allows low
    frequencies and blocks higher frequencies. Now, the next question that comes to
    our mind is—What does "frequency" mean in an image? Well, in this context, frequency
    refers to the rate of change of pixel values. So we can say that the sharp edges
    would be high frequency content because the pixel values change rapidly in that
    region. Going by that logic, plain areas would be low frequency content. Going
    by this definition, a low pass filter would try to smoothen the edges.

- en: 'A simple way to build a low pass filter is by uniformly averaging the values
    in the neighborhood of a pixel. We can choose the size of the kernel depending
    on how much we want to smoothen the image, and it will correspondingly have different
    effects. If you choose a bigger size, then you will be averaging over a larger
    area. This tends to increase the smoothening effect. Let''s see what a 3x3 low
    pass filter kernel looks like:'

    This is called **normalization**, and it's important because we don't want to
    artificially increase the intensity value at that pixel's location. So you should
    normalize the kernel before applying it to an image. Normalization is a really
    important concept, and it is used in a variety of scenarios, so you should read
    a couple of tutorials online to get a good grasp on it.

    you can see that they keep getting blurrier as we increase the kernel size. The

    over a larger area. This tends to have a larger blurring effect.

    producing a binary image as the output. Typically, we draw white lines on a black
    background to indicate those edges. We can think of edge detection as a high pass
    filtering operation. A high pass filter allows high frequency content to pass
    through and blocks the low frequency content. As we discussed earlier, edges are
    high frequency content. In edge detection, we want to retain these edges and discard
    everything else. Hence, we should build a kernel that is the equivalent of a high
    pass filter.

    two numbers as arguments to indicate the thresholds. The second argument is called
    the low threshold value, and the third argument is called the high threshold value.
    If the gradient value is above the high threshold value, it is marked as a strong
    edge. The Canny Edge Detector starts tracking the edge from this point and continues
    the process until the gradient value falls below the low threshold value. As you
    increase these thresholds, the weaker edges will be ignored. The output image
    will be cleaner and sparser. You can play around with the thresholds and see what
    happens as you increase or decrease their values. The overall formulation is quite
    deep. You can learn more about it at [http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/~petrakis/courses/computervision/canny.pdf](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/~petrakis/courses/computervision/canny.pdf)

    be wondering how to handle color images. The thing about histogram equalization
    is that it's a nonlinear process. So, we cannot just separate out the three channels
    in an RGB image, equalize the histogram separately, and combine them later to
    form the output image. The concept of histogram equalization is only applicable
    to the intensity values in the image. So, we have to make sure not to modify the
    color information when we do this.

- en: In order to handle the histogram equalization of color images, we need to convert
    it to a color space where intensity is separated from the color information. YUV
    is a good example of such a color space. Once we convert it to YUV, we just need
    to equalize the Y-channel and combine it with the other two channels to get the
    output image.

    to images. We discussed the fundamental image processing operators and how we
    can use them to build various things. We learnt how to detect edges using various
    methods. We understood the importance of 2D convolution and how we can use it
    in different scenarios. We discussed how to smoothen, motion-blur, sharpen, emboss,
    erode, and dilate an image. We learned how to create a vignette filter, and how
    we can change the region of focus as well. We discussed contrast enhancement and
    how we can use histogram equalization to achieve it. In the next chapter, we will
    discuss how to cartoonize a given image.
