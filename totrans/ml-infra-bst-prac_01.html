			<p>Traditionally, Machine Learning (ML) was considered to be a niche domain in software engineering. No large software systems used statistical learning in production. This changed in the 2010s when recommendation systems started to utilize large quantities of data – for example, to recommend movies, books, or music. With the rise of transformer technologies, this has changed. Commonly known products such as ChatGPT popularized these techniques and showed that they are no longer niche products, but have entered the mainstream software products and services. Software engineering needs to keep up and we need to know how to create the software based on these modern machine learning models. In this first part of the book, we look at how machine learning changes software development and how we need to adapt to <span class="No-Break">these changes.</span></p>
