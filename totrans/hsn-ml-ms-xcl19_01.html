<p class="mce-root"><span>The objective of part 1 is to introduce the reader to machine learning and the different types of models used. It will cover supervised and unsupervised learning, the principal division within machine learning. Within these aspects, the difference between regression (continuous target variable) and classification (discrete target variable) will be demonstrated. All points are explained by means of hands-on examples.</span></p>
