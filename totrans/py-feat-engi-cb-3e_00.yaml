- en: '*Python Feature Engineering Cookbook*, covers almost every aspect of feature
    engineering for tabular data, including missing data imputation, categorical encoding,
    variable transformation, discretization, scaling, and the handling of outliers.
    It also discusses how to extract features from date and time, text, time series,
    and relational datasets.'

- en: This book will take the pain out of feature engineering by showing you how to
    use open source Python libraries to accelerate the feature engineering process,
    via multiple practical, hands-on recipes. Throughout the book, you will transform
    and create new variables utilizing `pandas` and `scikit-learn`. Additionally,
    you’ll learn to leverage the power of four major open source feature engineering
    libraries – Feature-engine, Category Encoders, Featuretools, and tsfresh.

- en: You’ll also discover additional recipes that weren’t in the second edition.
    These cover imputing missing data in time series, creating new features with decision
    trees, and highlighting outliers using the median absolute deviation. More importantly,
    we provide guidelines to help you decide which transformations to use, based on
    your model and data features. You’ll know exactly what, why, and how to implement
    each feature transformation.

    techniques to replace missing values with suitable estimates for numerical, categorical,
    and time series data. It covers both single and multiple imputation methods and
    demonstrates how to streamline the imputation process using scikit-learn and Feature-engine.'

    covers methods to transform categorical variables into numerical features. It
    begins with common techniques such as one-hot and ordinal encoding and then explores
    adaptations for high cardinality and linear models. The chapter also discusses
    domain-specific methods, such as weight of evidence, and demonstrates how to encode
    highly cardinal variables using methods such as target encoding, ensuring that
    you understand how to regularize the process to avoid overfitting.'

    discusses when and why you need to transform variables for use in machine learning
    models. Then, it shows you different variable transformation functions and highlights
    which types of variables each function is best suited for. By the end of this
    chapter, you’ll understand when you need to transform your variables and why you
    apply the logarithm or the square root, among other functions.'

    introduces the concept of discretization, highlighting its uses in machine learning.
    The chapter then explores various discretization methods, detailing their advantages
    and limitations. It covers the basic equal-with and equal-frequency discretization
    procedures, as well as discretization using decision trees and *k*-means. Finally,
    it pairs discretization with encoding to return variables that are monotonic with
    the target.'

    the use of mathematical operations to combine features based on domain knowledge.
    Then, it discusses how to transform features through the sine, cosine, and the
    use of splines. Finally, it shows you the value of creating features from one
    or more variables through decision trees.'
