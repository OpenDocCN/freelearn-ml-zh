Literally billions of lines of code have been written on the .NET Framework, with billions more to come. For all of its success, it can be argued that the .NET Framework is still underrepresented for data science endeavors. This book attempts to help address this issue by showing how machine learning can be rapidly injected into the common .NET line of business applications. It also shows how typical data science scenarios can be addressed using the .NET Framework. This book quickly builds upon an introduction to machine learning models and techniques in order to build real-world applications using machine learning. While by no means a comprehensive study of predictive analytics, it does address some of the more common issues that data scientists encounter when building their models.</p><p class="calibre6">Many books about machine learning are written with every chapter centering around a dataset and how to implement a model on that dataset. While this is a good way to build a mental blueprint (as well as some code boilerplate), this book is going to take a slightly different approach. This book centers around introducing the same application for the line of business development and one common open data dataset for the scientific programmer. We will then introduce different machine techniques, depending on the business scenario. This means you will be putting on different hats for each chapter. If you are a line of business software engineer, Chapters 2, 3, 6, and 9 will seem like old hat. If you are a research analyst, Chapters 4, 7, and 10 will be very familiar to you. I encourage you to try all chapters, regardless of your background, as you will perhaps gain a new perspective that will make you more effective as a data scientist. As a final note, one word you will not find in this book is "simply". It drives me nuts when I read a tutorial-based book and the author says "it is simply this" or "simply do that". If it was simple, I wouldn't need the book. I hope you find each of the chapters accessible and the code samples interesting, and these two factors can help you immediately in your career.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_1"/>

We will then look at a business problem where customers are dropping orders based on reviews of the product. It looks at creating a linear regression by hand, using Math.NET and Accord.NET to solve this business problem. It then adds this regression to the line of business application.</p><p class="calibre6"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. More AdventureWorks Regression" href="part0029_split_000.html#RL0A2-a18db0be6c20485ba81f22e43ca13055">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">More AdventureWorks Regression</em></span>, looks at creating a multiple linear regression and a logistic regression to solve different business problems at AdventureWorks. It will look at different factors that affect bike sales and then categorize potential customers into potential sales or potential lost leads. It will then implement the models to help our website convert potential lost leads into potential sales.</p><p class="calibre6"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. Traffic Stops – Barking Up the Wrong Tree?" href="part0032_split_000.html#UGI01-a18db0be6c20485ba81f22e43ca13055">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Traffic Stops – Barking Up the Wrong Tree?</em></span>, takes a break from AdventureWorks. You will put on your data scientist hat, use an open dataset of traffic stops, and see if we can understand why some people get a verbal warning and why others get a ticket at a traffic stop. We will use basic summary statistics and decision trees to help in understanding the results.</p><p class="calibre6"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Time Out – Obtaining Data" href="part0036_split_000.html#12AK81-a18db0be6c20485ba81f22e43ca13055">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Time Out – Obtaining Data</em></span>, stops with introducing datasets and machine learning models and concentrates on one of the hardest parts of machine learning—obtaining and cleaning the data. We will look at using F# type providers as a very powerful language feature that can vastly speed up this process of "data munging".</p><p class="calibre6"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 6. AdventureWorks Redux – k-NN and Naïve Bayes Classifiers" href="part0040_split_000.html#164MG1-a18db0be6c20485ba81f22e43ca13055">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">AdventureWorks Redux – k-NN and Naïve Bayes Classifiers</em></span>, goes back to AdventureWorks and looks at a business problem of how to improve cross sales.

Indeed, an argument can be made that the distinction was never really as clear as it has been made out to be in the past. With that, machine learning principles and models are making their way into mainstream computing applications. Consider the Uber app that shows how far Uber drivers are from you, and product recommendations built into online retail sites such as Jet.</p><p class="calibre6">Also, the nature of the .NET software developer's job is changing. Earlier, when the cliché of <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">ours is a changing industry</em></span> was being thrown around, it was about languages (need to know JavaScript, C#, and TSql) and frameworks (Angular, MVC, WPF, and EF). Now, the cliché means that the software developer needs to know how to make sure their code is correct (test-driven development), how to get their code off of their machine onto the customer's machine (DevOps), and how to make their applications smarter (machine learning).</p><p class="calibre6">Also, the same forces that are pushing the business developer to retool are pushing the research analyst into unfamiliar territory. Earlier, analysts focused on data collection, exploration, and visualization in the context of an application (Excel, PowerBI, and SAS) for point-in-time analysis. The analyst would start with a question, grab some data, build some models, and then present the findings. Any kind of continuous analysis was done via report writing or just re-running the models. Today, analysts are being asked to sift through massive amounts of data (IoT telemetry, user exhaust, and NoSQL data lakes), where the questions may not be known beforehand. Also, once models are created, they are pushed into production applications where they are continually being re-trained in real time. No longer just a decision aid for humans, research is being done by computers to impact users immediately.</p><p class="calibre6">The newly-minted data scientist title is at the confluence of these forces. Typically, no one person can be an expert on both sides of the divide, so the data scientist is a bit of a <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">jack of all trades, master of none</em></span> who knows machine learning a little bit better than all of the other software engineers on the team and knows software engineering a little bit better than any researcher on the team. The goal of this book is to help move from either software engineer or business analyst to data scientist.</p></div>
