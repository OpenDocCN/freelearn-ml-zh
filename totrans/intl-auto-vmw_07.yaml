- en: VMware has to deal with things in a fully automated fashion and requires machines
    that can make decisions. They are currently trying to figure out at least automatic
    initiation of the first remedial actions, and only if the machine doesn't respond
    or behave in an expected way is it then calling out for help. This is where the
    trend is heading today, as people innovate with machine learning techniques. VMware
    is gearing up for machine learning-based responses to the infrastructure and applications
    to be able to take action in relation to them and should not depend on any subsystem
    by precisely mentioning the impact on the system in real-time scenarios. We will
    learn about management toolsets, with a focus on machine learning techniques,
    in the next few chapters.
