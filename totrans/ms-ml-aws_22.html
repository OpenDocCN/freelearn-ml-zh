<p>Since we will focus on machine learning on AWS it’s very important that the you get started with AWS by creating an account if not done already. Please visit <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start">https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start</a> . You will need to provide some credit card details, but you will only get charged after you effectively use the different services. Consider that many of the services have a free tier which you can start using at no cost. Once you sign up, the next step is to create a user on the platform which you will use for programmatic access.</p>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home</a> and create user:</p>

<p>Once you create the user, grant some permissions (in our example we will grant full access):</p>

<p>You can optionally set tags to better track costs in case you have multiple users, but we won't focus on that on this book. Once you create the user, you can navigate to that user and create keys:</p>
<p>Once you generate those keys, you can store them in ~/.aws/credentials on your machine, as explained in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html</a>.  By storing the credentials on that file, the code you run on your machine will know how to authenticate with AWS.</p>
