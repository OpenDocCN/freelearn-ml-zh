<p><span>In this section, we will discuss various popular machine learning algorithms and how they work. We will provide examples of situations in which they work well and when they should be avoided. The reader will learn about different machine learning algorithms and will be able to work with simple examples in scikit-learn and scale them into Apache Spark in the context of AWS. After reading the section, we expect readers to have a working knowledge of machine learning algorithms and how to implement them at scale in AWS.</span></p>
