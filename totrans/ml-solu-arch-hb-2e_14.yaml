- en: Another challenge for companies in this stage is acquiring the necessary business
    and technical expertise to execute a pilot project. AI/ML is a complex field that

- en: Most of the customers I worked with four or more years ago fell into this category,
    and the interest and initiative mostly came from senior business and technology
    leaders, such as VPs or directors of engineering, and heads of business functions
    like marketing. Successful companies at this stage usually began with use cases
    that solved real business problems and delivered measurable benefits that resonated
    with other stakeholders in the organization. For example, one organization I worked
    with started with a sports analytics use case that addressed a labor-intensive
    task, resulting in lower costs and faster delivery of insights. On the other hand,
    another organization started with a forward-looking use case that required significant
    ROI analysis and process changes, but it failed to take off. Since these organizations
    usually didn’t have in-house ML expertise, the successful ones typically chose
    to work with partners who had ML experience to get a proof of concept or pilot
    off the ground. At this stage, ML technology stack and infrastructure efficiency
    were usually not a focus for these organizations, as the main goal was to prove
    business value.

    within different departments but lack a cohesive, enterprise-wide strategy for
    AI/ML, and most likely do not have an enterprise ML platform. Each department
    operates its AI/ML initiatives independently, using AI/ML to meet specific business

- en: Fast-forwarding to today, the majority of organizations I work with fall into
    this category. Many of these organizations have limited oversight to validate
    the business benefits of these initiatives in the different silos, which has resulted
    in many of these projects becoming science experiments rather than business-outcome-driven
    initiatives. In addition, the lack of dedicated effort in business process integration
    has resulted in many projects not making it into production. To move forward from
    this stage, some of the organizations I worked with have started initiatives to
    rationalize their AI/ML efforts, including both organizational and technological
    rationalization. For example, several organizations I worked with have established
    a new Chief Data Officer function to oversee data, analytics, and ML initiatives
    across the organization. They started to formulate a multi-year strategy to move
    toward a more integrated organization and technology stack. Many of these organizations

    in managing and monitoring the deployment of ML models.

    is collected accurately and consistently, without the need for manual data entry
    or verification. Automated evidence validation and compliance analysis can also
    help to streamline the compliance review process, reducing the time and effort
    required to manually review and validate evidence.

    of the deployment of ML models. For example, automated monitoring and reporting
    systems can be used to track and report on the performance and impact of the models,
    and to identify any potential risks or issues that may arise.

    and ethical deployment of ML models. By following guidelines and best practices,
    organizations can ensure that their ML models are deployed in a responsible and
    ethical manner that aligns with their overall goals and values. This will not
    only help to prevent potential risks and issues, but also promote transparency
    and trust with customers, stakeholders, and regulators.

- en: The need for responsible development and deployment of AI systems presents significant
    governance challenges due to the complexity and potential risks involved. AI systems
    can perpetuate biases, raise privacy concerns, and have unintended consequences
    if not properly governed. Additionally, the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape
    surrounding AI, such as the EU AI Act and Singapore Model AI Governance Framework,
    demands robust compliance measures. Given these complexities and challenges, instead
    of having individual functions and project teams to navigate through their organization’s
    own principles and external regulatory guidelines, an organization should establish
    dedicated AI governance teams or functions to help streamline the governance processes
    for faster AI solution delivery. This team would be responsible for developing
    and enforcing standards, policies, and best practices to ensure the ethical and
    responsible use of AI across the enterprise, and they would support the internal
    functional and project teams to assess risks, implement appropriate controls,
    and maintain compliance with relevant regulations and industry guidelines.

    Integrating ML models into the business requires a significant amount of effort
    and investment– sometimes even more than the initial efforts of identifying ML
    use cases and implementing the ML models and infrastructure. This is because integrating
    ML models into the business process requires changes to the way the business operates,
    as well as investment in communication, training, and onboarding.

    everyone in the organization understands the changes and is on the same page.
    Communication is critical, and it is important to keep all stakeholders informed
    and engaged throughout the process. This includes not only the technical teams
    responsible for building the models but also business stakeholders who will be
    affected by the changes.

    capabilities. This involves identifying where ML can be integrated most effectively,
    rethinking existing business processes, and identifying new workflows that take
    advantage of the new capabilities. For example, if you have developed ML models
    to identify customers with high cross-sell and upsell potential, you need to implement
    the required business process changes to act on these insights, such as building
    outbound engagement teams or mechanisms to reach out to these customers.

    implement the ML solution but also take action and make decisions based on the
    insights provided by these systems. For instance, if an organization has implemented
    a credit decision system that automatically scores users’ eligibility for loans,
    but continues to rely on humans to make the final decision for the majority of
    cases, the value of the ML system will be diminished. This undermines the potential
    for the sustained adoption of ML across the organization. Therefore, it is crucial
    for organizations to trust and utilize the insights provided by ML solutions to
    fully realize the benefits of the technology.

    users and teams are able to ramp up on the new ML capabilities and workflows.
    This includes not only technical training for those responsible for using and
    maintaining the models but also training for business stakeholders who may not
    have technical expertise but will be using the models in their day-to-day work.

    You were introduced to the assessment of ML adoption maturity through a set of
    questions aimed at identifying key areas for developing AI/ML maturity. We also
    discussed the best practices in establishing an AI/ML vision, initiating an AI/ML
    initiative, and scaling your AI/ML adoption across different ML use cases, ML
    infrastructure, and ML governance.
