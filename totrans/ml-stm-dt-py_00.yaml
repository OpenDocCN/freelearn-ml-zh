- en: Streaming data is the new top technology to watch in the field of data science
    and machine learning. As business needs become more demanding, many use cases
    require real-time analysis as well as real-time machine learning. This book will
    allow you to get up to speed with data analytics for streaming data and focuses
    strongly on adapting machine learning and other analytics to the case of streaming
    data.

- en: You will first learn about the architecture for streaming and real-time machine
    learning. You will then look at the state-of-the-art frameworks for streaming
    data such as River.

- en: You will learn about various industrial use cases for streaming data, such as
    online anomaly detection. Then, you will deep dive into challenges and how you
    will mitigate them. You will then learn the best practices that will help you
    use streaming data to generate real-time insights.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists and machine learning engineers who have a basis in machine learning,
    are practice- and technology-oriented, and want to learn how to apply machine
    learning to streaming data through practical examples with modern technologies
    will benefit from this book. You will need to understand basic Python and machine
    learning concepts but require no prior knowledge of streaming.
