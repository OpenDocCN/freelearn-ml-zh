    for thousands of years, and it’s still a hot topic! Predicting the future helps
    to identify and exploit opportunities, optimize resource allocation, and prepare
    better for catastrophes, disasters, and crises. Predictive analytics is a subfield
    of data analysis that aims to utilize historical data to predict or forecast the
    future. Now, to embark on our journey of understanding predictive analytics, let’s
    examine some of its interesting applications.

    to concentrate their resources and attention and allocate their advertising efforts
    effectively toward a specific customer segment. Additionally, it helps companies
    to create personalized advertisements, products, and services. Thus, they can
    attract more customers, optimize their resources, and consequently achieve higher
    profits. For example, *Starbucks* leverages your purchase history to suggest new
    drinks that you may like. For more information, refer to *How Starbucks Uses Predictive
    Analytics and Your Loyalty Card* *Data* ([https://demand-planning.com/2018/05/29/how-starbucks-uses-predictive-analytics-and-your-loyalty-card-data](https://demand-planning.com/2018/05/29/how-starbucks-uses-predictive-analytics-and-your-loyalty-card-data)).

    usually aim to find the ideal price that will achieve the highest profitability.
    There is often a trade-off between low prices but more customers and high prices
    but fewer customers. Thus, companies utilize predictive analytics and ML to take
    into consideration market situations, such as demand, competitors’ prices, and
    item qualities and quantities for optimal price predictions. For more information
    about pricing optimization, refer to *Pricing Optimization & Machine Learning*

    The historical data of previous risk incidents and fraudulent activities can be
    leveraged to train ML models to predict possible attacks, threats, and risks in
    the future. *PayPal*, *Apple Pay*, and *Amazon Pay* continuously assess customers’
    behavior to identify any suspicious activities or abnormal patterns. This includes
    unusual spending patterns, many failed authentication attempts, and rapid account
    or customer information changes. The ML models are usually trained on customers’
    relevant data, such as transaction patterns, device information, and customers’
    locations. For more information, refer to *4 Ways Machine Learning Helps You Detect

- en: One of the main requirements of predictive analytics models to work well in
    practice is the availability of large-scale historical data. In sectors such as
    healthcare, banking, security, and manufacturing, it is not easy to find such
    datasets. The main reasons behind that are privacy concerns, regulations, and
    trade secrets. As we know, without sufficient training datasets, ML algorithms
    simply cannot work well in practice. Thus, predictive analytics methods based
    on real data work well only in certain fields where data is available. Therefore,
    augmenting real data with synthetic data can complement small-sized and incomplete
    real datasets. Thus, it solves one of the main issues of real datasets in these
    fields, as we will see in the next section.

    is often not evenly distributed. Thus, predictive models become biased, which
    leads to wrong decisions and predictions. Using synthetic data, you can make your
    dataset balanced by generating samples for classes or categories with fewer samples.
    This positively impacts your predictive model performance and, thus, improves
    the decision-making procedure of your company.

    process, companies must update their data continuously to accurately capture and
    present the real market. Thus, using real data may cost the company more and yet
    cause ML models to make predictions based on outdated data. Additionally, as mentioned,
    companies need to continuously collect and annotate real data, which is indeed
    a cumbersome process. Synthetic data can be generated quickly and efficiently
    to augment real data. Thus, it presents a cheap and high-quality solution for
    predictive analytics problems.

    issues with the usability of real insurance data because of the many regulations
    that limit the usability of sensitive data for predictive analytics in a rapidly
    changing market, such as the insurance market. At the same time, they wanted to
    improve their services and the offers they make to their customers. To address
    these issues, they investigated using synthetic data and, indeed, trained their
    ML models using the generated synthetic data. The predictive analytics synthetic
    data-based system, called “Next Best Offer,” achieved amazing results, which helped
    the company to better understand and support customers. Leveraging synthetic data,
    they were able to train their model on a large-scale dataset of 1 million customers,
    including 380 features. The dataset included sensitive information about customers
    such as addresses, payment histories, and insurance claims. They emphasized that
    using synthetic data helped their company to test their hypothesis without violating
    customers’ privacy. Synthetic data reduced the time required to handle privacy
    issues. They concluded that using synthetic data-based predictive analytics was

    for specific types of blood cancer. Usually, the decision of which patients are
    eligible and can better benefit from this treatment is decided by a dedicated
    panel (see [https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/cdf/car-t-therapy](https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/cdf/car-t-therapy)).
    ML models and predictive analytics are utilized to make accurate predictions for
    this task. However, with the limited amount of available real data, the task is
    complex for ML models. As expected, a slight improvement in the accuracy of such
    models means more lives to save and less cost to spend. Thus, it is still a hot
    research topic that requires more work.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this particular case study, the task is a binary classification problem –
    eligible or ineligible to receive CAR-T treatment. The main issue here, in addition
    to data scarcity, is an imbalanced data distribution, where one class has much
    more training samples compared to the other, which causes the ML models to give
    biased predictions. Using synthetic data to augment real data was an ideal solution
    to make the training dataset balanced. This is achieved by generating synthetic
    samples for the class with less training data.

    for predictive analytics specifically for fraud transactions. In addition to bias
    and imbalance issues with real datasets, they did not include sufficient training
    samples under rare events. This caused ML models to be less accurate in these
    scenarios. To address these issues, they utilized **WGAN-GP**, which we discussed
    in [*Chapter 7*](B18494_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120). They leveraged WGAN-GP to
    learn real data. Then, they used this generative model to generate samples to
    make the dataset balanced and include rare fraudulent activities. This supplemented
    the training dataset and directly improved the robustness and generalizability
    of the ML model under standard and challenging scenarios, where no sufficient
    real training data was available. For more information, refer to *Augment fraud
