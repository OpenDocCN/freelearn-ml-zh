    (**ML**) life cycle, the difficult and time-consuming stages of ML, and how far
    we are from an ideal world. In this chapter, we'll explore one area of ML, which
    is ML feature management. ML feature management is the process of creating features,
    storing them in persistent storage, and serving them at scale for model training
    and inference. It is one of the most important stages of ML, although it is often
    overlooked. In data science/engineering teams in the early stages of ML, the absence
    of feature management has been a major hindrance to getting their ML models to
    production.

    be using S3 buckets to store features, whereas other data scientists in the team
    might be using transactional databases. One may be more comfortable using CSV
    files and the other might prefer using Avro or Parquet files. Due to personal
    preference and a lack of standardization, each model will probably have a different
    way of managing features. Good feature management, on the other hand, should do

    features are needed in production. Let's go through an example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We often use taxi and food delivery services. One of the good things about these
    services is that they tell us how long it will take for our taxi or food to arrive. Also,
    most of the time, it is approximately correct. How does it predict this accurately?
    It uses ML, of course. The ML model predicts how long it will take for the taxi
    or food to arrive. For a model like that to be successful, not only does it need
    a good feature engineering and ML algorithm, but also the most recent features.
    Though we don't know the exact feature set that the model uses, let's look at
    a couple of features that change dynamically and are very important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With food delivery services, the major components that affect the delivery time
    are restaurants, drivers, traffic, and customers. The model probably uses a set
    of slow-changing features that are updated regularly, maybe daily or weekly, and
    a set of dynamic features that change every few minutes. The slow-changing features
    might include the average number of orders a restaurant receives at different
    times of the day from the app and in person, the average time it takes for an
    order to be ready, and so on. It might seem like these features are not slow-changing,
    but if you think about it, the average number of orders might differ based on
    restaurant location, seasonality, time of the day, day of the week, and more.
    Dynamic features include how long the last five orders took, the number of cancelations
    in the past 30 minutes, and the current number of orders for the restaurant. Similarly,
    driver features might include average order delivery time with respect to distance,
    how often the driver cancels orders, and whether the driver is picking up multiple
    orders. Apart from these features, there will be traffic features, which change
    much more dynamically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With many dynamic features in play, even if one of them is an hour old, the
    model's predictions will go off the charts. For example, if there is a crash on
    the delivery route and traffic features don't capture it and use it for inference,
    the model will predict that food will arrive more quickly than it actually will.
    Similarly, if the model cannot get the current number of orders at the restaurant,
    it will use the old value and predict a value that may be far from the truth.
    Hence the more up-to-date features a model gets, the better the predictions will
    be. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that the app will not give the features;
    the app can only give information such as the restaurant ID and the customer ID.
    The model will have to fetch the features and facts from a different location,
    ideally a feature store. Wherever the features are being fetched from, the infrastructure
    serving it must scale in and scale out based on traffic to efficiently use resources
    and also to accommodate requests at low latency with a very low percentage of
    errors, if any.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like the food delivery service, the model we built in the first chapter
    needs the features during inference and the more up to date the features are,
    the better the customer's **lifetime value** (**LTV**) prediction will be. Good
    predictions will lead to better actions, resulting in excellent customer experience,
    hence better customer affinity, and better business.

    daily, weekly, and so on. Two of the common batch models are forecasting and customer
    segmentation. Batch inference is easier and less complex than its counterpart
    since it doesn''t have any latency requirements; inference can run for minutes
    or hours. Batch models can use distributed computational frameworks such as Spark.
    Also, they can be run with simple infrastructure. Most ML models start as batch
    models and, over time, depending on the available infrastructure and requirements,
    they go on to become online/transactional models.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have drawbacks, such as the predictions not always being up to date. Since there
    is a time lag on predictions, it might cost business. For example, let's say a
    manufacturing plant uses order forecasting models to acquire raw materials. Depending
    on the time lag of the batch forecast models, the business might need to bear
    the cost of the shortage in raw materials versus overstocking raw materials in
    the warehouse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    prediction will be generated on demand. Online models take advantage of the current
    reality and use that for predictions. Online models are transactional, need low-latency
    serving, and should scale based on incoming traffic. A typical online model is
    a recommendation model, which could be product recommendation, design recommendation,
    and so on.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though real-time prediction sounds fancy, online models face a different set
    of challenges. It is easier to build applications whose latency is 8 hours than
    it is to build an application with a latency of 100 milliseconds. The latency
    of online models is usually in milliseconds. That means the model has a few milliseconds
    to figure out what the most up-to-date value is (which means generating or getting
    the latest features for the model) and predict the outcomes. For this to happen,
    the model needs a supporting infrastructure to serve the data required for prediction.
    Online models are usually hosted as REST API endpoints, which again need scaling,
    monitoring, and more.

    of the Machine Learning Life Cycle*, once the model development is complete and
    it's ready for productionization, the notebook will be refactored to remove unwanted
    code. Some data engineers also break down a single notebook into multiple logical
    steps, such as feature engineering, model training, and model prediction. The
    refactored notebooks or refactored Python scripts generated from the notebook
    are scheduled using an orchestration framework such as Airflow. In a typical pipeline,
    the first stage will read the raw data from different data sources, perform data
    cleaning, and carry out feature engineering, which will be used by subsequent
    stages in the pipeline. Once the model prediction stage is complete, the prediction
    output will be written to a persistent store, maybe a database or an S3 bucket.
    The results will be accessed from the persistent storage as and when needed. If
    a stage in the pipeline fails for any reason (such as a data accessibility issue
    or errors in the code), the pipeline will be set up to trigger an alarm and stop
    further execution.

    generated when the pipeline runs. In some cases, it also retrains a new model
    with the latest data, and in others, it uses a previously trained model and predicts
    using the features generated from the data available at the time when the pipeline
    is run. As you can see in *Figure 2.1*, every new model that is built starts at
    the raw data source, repeats the same steps, and joins the production pipeline
    list. We will discuss the problems in this approach in the later section. Let's

    different standards that teams follow depending on the tools they use. Some might
    use packing libraries such as MLflow, joblib, or ONNX. Others might package the
    model directly as the REST API Docker image. As data scientists and data engineers
    have a different set of skills, as mentioned in *Figure 1.1* of [*Chapter 1*](B18024_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014)*,
    An Overview of the Machine Learning Life Cycle*, the ideal approach is to provide
    data scientists with tools to package models using libraries such as MLflow, joblib,
    and ONNX, and save the model to a model registry. The data engineers can then
    use the registered model to build REST APIs and deploy it. There is also out-of-the-box
    support to deploy MLflow-packaged models as AWS SageMaker endpoints with a simple
    **command-line interface** (**CLI**) command. It also supports building REST API
    Docker images with a CLI command, which then can be deployed in any container
    environment.

    required dependencies for the ML library. Packaging models with built-in flavors

    and load it in the `predict` method of the model. Though this might sound like
    an easy deployment option, the result of this is not far away from a batch model.
    Since features are packaged along with the model, they are static. Any change
    in the raw dataset will not affect the model unless a new version of the model
    is built with a new set of features generated from the latest data and packaged
    along with the model. However, this might be a good first step from batch to online
    models. The reason I say this is that instead of running it as a batch model,
    you have now made it a pull-based inference. Also, you have defined a REST endpoint
    input and output format for the consumer of the model. The only pending step is
    to get the latest features to the model instead of static features, which are
    packaged. Once that is implemented, the consumers of the model won't have to make
    any changes and consumers will be served with predictions using the latest available
    data.

    skill sets, different levels of experience with the available tools, and different
    preferences. Also, data engineers on two different teams rarely have the same

    other part of this problem is even bigger. That is re-calculation across the teams
    and domains. Just like in the *Re-inventing the wheel* section, where teams were
    trying to figure out how to bring ML features to production, data scientists are
    re-discovering the data and features themselves here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the major drivers of this is a lack of trust and discoverability. Let's
    talk about discoverability first. Whenever data scientists work on a model and
    do a great job of data mining, exploration, and feature engineering, there are
    very limited ways of sharing it, as we discussed in the first chapter. The data
    scientist can use emails and presentations to do that. However, there is no way
    for anybody to discover what's available and selectively build what is not and
    use both in the model. Even if it's possible to discover other data scientists
    work, it is not possible to use it without figuring out data access and re-calculating
    features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other driver for re-inventing the wheel in data discovery and feature engineering
    is trust. Though evidence is clear that there is a production model that uses
    the generated features, data scientists often find it difficult to trust programs
    developed by others that generate the features. Since raw data is trustworthy
    as it will have SLAs and schema validations, data scientists often end up re-discovering
    and generating the features.
  prefs: []

    generated by others discoverable, sharable, and, most importantly, trustworthy,

    the feature engineering code used to generate the features for model training
    is different from the code used to generate the features for model prediction/serving.
    This could happen for many reasons; for instance, during model training, the data
    scientist may have used PySpark for generating the features, where as while productionizing
    the pipeline, the ML/Data engineer who took over, used a different technologies
    that is required by the production infrastructure. There are few problems with
    this. One is, there are two versions of feature engineering code, and the other
    problem is this could cause the training versus serving skew since the data generated
    by two versions of the pipeline may not be same for the same raw data input.

    the story of how after a data scientist quit his job, the model he was working
    on was lost and his team couldn't reproduce the model many times. One of the main
    reasons for this is again the lack of feature management tools. You might ask
    what the problem is in reproducing the same model when you have the history of
    raw data. Let's take a look.

    production. But Ram was not challenged enough in this job, so he quit and moved
    on to a different firm. Unfortunately, the production system went down, Ram didn't
    follow the MLOps standards of saving the model to a registry, so the model was
    lost and could not be recovered.

    is one of the crucial aspects of ML, we need to time travel. This means that data

    feature serving. The ability to provide features at low latency decides whether
    a model can be hosted as an online model or a batch model. This has problems such
    as building and managing infrastructure and keeping features up to date. As it
    doesn't make sense to set up all models to be transactional, at the same time
    there is a high chance that a feature used in one batch model could be of great
    use in a different online model. So, the ability to switch the low-latency serving
    on and off would be a great benefit to data scientists.

    it turns out, the answer is *yes*, there is one tool that can solve all the problems
    we have talked about so far. It is called a *feature store*. In the next section,

    store** is an operational data system for managing and serving ML features to
    models in production. It can serve feature data to models from a low-latency online
    store (for real-time prediction) or from an offline store (for scale-out batch
    scoring or model training). As the definition points out, it''s a whole package
    that helps you create and manage ML features, and accelerate the operationalization
    of models. Before we dive deeper into feature stores, let''s look at how the architecture
    of ML pipelines changes with the introduction of a feature store:'

    store. Yes, it might seem that way, but there is more to it. Unlike a traditional
    data store, a feature store has a special set of capabilities; it is not a data
    store, but rather a data system (as its definition states), and it can do much
    more than just storage and retrieval.'

    stages in ML.

    in the feature store, the data scientist will discover the data of interest and

    that the data scientist is working on and for other data scientists who find these
    features useful in their model.

    different ways of reading data and building feature engineering pipelines, but
    beyond feature engineering, the rest of the pipeline becomes a standard implementation.
    The ML engineers and data scientists don't have to come up with new ways to bring
    features to production. After feature engineering, the data scientists and ML
    engineers will ingest the features into the feature store. The feature store,
    by definition, can serve features at low latency. All ML engineers will have to
    do after that is update their `predict` method to fetch the required features
    from the feature store and return the predictions. This not only makes the life
    of the ML engineers easy, it sometimes also offloads managing feature management
    infrastructure.

    the features that were used to build the customer LTV model. The data scientist
    can connect to the feature store, which is being updated with the latest features
    of the previous model, and get the features required to train the new model. However,
    the data scientist will have to build a data cleaning and feature engineering
    pipeline for the additional features that they find useful from the raw data.

    Feature stores help data scientists achieve that. The other major issue was re-calculating
    and re-discovering useful data and features across teams due to the lack of feature
    discoverability. Guess what? Feature stores solve that too. Data scientists can
    connect to a feature store and browse through the existing feature tables and
    schemas. If they find any of the existing features useful, data scientists can
    use them in the model without re-discovering or re-calculating them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem involved in sharing was trust. Although feature stores don't
    solve this completely, they address it to some extent. Since the feature tables
    are created and managed by a team, the data scientists can always reach out to
    the owners to get access and also discuss other aspects, such as SLAs and monitoring.
    If you haven't noticed yet, feature stores facilitate collaboration between teams.
    This can be beneficial for both teams, with data scientists and ML engineers from
    different teams working together and sharing each other's expertise.

    feature engineering is complete, the features will be ingested into the feature
    store and feature store is the source for model training. Hence, the data scientists
    will use the features in feature store to train the ML model. Once the model is
    trained and moved to production, the production model will fetch the online store
    or historical store again for model prediction. As these features are used by
    both - training and prediction, serving is generated by the same pipeline/code
    and we will never have this issue with feature store.

    was to go back in time and fetch the same state data that produced the old model.

    stores. However, it is possible to store generated features in such a way that
    it allows data scientists to time travel.'

    store, which stores historical data and allows users to go back in time and get
    the value of a feature at a specific point in time. With a feature store, a data
    scientist can get features from a specific time in history, so reproducing the
    model consistently is possible. Model reproducibility is no longer an issue with

    the ideal way to accelerate ML. Let's start with a real-world example as we are

    Although there are a lot of comparisons on the internet, we chose the one that

    buying a home, we try to use expert opinion to make a decision. If you look at
    it in a certain way, these are features in our decision-making. Along with the
    expert's opinion, we also include our own constraints and features, such as budget,
    memory if it's a phone, the number of seats if it's a car, and the number of rooms
    if it's a house. We use a combination of these to decide and take action. In most
    cases, this approach works, and in some cases, we might do a lot more research
    and become experts too.

    it is like Google for data scientists. Instead of a generic search like Google,
    data scientists are looking for something specific, and are also sharing their
    expertise with other data scientists. If what is available in the feature store
    doesn't work for a data scientist, they will go to raw data, explore, understand,
    become experts in it, and come up with distinguishing features about a particular
    entity, which could be products, customers, and so on. This workflow of ML with
    feature stores will not only help data scientists use each other's expertise but
    also standardize and accelerate ML development.
