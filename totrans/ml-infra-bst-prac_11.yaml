- en: Although machine learning and its cousin artificial intelligence are well known,
    they refer to a wide range of algorithms and models. First, there are the classical
    machine learning models that are based on statistical learning and usually require
    the data to be prepared in a tabular form. They identify patterns in the data
    and can replicate these patterns. However, there are also modern models that are
    based on deep learning, which are capable of capturing more fine-grained patterns
    in data that is less structured. The crown examples of these models are the transformer
    models (GPT) and autoencoders (diffusers). In this part of the book, we take a
    closer look at these models. We focus on how these models can be trained and integrated
    into machine learning pipelines. We also look into how software engineering practices
    should be applied to these models.
