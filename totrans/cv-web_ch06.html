<p>You have done a lot so far. Starting from basic math operations to complex filters and object tracking, we reviewed the most popular and most multifunctional libraries on Computer Vision, which are available in the JavaScript world. There are a lot of topics in Computer Vision and image processing, which we did not touch in this book. Here, we will try to provide an idea where you can go next.</p>
<p>First, we will summarize the topics in Computer Vision, which you have already learned. Then, we will discuss why it is so important to use JavaScript in some cases.</p>
<p>Next, we will introduce several JavaScript libraries, which were not covered in the previous chapters. Many of them provide improvements in algorithms and extend applications of Computer Vision in the Web.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>

<p>In this book, we have applied different image processing and Computer Vision techniques to images and videos. Starting from fundamental math operations, we saw how basic math can be used for different applications and how it is important to know mathematics to understand the basics of image processing. Those operations were extended to provide a clear means of image filtering. The main concept here was the image convolution when a transformation was applied for each image pixel. Then, we followed the path of object detection. We <a id="id263" class="indexterm"></a>even created our own object detector! The face detection and tracking algorithms showed us that these types of methods can be applied to create a human interface. We saw an example of this in the previous chapter (cube rotation with a head). One of the most exciting methods is optical flow, with the help of which you can easily track objects and create complex programs that are controlled by gestures. Let's have a small exercise. In the following image, you can see that we applied different Computer Vision and image processing methods on an image:</p>
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00138.jpeg" alt="Refresh your memory"/><div class="caption"><p>The original image is in color, you can find it in the provided image bundle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p>
<p>The preceding image is divided into eight parts, and we have applied different algorithms on them. The first part is the original part of an image. The second is the converted into grayscale. Try to guess other ones, we have learnt all of them during the course of the book. If you want to check yourself, look at the answer at the end of this section.</p>

<div class="section" title="Importance of client-side scripting" id="aid-1565U1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec37"></a>Importance of client-side scripting</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, why do we use JavaScript? We have already addressed this in the preface. Now, you can probably answer it by yourself.</p>
<p>When it comes to practical <a id="id264" class="indexterm"></a>Computer Vision, many people mention the OpenCV library (<a class="ulink" href="http://opencv.org">http://opencv.org</a>). Yes, it does provide the outstanding functionality for people who do not know much about Computer Vision. Unfortunately, it is written in C++ and does not provide an interface for JavaScript. And if it does, a user needs to install the OpenCV package on their computer, which is not good for the end user, as they would want to use your websites without installing anything.</p>
<p>If you just install <a id="id265" class="indexterm"></a>the backend library on your side and do the whole computation on your servers, then you will need a ton of clusters to support your website. Even a small portion of Computer Vision algorithms can slow down computer performance significantly. This is probably why you will prefer to use the client-side scripting.</p>
<p>It is now time for JavaScript to show its full potential. Using it, we kill two birds with one stone. Note that:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">There is no need anymore for a user to install anything but a browser (which is usually already installed) on their computer</li>
<li class="listitem">JavaScript runs directly on the end user machine, so you do not need to use expensive equipment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>There are already many Computer Vision algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Unfortunately, not as many as in OpenCV, for example. But you can already use the JavaScript libraries and even extend them! We think that you are prepared enough to extend current boundaries of Computer Vision in the JavaScript world.</p>
<p>Here are the answers for the image earlier in this section. The relevant chapter number is written in brackets after each answer. After the grayscale part of the image (1) the answers for image parts from left to right are: histogram equalization (2), blur (Gaussian Blur) (2), Sobel Filter (2), Canny Edge detection (2), feature extraction (FAST features) (3), and finally color object detection (3).</p>

<div class="section" title="Other interesting libraries in Computer Vision" id="aid-164MG1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec38"></a>Other interesting libraries in Computer Vision</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We already saw a lot of <a id="id266" class="indexterm"></a>Computer Vision JavaScript libraries, but there are many of them which we did not discuss in the book. Some of those libraries are focused on face and face particle detection, others are a bit more general and implement several object detection techniques.</p>
<div class="section" title="CCV library and its extensions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec42"></a>CCV library and its extensions</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Face detection is <a id="id267" class="indexterm"></a>probably the <a id="id268" class="indexterm"></a>most popular task in web applications. One of the original libraries, which <a id="id269" class="indexterm"></a>provide face detection is the <a id="id270" class="indexterm"></a>CCV library (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">https://github.com/liuliu/ccv</a>). The main part of the library consists of C functions, but there are JavaScript parts that are responsible for the face detection. There are a lot of libraries which base their face detection on it, for example:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://facedetection.jaysalvat.com">http://facedetection.jaysalvat.com</a>: This is the jQuery library with an easy-to-follow installation guide and API.</li>
<li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection">https://github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection</a>: This library is very easy to use; it detects a face using only the <code class="literal">App.start()</code> command.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Face detection and more"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec43"></a>Face detection and more</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are libraries<a id="id271" class="indexterm"></a> that tend to <a id="id272" class="indexterm"></a>provide face detection extensions. Some of them use libraries that are already discussed in this<a id="id273" class="indexterm"></a> book, for example, the JSFeat library (<a class="ulink" href="http://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/">http://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/</a>).</p>
<p>We start from the <a id="id274" class="indexterm"></a>Camgaze library (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/wallarelvo/camgaze.js">https://github.com/wallarelvo/camgaze.js</a>). Its primary focus is <a id="id275" class="indexterm"></a>eyes detection and gaze prediction.</p>
<p>Another wonderful library is CLMtrackr (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr">https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr</a>). It is an exceptional library<a id="id276" class="indexterm"></a> for fitting<a id="id277" class="indexterm"></a> facial models to a face on a video or an image. To understand this better, look at the following image:</p>
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00139.jpeg" alt="Face detection and more"/></div>
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p>
<p>The library tries to<a id="id278" class="indexterm"></a> fit the facial model point-by-point. With the help of this model, you can precisely track a <a id="id279" class="indexterm"></a>face or recognize emotions. The author provides a couple of examples where you can perform these tasks. In addition to this, there are examples of face deformation and face masking. For a basic explanation of how this is done, you can follow an excellent overview of that library, which is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://auduno.com/post/61888277175/fitting-faces">http://auduno.com/post/61888277175/fitting-faces</a>.</p>

<div class="section" title="Object detection with js-objectdetect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec44"></a>Object detection with js-objectdetect</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will introduce <a id="id280" class="indexterm"></a>one more library<a id="id281" class="indexterm"></a> here. It is js-objectdetect (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect">https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect</a>), which is <a id="id282" class="indexterm"></a>an excellent library. You may ask, why is that? It provides a lot <a id="id283" class="indexterm"></a>of trained Haar classifiers, so you can play with them a bit more. In addition to face, eye, and mouth detectors, it contains classifiers for smile, body (full and upper), hands (open and fist), nose, and profile face.</p>
<p>Not all classifiers in the library have the same performance, many of them are sensitive for lighting conditions and noise. But they are totally worth a try!</p>
