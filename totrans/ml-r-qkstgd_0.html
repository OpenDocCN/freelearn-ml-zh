<p class="mce-root">This book provides practical guidelines on how to use machine learning algorithms to create predictive models. It is very common to learn about machine learning in tutorials using <em>toy</em>, or small, datasets, which is very practical for learning the basic concepts but not enough when trying to apply what you've learned to real problems. </p>
<p>This book covers the main steps to be followed in order to develop predictive models based on machine learning algorithms. Data collection, data treatment, univariate and multivariate analysis, and the application of the most common machine learning algorithms are some of the steps described in this book. <span>This is a programming book, </span><span>containing several lines of code, therefore you could replicate all the steps described in it. </span></p>
<p>This book shows how there are no unique modeling possibilities; different existing options in each modeling step are key to achieving accurate and useful models. </p>
<p><span>The applications included in this book have been based on the financial sector. This is mainly because I am familiar with the information and the problems, and because there is a huge amount of data to apply several techniques to in a way that is representative of problems that can be found in real life. </span></p>
<p>The theoretical framework of the book is based on explaining the financial crisis and its causes. Would we be able to predict the next financial crisis? If not, at least you will learn very useful techniques for squeezing your data.</p>

<p>This book is a useful textbook for graduate students and is a reference book for researchers and machine learning and big data practitioners who want to know how to deal with large amounts of data and the main problems that arise in both the development of predictive models and the application of machine learning algorithms. It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning and describes several key aspects of the application of algorithms. The book is focused on credit risk and the financial crisis, so it could also be interesting for researchers in that field.</p>

<p><a href="e0aa3017-a5c3-427b-b790-c881db030ff8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>R Fundamentals for Machine Learning</em>, introduces you to the problem that will be solved in this book and <span>covers the basics of getting and running R for the subsequent chapters.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="33b2f02e-58fd-41af-89a1-27947515b379.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Predicting Failures of Banks - Data Collection</em>, covers the main problems that arise when gathering data and how to structure data to obtain relevant features or variables to develop your first predictive model. </p>
<p><a href="dd701132-1627-482c-9b43-5196cc820a2a.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="dd701132-1627-482c-9b43-5196cc820a2a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Predicting Failures of Banks - Descriptive Analysis</em>, shows <span>how to observe and describe data, how to deal with highly unbalanced data, and also how to deal with missing values in variables.</span></p>
<p><a href="84355298-f702-47c5-b91d-c94e398fc841.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Predicting Failures of Banks - Univariate Analysis</em>, c<span>overs the analysis and measurement of the individual predictive power of variables and their relationship to the target variable. Additionally, as the number of variables is high, some techniques to reduce the number of variables are also included in this chapter.</span></p>
<p><a href="38bec534-d71b-41ca-aca7-3efb4667adc7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Predicting Failures of Banks - Multivariate Analysis</em>, demonstrates the implementation of di<span>fferent machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression, regularized methods, gradient boosting, neural networks, and <strong>Support Vector Machines</strong> (<strong>SVM</strong>) are briefly explained and implemented, to try to obtain an accurate model for predicting bank failures. This chapter also includes some basic guidelines on combining the results of different models to improve the accuracy of our model, and how to generate models in an automatic and visual way.</span></p>
<p><a href="5c1b431c-46f9-42b6-b3e7-e583b1996cd5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Visualizing Economic Problems in Countries</em>, co<span>vers the evolution of the financial crisis into a sovereign debt crisis, which shook even the foundations and solvency of the European Union. This chapter shows how macroeconomic imbalances in different countries can be measured. Specifically, this chapter will help you to understand clustering analysis, unsupervised models in nature, and how these techniques can help with even supervised problems.</span></p>
<p><a href="38b879ed-6686-45db-922a-031b5f5b85e3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Sovereign Crisis - NLP and Topic Modeling</em>, in<span>troduces the concept of text mining and topic extraction. This chapter shows that text mining can be very useful to collect information in qualitative reports.</span></p>

<p>This book is a programming book, therefore some previous experience in programming is desirable to get the most out of it. If you do happen to be an inexperienced programmer, <a href="e0aa3017-a5c3-427b-b790-c881db030ff8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>R Fundamentals for Machine Learning</em>, will provide you with a starting point for understanding R and how it works. Basics notions, concepts, and structures will be briefly explained.</p>
<p>This first chapter will not convert you into an expert in R, but provides you with key guidelines for following all of the code included in this book.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>We can create a list using </span><kbd>list()</kbd><span> or by concatenating other lists</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>n&lt;-10<br/>n<br/>## [1] 10</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>install.packages("ggplot2")</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Look for <span class="packt_screen">Download and I</span><span class="packt_screen"><span class="packt_screen">nstall</span> R</span> and select your operating system. We are installing for Windows, so select the <span class="packt_screen">Windows</span> link.</span><span>"</span></p>
