    <h1 class="chaptertitle" id="_idParaDest-29">Prompt Strategy</h1>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-30">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="normal">In the previous chapter, we gave some historical context to how AI has developed over the years, how we’ve gone from <strong class="screentext">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="screentext">NLP</strong>) to <strong class="screentext">large language models</strong> (<strong class="screentext">LLMs</strong>), and how the latter serves as the underlying machine learning model in AI assistants. To use these AI assistants, you use natural language prompts as input. However, to ensure you “prompt” in an efficient way, so that you get what you want, it’s important to have a strategy, and that’s what this chapter aims to give you.</p>
    <p class="normal1">How to “prompt” efficiently is commonly known in the industry as a “prompt strategy” or “prompt engineering.” It’s not an engineering practice in the common sense of the word but rather an art form where practitioners of AI assistants have discovered patterns and practices that seem to work well. We, the authors of this book, are building upon those discovered practices and aim to describe our findings for two domains: full-stack web development and data science. This book turns to you as either a web developer or data scientist and aims to empower you by describing how you can best approach problem solving in your domain using an AI assistant.</p>
    <p class="normal1">This chapter constitutes a central piece of the book. It’s central in the sense that the approach being taught will be exemplified by other chapters in the book. As such, see this chapter as a guide you can refer to, providing the theory and thinking that is used in future chapters that solve specific problems within data science and full-stack web development.</p>
    <p class="normal1">In this chapter, we will:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist">Provide a strategy for solving problems with prompts and validating the solution.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Illustrate the strategy with examples from data science and full-stack web development.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Identify some basic principles for writing prompts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-31">Where you are</h1>
    <p class="normal">As a reader and a practitioner of data science and/or full-stack web development, you know your craft. Knowing your craft means you know the tools and techniques to solve problems. At this point, you’re looking at an AI assistant and realize it’s controlled by natural language, so-called prompts. What you may not realize is that there’s more to it than just writing a prompt and getting an answer. An AI assistant is trained on a large corpus of text, so it’s quite flexible on what it can generate text on and how to respond to prompts. Because of this flexibility, it’s important to understand how to write prompts that are effective and efficient.</p>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-32">Guidelines for how to prompt efficiently</h1>
    <p class="normal">Prompts <a id="_idIndexMarker028" class="calibre3"/>are input to AI tools. Depending on what you’re trying to achieve, you need to adjust your prompts for the scenario you’re solving for. Therefore, how you “prompt” matters. For example, if your prompt is too vague, you won’t get what you need. Or, let’s say you’re trying to use a prompt to generate company slogans; you don’t want to use the same prompt for generating code for an app. Conversely, in a discipline like data science, it’s important you perform tasks in a certain order and your prompt should reflect what you want done and, if needed, the steps to do so.</p>
    <p class="normal1">What you need to succeed is an approach, a strategy, that you can use in general to be efficient with AI assistants. Additionally, such a strategy should be specific enough to present “best practices” for chosen problem domains. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, we’ve developed a prompt strategy specifically for the domain’s full-stack web development and data science.</p>
    <p class="normal1">At a high level, we suggest the guidelines for general problem-solving using AI assistants; it’s our belief it holds true regardless of what problem domain you’re applying prompts to:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1"><strong class="screentext">Break down the problem</strong> so that it’s fully understood. Within this guideline, there might be several steps like the following:<ul class="calibre17">
          <li class="bulletlist2"><strong class="screentext">Understand the problem</strong>: For any problem, it’s important to understand what the problem is and what it’s not. For example, are we building a<a id="_idIndexMarker029" class="calibre3"/> machine learning model to predict sales or a web page to track inventory? These are two different problems and require different approaches.</li>
          <li class="bulletlist3"><strong class="screentext">Identify the parts</strong>: A problem is usually complex and consists of many parts that need to be solved. For example, if we’re building a machine learning model to predict sales, we need to identify the data, the model, the training, and the evaluation. Each of these parts can be broken down into smaller parts and so on. Once you find the right detail level for your problem, you can start solving it by writing prompts.</li>
          <li class="bulletlist3"><strong class="screentext">Break down the problem into smaller pieces</strong>: If needed, break down your problem into smaller more manageable pieces.</li>
          <li class="bulletlist3"><strong class="screentext">Identify and understand the data</strong>: Especially with machine learning, it’s crucial to identify a dataset to work with, what it contains, and how it’s structured. Within web development, data also plays a central role, but the goal is usually to ensure you can read, write, and present data in a way that’s useful for the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Generate prompts</strong> at a suitable level. Once you’ve understood the problem fully, you should have a list of tasks, and for each task, you should be able to author and run a prompt that solves said task.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Validate the solution</strong>. Just like without AI assistants, validation plays a crucial part in building systems or apps. Traditionally, that means writing tests, testing various components together, and letting users try out various parts. Using prompts is no different. A side effect of LLMs is that they can generate text that’s not relevant to the problem or solve the problem in a less-than-optimal way. Because you’re relying on prompts that end up generating code for you, it becomes extra important to validate the solution to ensure it is correct and relevant.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1">In the upcoming sections, we will describe a detailed strategy for each chosen problem domain’s full-stack web development and data science.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-33">Prompt techniques</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are some techniques that are extra useful when instructing the AI assistant to ensure you get the most out of it. The general advice is to provide enough context to the AI assistant but what that means exactly can be made more concrete via the below suggested patterns:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist">Task-Action-Guideline Prompt Pattern</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Persona-Instruction-Content Prompt Pattern </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Exploratory prompt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="heading2" id="_idParaDest-34">Task-Action-Guideline prompt pattern (TAG)</h3>
    <p class="normal">To explain how this pattern works, let’s break down the parts and the show an example prompt with an example response:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Intent</strong>: To instruct an AI assistant on what task to solve, what actions to take, and what guidelines to adhere to.</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Task</strong>: Clearly define the task you want the AI to accomplish</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Action</strong>: Specify the steps or actions the AI should take to complete the task</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Guideline</strong>: Provide any rules, constraints, or guidelines the AI should follow while performing the task</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">Example:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Task: Generate a summary of the latest news article about climate change.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Action: </p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Search for the most recent news articles on climate change.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Select the article with the highest relevance and credibility.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Summarize the key points of the article in 3-4 sentences.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1">Guideline:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Ensure the summary is concise and accurate.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Avoid using technical jargon; keep the language simple and accessible.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Cite the source of the article at the end of the summary.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt response]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Summary: A recent article from BBC News highlights the alarming increase in global temperatures over the past decade. Scientists warn that if current trends continue, we could see unprecedented climate events. The article emphasizes the urgent need for international cooperation to combat climate change. [Source: BBC News]</p>
    <p class="normal1">This pattern helps ensure that the AI assistant understands the task, knows the steps to take, and adheres to any specific guidelines, leading to more accurate and useful outputs. </p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of response]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Here’s what a prompt example could look like for web development:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Task</strong>: Develop a RESTful API for a simple blog application using Node.js and Express.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Action</strong>:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Set up a new Node.js project.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Create an Express server.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Define routes for CRUD operations on blog posts.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Implement middleware for JSON parsing and error handling.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Write tests for the API endpoints.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Guideline</strong>:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Ensure the project setup is clear and straightforward.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Provide concise and accurate code examples.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Avoid using overly complex terminology; keep the language simple and accessible.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Include comments in the code to explain each step.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End prompt]</strong></p>
    <h3 class="heading2" id="_idParaDest-35">Persona-Instruction-Context prompt pattern (PIC)</h3>
    <p class="normal">Let’s describe this pattern in the same way as the preceding one, let’s define it, followed by an example prompt and an example response:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Intent</strong>: To instruct an AI assistant on the persona it should assume, what instructions to carry out, and provide enough context to generate a correct response.</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Persona</strong>: Define the persona or character traits the AI should embody while responding</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Instruction</strong>: Specify the tasks or actions the AI should perform</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Context</strong>: Provide relevant background information or context to help the AI understand the situation and generate an appropriate response</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">Example:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Persona: Assume the persona of a friendly and knowledgeable travel guide.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Instruction: </p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Recommend three must-visit attractions in Paris.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Provide a brief description of each attraction.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Suggest the best time to visit each attraction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1">Context: The user is planning a trip to Paris for the first time and is interested in both historical sites and local culture.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt response]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">As your friendly and knowledgeable travel guide, I’d love to recommend three must-visit attractions in Paris:</p>
    <p class="normal1">1. **Eiffel Tower**: This iconic landmark offers breathtaking views of the city. It’s best to visit in the early morning or late evening to avoid the crowds and enjoy the stunning sunrise or sunset.</p>
    <p class="normal1">2. **Louvre Museum**: Home to thousands of works of art, including the Mona Lisa, the Louvre is a treasure trove of history and culture. Plan your visit on a weekday morning to experience the museum with fewer visitors.</p>
    <p class="normal1">3. **Montmartre**: This charming neighborhood is known for its artistic history and vibrant street life. Visit in the late afternoon to explore the quaint streets and enjoy a leisurely dinner at a local café.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Enjoy your trip to Paris!</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of response]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">This pattern ensures that the AI assistant adopts the right persona, follows specific instructions, and uses the provided context to deliver a relevant and helpful response. </p>
    <p class="normal1">Here’s what such a prompt could like for web development:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Persona</strong>: Assume the persona of a friendly and knowledgeable software development mentor.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Instruction</strong>:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Set up a new Node.js project.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Create an Express server.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Define routes for CRUD operations on blog posts.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Implement middleware for JSON parsing and error handling.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Write tests for the API endpoints.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">Context</strong>: The user is a beginner in web development and is looking to build their first RESTful API for a blog application. They need clear, step-by-step guidance and code examples.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <h3 class="heading2" id="_idParaDest-36">Exploratory prompt pattern</h3>
    <p class="normal">You might find yourself in situations where you’re not building a project from start to finish, or you only want to build a smaller part of and then evaluate the response. In those cases, your prompts will be more exploratory in nature and can for example look like the below:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Clean the data.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">An assumption here is that we have a Notebook open with existing code that has already fetched the data. </p>
    <p class="normal1">Or, something more for web development:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Add CSS for this product list.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Prompts for this pattern are usually a lot shorter in length, has context (derived from existing code or in some other way) and the developer line of sight is seldom beyond the next step.</p>
    <h3 class="heading2" id="_idParaDest-37">Learn-Improvise-Feedback-Evaluate prompt pattern (LIFE)</h3>
    <p class="normal">This pattern, like TAG and PIC helps frame the problem and provides a good start to a solution that you can further refine.</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Learn</strong>: Highlight the need to understand data through various analytical techniques, from basic statistics to complex correlations and temporal analysis.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Improvise</strong>: Adapt the analysis based on initial findings. For instance, if certain categories of products show unusual trends, deepen the analysis in these areas </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Feedback</strong>: <ul class="calibre17">
          <li class="bulletlist2">Share code and model outputs for feedback to ensure effective learning and understanding.</li>
          <li class="bulletlist3">Incorporate suggestions and critiques to refine the model and the approach.</li>
          <li class="bulletlist3">Provide errors to troubleshoot and resolve the issues</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Evaluate: </strong>Execute the code provided by ChatGPT to ensure accuracy and validity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">An example prompt from this pattern might look like so:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Project Title: Building a Web-Based Search Results Page. You must suggest steps and code</p>
    <p class="normal1">Objective: Create a dynamic and interactive search results page that efficiently displays and filters search results based on user queries. Steps: </p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Learn</strong>: Understand the importance of displaying search results effectively. Analyze user interaction data to identify key metrics such as click-through rates, average time spent on results pages, and user satisfaction scores.

      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Improvise</strong>: Based on initial findings, adapt the search results page to highlight the most relevant results. For instance, if users frequently click on certain types of results, prioritize these in the display. Implement features such as filters, sorting options, and pagination to enhance user experience. </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Feedback</strong>: Share your code and the search results page with peers or mentors for feedback. This will help ensure effective learning and understanding. Incorporate their suggestions and critiques to refine the search results page and improve its functionality. Provide errors: Document any errors encountered during the development process, such as issues with data retrieval or display. Troubleshoot and resolve these issues, learning from the process to enhance your skills. </li>

    <h3 class="heading2" id="_idParaDest-38">Which pattern to choose?</h3>
    <p class="normal">The general answer it depends on the situation which pattern to choose. The reason for choosing between the TAG and PIC is that you have a clearly defined problem that you want to solve from start to finish and you’re looking for the AI assistant to do the “heavy lifting”. The reason to go for the exploratory pattern is when you’re working on an existing codebase, or you want to try out various approaches and steps. Our general recommendation is to try out all three patterns to see what suits your approach and problem the best.</p>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-39">Prompt strategy for web development</h1>
    <p class="normal">Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker030" class="calibre3"/> apply the different guidelines presented in the former section, and through using these guidelines, we will step by step work ourselves toward a prompt strategy.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-40">Break down the problem: “web system for inventory management”</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let’s use a real example, “inventory management” within web development, to see if we can understand the general problem. To “manage” an inventory, you need to read and write data <a id="_idIndexMarker031" class="calibre3"/>to it. Most likely, you will have different roles in this system/app, everything from administrators to normal users. You might also need to consider how this system fits in with other systems, should you, for example, integrate it with other systems, what parts it consists of in that case and how. </p>
    <p class="normal1">The domain seems pretty straightforward so let’s move on to understand what parts it consists of.</p>
    <p class="normal1">At a high level, we understand what the system should do. But to solve the problem, we need to divide it into smaller parts, which in web development usually entails the following components:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Frontend</strong>: The frontend is the part of the system that the user interacts with. The frontend is responsible for presenting data to the user and receiving input from the user.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Backend</strong>: This part of the system communicates with the frontend. The backend is responsible for reading and writing data to a database. There could additionally be different frontends and different apps altogether that communicate with the backend in a more complex system.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Database</strong>: The database is the part of the system that stores data. It’s a data store, for example, a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The database is responsible for storing data in a way that’s efficient and easy to read and write.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Reporting</strong>: There’s often a reporting part that presents insights. It takes its data from the data store and may need to transform the data to make it presentable from a reporting perspective.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-41">Further breakdown of the frontend into features</h2>
    <p class="normal">Having an<a id="_idIndexMarker032" class="calibre3"/> overview like this is useful but usually not enough of a breakdown for us to start writing prompts. We need to break it down further, usually by features. At this point, a further breakdown of the frontend into features may look like the following list:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Login</strong>: The user needs to be able to log in to the system.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Logout</strong>: The user needs to be able to log out of the system.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">View inventory</strong>: The user needs to be able to view the inventory.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Add inventory</strong>: The user needs to be able to add the inventory.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Remove inventory</strong>: The user needs to be able to remove the inventory.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Update inventory</strong>: The user needs to be able to update the inventory.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-42">Generate prompts for each feature</h2>
    <p class="normal">At<a id="_idIndexMarker033" class="calibre3"/> this point, it’s granular enough for us to start writing prompts. Let’s take the first feature, login, and see how we can start thinking about how to craft a prompt.</p>
    <p class="normal1">You may start with a prompt, using a tool like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot (more on that in an upcoming next chapter) like the following:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Create a login page for the user to log in to the system.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">While this may work, you’re leaving out a lot of context, such as what exactly is needed here and what’s not, what technologies are you using, what the user experience is, and so on. </p>
    <p class="normal1">Let’s try to improve the prompt by adding more context:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Create a login page with fields for the username and password. It should have a link for creating a user and a login button, be vertically and horizontally centered, and work well on a mobile phone and tablet. It should be written in React and use the Material UI library.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-43">Identify some basic principles for web development, a “prompt strategy”</h2>
    <p class="normal">As you have seen <a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="calibre3"/>so far, we broke down the problem into smaller, more “manageable” pieces and we suggested some prompts for how to solve a specific feature. So what exactly are we suggesting in terms of “prompt strategy” now that we understand more about our example “inventory management”? For one, we realize that our strategy will be context-dependent. Because<a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="calibre3"/> we’re in web development, we need to use keywords within that domain, together with libraries and architecture suitable for a specific area. Here are some guides we suggest you use:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Provide context – fields</strong>: A login screen can be as simple as username and password fields. Most screens however have more fields, such as a password confirmation field, a link to reset a password, a field to create a new user, and so on. Depending on your needs, you may need to be very detailed.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Specify how – design, and tech choices</strong>: A login screen can be designed in many ways. It’s quite common today to optimize for different devices like tablets, mobile, large screens, and so on. For tech choices, web development has a lot of choices, from frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular to plain HTML and CSS. Specify according to the needs of the project.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Iterate</strong>: Different tools react differently to the same prompt. Throughout this book, we will show you how to use different tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT. Each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses and may offer different results. Try to iterate on the prompt by adding separators like commas and colons, and try rephrasing the prompt.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Be context-aware</strong>: When you use tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, you do so with preexisting context. For ChatGPT, that means you’re having an ongoing conversation of prompts and responses, and for GitHub Copilot, it means it sees not only what you’ve written in your open file but also your entire workspace if you let it. The response to your prompts looks at this context and decides what to generate. It’s important to be aware of this context and if you’re not getting the response you want, try to change the context, in ChatGPT, start a new conversation, and in GitHub Copilot, close the open files, start writing in a blank file, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-44">Prompt strategy for data science</h1>
    <p class="normal">Let’s do a similar <a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="calibre3"/>thought experiment for data science as we did for web development. We’ll use the presented guidelines “problem breakdown” and “generate prompts,” and just like in the web development section, we’ll draw some general conclusions on the domain and present those as a prompt strategy for data science.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-45">Problem breakdown: predict sales</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let’s say we’re building a<a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="calibre3"/> machine-learning model to predict sales. At a high level, we understand what the system should do. To solve the problem though, we need to divide it into smaller parts, which in data science usually entails the following components:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Data</strong>: The data is the part of the system that stores information. The data can come from many places like databases, web endpoints, static files, and more.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Model</strong>: The model is responsible for learning from the data and producing a prediction that’s as accurate as possible. To predict, you need an input that produces one or more outputs as a prediction.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Training</strong>: The training is the part of the system that trains the model. Here, you typically have part of your data as training and a part being sample data.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Evaluation</strong>: To ensure your model works as intended, you need to evaluate it. Evaluation means taking the data and model and producing a score that indicates how well the model performs.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Visualization</strong>: Visualization is the part where you can gain insights valuable for the business via graphs. This part is very important, as it’s the part that’s most visible to the business.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-46">Further breakdown into features/steps for data science</h2>
    <p class="normal">At this point, you’re at <a id="_idIndexMarker038" class="calibre3"/>too high a level to start writing prompts. We can break it down further by looking at each step:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Data</strong>: The data part has many steps, including collecting the data, cleaning it, and transforming it. Here’s how you can break it down:<ol class="numberedlist">
          <li class="numberedlist1" value="1"><strong class="screentext">Collect data</strong>: The data needs to be collected from somewhere. It could be a database, a web endpoint, a static file, and so on.</li>
          <li class="numberedlist1"><strong class="screentext">Clean data</strong>: The data needs to be cleaned. Cleaning means removing data that’s not relevant, removing duplicates, and so on.</li>
          <li class="numberedlist1"><strong class="screentext">Transform data</strong>: The data needs to be transformed. Transformation means changing the data to a format that’s useful for the model.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Training</strong>: Just like the data part, the training part has many steps to it. Here’s how you can break it down:<ol class="numberedlist">
          <li class="numberedlist1" value="1"><strong class="screentext">Split data</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker039" class="calibre3"/> data needs to be split into training and sample data. The training data is used to train the model and the sample data is used to evaluate the model.</li>
          <li class="numberedlist1"><strong class="screentext">Train model</strong>: The model needs to be trained. Training means taking the training data and learning from it.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Evaluation</strong>: The evaluation part is usually a single step but can be broken down further.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-47">Generate prompts for each step</h2>
    <p class="normal">Note how our breakdown<a id="_idIndexMarker040" class="calibre3"/> for data science looks a bit different from web development. Instead of identifying features like <strong class="screentext">Add inventory</strong>, we instead have a feature like Collect data. </p>
    <p class="normal1">However, we’re on the correct level to author a prompt, so let’s use the <strong class="screentext">Collect data</strong> feature as our example: </p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Collect data from <code class="inlinecode">data.xls</code> and read it into a DataFrame using Pandas library.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">The preceding prompt is both general and specific at the same time. It’s general in the sense that it tells you to “collect data” but specific in that it specifies a specific library to use and even what data structure (DataFrame). It’s entirely possible that a simpler prompt would have worked for the preceding step like so:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Collect data from data.xls.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">This is where it may vary depending on whether you use a tool like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-48">Identify some basic principles for data science, “a prompt strategy for data science”</h2>
    <p class="normal">Here, we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="calibre3"/>identified some similar principles as in the web development example:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Provide context – filename</strong>: A CSV file can have any name. It’s important to specify the name of the file.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Specify how – libraries</strong>: There are many ways to load a CSV file, and even though Pandas library is a common choice, it’s important to specify it. There are other libraries to work with and you might need a solution for Java, C#, and Rust, for example, where libraries are named differently.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Iterate</strong>: It’s worth iterating on the prompt, rephrasing it, and adding separators like a comma, a colon, and so on.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Be context-aware</strong>: Also here, context matters a lot; if you’re working in Notebook, previous cells will be available to GitHub Copilot, previous conversations will be available to ChatGPT, and so on. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">As you can see from the preceding guidance, the strategy is very similar for web development. Here we’re also listing “Provide,” “Specify how,” “Iterate,” and “Be context-aware.” The big difference lies in the details. However, there’s an alternate strategy that works in data science and that’s lengthy prompts. Even though we’ve broken down the data science problem into features, we don’t need to write a prompt per feature. Another way of solving it could be to express everything you want to be carried out in one large prompt. Such a prompt could therefore look like so:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">You want to predict sales on the file <code class="inlinecode">data.xsl</code>. Use Python and Pandas library. Here are the steps that you should carry out:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist">Collect data</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Clean data</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Transform data</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Split data</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Train model</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Evaluation</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">You will see examples in future chapters on data science and machine learning where both smaller prompts as well as lengthier prompts are being used. You decide which approach you want to use.</p>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-49">Validate the solution</h1>
    <p class="normal">The most important part<a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="calibre3"/> of this strategy is verifying correctness and that the text and code created by the AI assistant are correct. There are two general approaches we can take to verify our outcome:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Verification via prompts</strong>: The first approach is to use prompts to verify the outcome. This means writing prompts that question the outcome of specific results. This can be a good strategy to employ at the beginning of your verification process. What you’re looking for are situations where the AI assistant isn’t consistent in its responses. </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Classical verifications</strong>: The second approach is to use classical verification techniques. What those techniques are varies depending on the problem domain. At a high level, though, it boils down to testing code, comparing output, and relying on your own knowledge, and the knowledge of your peers, to verify the outcome.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">The AI tool doesn’t really know what it’s doing. The responses provided are responses that likely depend on its training corpus. At all times, you should be aware of this and rely on your expertise to verify the outcome.</p>
    <p class="normal1">In the next subsections, let’s explore various approaches for manual and classical verification.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-50">Verification via prompts</h2>
    <p class="normal">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="calibre3"/>use prompts to both produce results that take you closer to resolving the problem but also to verify the results. Let’s take an example where we’re building the previously mentioned login screen. We’ve written a prompt that looks like the following:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Create a login page with fields for username and password; it should have a link for creating a user and a login button. It should be vertically and horizontally centered and work well on a mobile phone and tablet. It should be written in React and use the Material UI library.</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">To verify this<a id="_idIndexMarker044" class="calibre3"/> outcome, we can write a prompt like the following:</p>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[Prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">Given the below code, what does it do?</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs-code">.login {
  <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- should include CSS to center horizontally and vertically and be responsive --&gt;</span>
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- should include CSS to center horizontally and vertically and be responsive --&gt;</span>
  }
}
<span>&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name">div</span><span> </span><span class="hljs-attr">class</span><span>=</span><span class="hljs-string">"login"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name">TextField</span><span> </span><span class="hljs-attr">id</span><span>=</span><span class="hljs-string">"username"</span><span> </span><span class="hljs-attr">label</span><span>=</span><span class="hljs-string">"Username"</span><span> /&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name">TextField</span><span> </span><span class="hljs-attr">id</span><span>=</span><span class="hljs-string">"password"</span><span> </span><span class="hljs-attr">label</span><span>=</span><span class="hljs-string">"Password"</span><span> /&gt;</span>

    Login
  <span>&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name">Button</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name">div</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal1"><strong class="screentext">[End of prompt]</strong></p>
    <p class="normal1">An app could look at the code provided and realize you don’t need a prompt to deduce what it does, and that it’s in fact missing CSS code to make it responsive. The point here though is that by writing prompts, you can have the AI assistant tell you what it thinks the code does via questions. </p>
    <p class="normal1">Using prompts this way, to pose queries on the output, is a good first step to verifying the outcome. However, it’s not enough and you need to rely on classical verification techniques, so let’s cover that next.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-51">Classical verification</h2>
    <p class="normal">How you <a id="_idIndexMarker045" class="calibre3"/>verify the outcome depends on the problem domain. In web development, you can use a variety of different tools and techniques, for example:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Testing</strong>: With end-to-end testing or frontend testing, you can verify that the code works as intended. Usually, this type of test involves using a programmatic approach to simulate user interaction with the web page, using something like Selenium, for example.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Manual testing</strong>: You can manually test the web page by opening it in a browser and interacting with it. This is a good approach to use at the beginning of your verification process. Apart from interaction, you can also visually inspect the web page to see if it looks correct according to your requirements.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Code review</strong>: You can review the code and see if it looks correct. This is a good approach to use at the beginning of your verification process. It allows not only you but also your peers to verify the outcome.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Tools</strong>: Tools can test a variety of different scenarios like accessibility, performance, and so on. These tools are most likely a part of your development process already.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">Conducting data science, you may rely on all of the preceding approaches, but you may also use other approaches. Some common approaches are:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Unit testing</strong>: You can use unit testing to verify that the code works as intended. </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Integration testing</strong>: You can use integration testing to verify that the code works as intended.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Validation of results</strong>: This type of validation means you compare the results of your analysis or model to known results or benchmarks.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Cross validation</strong>: This type of validation means you split your data into training and sample data, train your model on the training data, and evaluate it on the sample data. This is a good approach to use at the beginning of your verification process. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-52">Summary</h1>
