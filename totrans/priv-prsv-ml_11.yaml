- en: We cover the concepts of homomorphic encryption (HE) and SMC as privacy-enhancing
    techniques. We highlight the significance of these cryptographic approaches in
    enabling secure computations on encrypted data without compromising privacy.

- en: SMC enables multiple parties to collaboratively compute results while keeping
    their individual input private. Our summary emphasizes the importance of HE and
    SMC in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be analyzed or processed in a privacy-preserving
    manner. By utilizing these techniques, organizations and individuals can protect
    their data while still gaining valuable insights and outcomes from computations.

- en: The second chapter in this part explores the concept of confidential computing,
    which aims to provide a trusted and secure environment for processing sensitive
    data. This chapter also provides an overview of the current state of confidential
    computing, highlighting the advancements and ongoing research in this field. It
    acknowledges the emergence of trusted execution environments (TEEs) and hardware-based
    solutions that provide secure enclaves for confidential computing.

- en: The final chapter introduces generative AI and the fundamentals of LLMs, the
    privacy vulnerabilities associated with them, and the technologies and approaches
    to preserve privacy while using these models. This chapter covers developing LLM
    applications using open source LLMs and protecting them from privacy attacks (prompt
    injection attacks, membership inference attacks, etc.) and ends with state-of-the-art
    privacy research on LLMs.
