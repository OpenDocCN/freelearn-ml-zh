Maybe, you heard of Sci-Fi-sounding features, such as face detection, and got intrigued. If this is the case, you've made the perfect choice. <span class="strong"><strong>OpenCV</strong></span> stands for <span class="strong"><strong>Open Source Computer Vision</strong></span>. It is a free <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>computer vision library that allows you to manipulate images and videos to accomplish a variety of tasks from displaying the feed of a webcam to potentially teaching a robot to recognize real-life objects.</p><p>In this book, you will learn to leverage the immense potential of OpenCV with the Python programming language. Python is an elegant language with a relatively shallow learning curve and very powerful features. This chapter is a quick guide to setting up Python 2.7, OpenCV, and other related libraries. After setup, we also look at OpenCV's Python sample scripts and documentation.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>If you wish to skip the installation process and jump right into action, you can download the <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>

As previously mentioned, MacPorts' build recipes are defined in configuration files called Portfiles. By creating or editing Portfiles, we can access highly configurable build tools, such as CMake, while also benefitting from MacPorts' features, such as dependency resolution.</p><p>Let's assume that we already have MacPorts installed. Now, we can configure MacPorts to use the custom Portfiles that we write:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a folder somewhere to hold our custom Portfiles.

Every two years, however, Ubuntu releases a version classified as <span class="strong"><strong>long-term support</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>LTS</strong></span>) which will grant you a five year support by Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu). If you work in an enterprise environment, it is certainly advisable to install one of the LTS versions. The latest one available is 14.04.</p><p>Ubuntu comes with Python 2.7 preinstalled. The standard Ubuntu repository contains OpenCV 2.4.9 packages without support for depth cameras. At the time of writing this, OpenCV 3 is not yet available through the Ubuntu repositories, so we will have to build it from source. Fortunately, the vast majority of Unix-like and Linux systems come with all the necessary software to build a project from scratch already installed. When built from source, OpenCV can support depth cameras via OpenNI and SensorKinect, which are available as precompiled binaries with installation scripts.</p><div class="section" title="Using the Ubuntu repository (no support for depth cameras)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec07"/>Using the Ubuntu repository (no support for depth cameras)</h3></div></div></div><p>We can <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>install Python and all its necessary dependencies using the <code class="literal">apt</code> package manager, by running the following commands:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; sudo apt-get install build-essential</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec­dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Equivalently, we <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>could have used Ubuntu Software Center, which is the <code class="literal">apt</code> package manager's graphical frontend.</p></div><div class="section" title="Building OpenCV from a source"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec08"/>Building OpenCV from a source</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>we have the entire Python stack and <code class="literal">cmake</code> installed, we can build OpenCV. First, we need to download the source code from <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.0.0-beta.zip">https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.0.0-beta.zip</a>.</p><p>Extract the archive and move it into the unzipped folder in a terminal.</p><p>Then, run the following commands:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; mkdir build</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; cd build</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; make</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt; make install</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>After the installation terminates, you might want to look at OpenCV's Python samples in <code class="literal">&lt;opencv_folder&gt;/opencv/samples/python</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;script_folder&gt;/opencv/samples/python2</code>.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Installation on other Unix-like systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Installation on other Unix-like systems</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>approaches for Ubuntu (as described <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>previously) are likely to work on any Linux distribution derived from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or Ubuntu 14.10 as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Kubuntu 14.04 LTS or Kubuntu 14.10</li><li class="listitem">Xubuntu 14.04 LTS or Xubuntu 14.10</li><li class="listitem">Linux Mint 17</li></ul></div><p>On Debian Linux and its derivatives, the <code class="literal">apt</code> package manager works the same as on Ubuntu, though the available packages may differ.</p><p>On Gentoo Linux and its derivatives, the Portage package manager is similar to MacPorts (as described previously), though the available packages may differ.</p><p>On FreeBSD derivatives, the process of installation is again similar to MacPorts; in fact, MacPorts derives from the <code class="literal">ports</code> installation system adopted on FreeBSD. Consult the remarkable FreeBSD Handbook at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/</a> for an overview of the software installation process.</p><p>On other Unix-like systems, the package manager and available packages may differ. Consult your package manager's documentation and search for packages with <code class="literal">opencv</code> in their names. Remember that OpenCV and its Python bindings might be split into multiple packages.</p><p>Also, look for any installation notes published by the system provider, the repository maintainer, or the community. Since OpenCV uses camera drivers and media codecs, getting all of its functionality to work can be tricky on systems with poor multimedia support. Under some circumstances, system packages might need to be reconfigured or reinstalled for compatibility.</p><p>If packages are available for OpenCV, check their version number. OpenCV 3 or higher is recommended for this book's purposes. Also, check whether the packages offer Python bindings and depth camera support via OpenNI and SensorKinect. Finally, check whether anyone in the developer community has reported success or failure in using the packages.</p><p>If, instead, we <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>want to do a custom build of OpenCV <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>from source, it might be helpful to refer to the installation script for Ubuntu (as discussed previously) and adapt it to the package manager and packages that are present on another system.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Installing the Contrib modules" id="aid-E9OE1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Installing the Contrib modules</h1></div></div></div><p>Unlike with <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>OpenCV 2.4, some modules are contained in a repository called <code class="literal">opencv_contrib</code>, which is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib">https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib</a>. I highly recommend installing these modules as they contain extra functionalities that are not included in OpenCV, such as the face recognition module.</p><p>Once downloaded (either through <code class="literal">zip</code> or <code class="literal">git</code>, I recommend <code class="literal">git</code> so that you can keep up to date with a simple <code class="literal">git pull</code> command), you can rerun your <code class="literal">cmake</code> command to include the building of OpenCV with the <code class="literal">opencv_contrib</code> modules as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=&lt;opencv_contrib&gt;/modules &lt;opencv_source_directory&gt;</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>So, if you've followed the standard procedure and created a build directory in your OpenCV download folder, you should run the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=&lt;opencv_contrib&gt;/modules  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..</strong></span>

Find the samples in <code class="literal">&lt;unzip_destination&gt;/OpenCV-3.0.0/samples</code>.</p><p>Some of the sample scripts require command-line arguments. However, the following scripts (among others) should work without any arguments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">python/camera.py</code>: This script displays a webcam feed (assuming that a webcam is plugged in).</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">python/drawing.py</code>: This script draws a series of shapes, such as a screensaver.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">python2/hist.py</code>: This script displays a photo.

For example, slowly wave your hand at the webcam to see the effect.

There are two possible explanations for this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Some steps in the OpenCV installation might have failed or been missed. Go back and review the steps.</li><li class="listitem">If we have multiple Python installations on the machine, we might be using the wrong version of Python to launch the script. For example, on Mac, it might be the case that OpenCV is installed for MacPorts Python, but we are running the script with the system's Python. Go back and review the installation steps about editing the system path. Also, try launching the script manually from the command line using commands such as this:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ python python/camera.py</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You can also use the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ python2.7 python/camera.py</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>As another possible means of selecting a different Python installation, try editing the sample script to remove the <code class="literal">#!</code> lines.
