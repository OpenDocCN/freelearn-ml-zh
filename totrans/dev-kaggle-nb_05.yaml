    a pile of data, or we try to uncover elusive evidence using a systematic, sometimes

    services. These individuals can benefit from Kiva’s services to borrow small amounts

    impoverished people in different parts of the world, Kiva wanted to better understand
    the conditions of each potential borrower. Due to the diversity of the problems

    The scope of the competition was to combine features from each loan into various
    poverty datasets and determine the actual welfare level of potential borrowers,
    categorizing them by region, gender, and sector. The evaluation of competitors’
    contributions in this competition was based on the granularity of the analysis,
    emphasizing adherence to local specifics, clarity of the explanation, and the
    originality of the approach. The competition organizers aimed to directly use
    the best analyses, hence the emphasis on localization and a clear explanation.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to stress from the start that one good solution for an analytics
    competition is not necessarily a complete exploratory data analysis. From my experience
    with several analytics competitions and examining top-ranking solutions, I can
    say that sometimes the criteria for scoring in an analytics competition are quite
    the opposite. While the criteria may evolve over time, some are repeatedly adopted.
    For example, evaluators frequently prioritize the originality of the approach
    over the composition and the documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To obtain high scores on these criteria, authors will have to prepare themselves
    thoroughly. An extended exploration of the data is still necessary so that the
    results presented can be fully documented. While useful for research purposes,
    this approach doesn’t need to be fully included in the narrative of the solution
    notebook. The author can select and discuss, in their story, a small part of the
    data, as long as the narrative is consistent and makes a strong, compelling case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The author must select, from the rich data they explored, only those elements
    that will support their story. So composition is equally important, and the selected

    and a much larger percentage of the **bullet** repayment type than **irregular**.
    The **bullet** type is most probably characteristic of cyclic activities, like

    positive correlation with infant mortality rate and is correlated with a fertility
    rate (0.78). It is also positively correlated with the population, using improved
    sanitation facilities (0.45), urban population growth rate (0.56), the percentage
    of agriculture in the economy (0.54), or the percentage of the population involved
    in agriculture (0.35). These are examples of factors that will increase when there
    is more poverty. It is interesting that the urban population growth rate is correlated
    with MPI. This is because population displacement is not always caused by more
    people moving to cities for employment but because many people are displaced,
    due to a lack of resources in rural areas. It is also inversely correlated with
    total expenditure for health (-0.2), the seats held by women in parliaments (-0.64),
    and the percentage of industry (-0.21) and services in the economy (-0.36).

    is a combination of factors. This specific combination of factors leading to poverty
    depends on each region, and even on each specific case. We adopt visualization
    tools to highlight this multidimensional essence of poverty. We will use radar
    (a.k.a. spider) graphs for several countries with selected dimensions relevant
    to poverty. In a radar (or spider – so-named because it resembles a spider web)
    graph, the axes (radial) represent individual features under consideration. The
    area of the graph reflects the magnitude of the cumulative effect of the individual
    features. For small features, we obtain a small area. For large features, the
    area is large. In our case, we want to illustrate poverty (or the MPI cumulative
    factor) by the number of features or the factors that contribute to poverty.

    and the field partners of Kiva and more on borrowers and what defines their poverty.
    Our intention was to create an analysis targeting the factors of poverty, understanding
    these factors and how they each contribute to maintaining poverty. We started
    by explaining that when we start working on an analytics competition, we need
    to start with a hypothesis or a subject and restrict our analysis to a part of
    the data – one that is relevant to our direction of research.

    the preliminary steps, where we conduct an exhaustive analysis of data (like we
    did in the previous chapter, where a final analysis using both the Starbucks and
    pubs data was prepared and supported by our preliminary EDAs for the two datasets
    separately). Our focus was on understanding what defines poverty best, and for
    this, we combined Kiva data with additional data from the UN.

    the countries, regions, and categories that are most exposed to the different
    aspects that characterize poverty. A radar chart can be a useful tool. In designing
    it, we selected those metrics or modified some of them, giving us a higher total
    area with higher poverty.

    different forms and be defined by multiple and, sometimes, interdependent factors.
    Targeting the factors that have the potential to also influence others, like increased
    school attendance, improved sanitation conditions, alimentation, and healthcare,
    also through Kiva anti-poverty programmes, might increase the positive social
    impact.

    We will look at the data in the Meta Kaggle dataset (see *Reference 2*) and attempt
    to answer a question related to the perception of a recent trend in creating large
    teams for competitions. The ultimate intention is to show that we can get important

    about the recent trend of having a higher number of competitors teaming up, especially
    for high-profile, featured competitions. I was intrigued by this claim trending
    on the discussion boards, and I decided to use Kaggle’s own data from the Meta
    Kaggle dataset (which is constantly updated by Kaggle) to verify this information.
    To maintain the results of that analysis, I will restrict the data from Meta Kaggle
    to values before the end of 2019\. Since 2019, some of the metadata keywords have
    changed. Competitions that used to be named “In Class” are now renamed “Community.”
    Although in current versions of the dataset, the category now has the name “Community,”
    we will use both terms, and sometimes only “In Class,” as it was used at the time
    this analysis was first performed.

    correlated in any way with the team rankings. To do this, we count the number
    of team members for each team and year. We then merge the results with the `Teams`
    dataset to have, in one dataset, the number of team members per team and the public
    and private leaderboard rank. *Figure 5.17* shows the heatmap with the team size
    and team ranking (the public and private leaderboard) for the years between 2010
    and 2019\. Although there is a very small negative correlation value, we observe
    the following for the value of correlation between the private leaderboard and
    public leaderboard ranks and the team size. There exists a very small inverse
    correlation factor, signifying that team size tends to increase as the rank value
    decreases. In other words, the closer a team is to the top, the larger its size
    becomes. Values are between -0.02 and -0.12 (very small inverse correlation values)
    and increase (in absolute values) over time.

    to be larger for higher positions on the public leaderboard; this would maybe
    allow us to speculate on the opportunistic quality of the large teams, especially

    insights from it.
