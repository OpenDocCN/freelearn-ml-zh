			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Chapter 2</em>: Setting Up Your GCP and BigQuery Environment</h1>
			<p>The first steps of using a new public cloud provider can be complex, and sometimes you might feel overwhelmed by all the services and options in front of you. Cloud vendors offer a vast variety of components and resources to solve different use cases. With this plethora of modules, it is not easy to decide which service to use. Fortunately, to create and run a <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>) project, you don't have to have specific technical<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> skills or a large budget to invest. Regardless of whether you are a private user or an employee of a large company, GCP offers the possibility to use its cloud services simply by creating an account and a project on the platform. It is also possible to leverage a free trial to get credits and test products for a limited period of time.</p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter will help to create a solid foundation for your technical environment, and the tasks covered should be performed only once. To avoid any kind of uncertainty and disorientation, in this chapter, you'll be taken step by step through the following activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating your GCP account and project</li>
				<li>Activating BigQuery</li>
				<li>Discovering the BigQuery web UI</li>
				<li>Exploring BigQuery public datasets</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter requires you to have access to a web browser. To perform the steps described in this chapter, we suggest using one of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google Chrome</li>
				<li>Firefox</li>
				<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
				<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 11+</li>
				<li>Safari 8+ (Safari Private Browsing mode is not supported)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that you're ready with a supported web browser, let's dive into the creation of a new GCP account and project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Creating your GCP account and project</h1>
			<p>The first step<a id="_idIndexMarker152"/> to start using GCP is the creation of a new <strong class="bold">GCP account</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> a new <strong class="bold">project</strong>. A project is a container of multiple GCP resources, and it is usually accessed by users through their accounts. Examples of GCP resources include Google Compute Engine VMs, Google Cloud Storage buckets, App Engine instances, and BigQuery datasets. A GCP project is also linked to a billing account to which all of the costs of services consumption are charged. GCP objects can be organized hierarchically. Projects are the first level of the hierarchy and can be grouped into <strong class="bold">folders</strong>. Each folder can have another folder or an <strong class="bold">organization</strong> node as a parent. The organization is at the top of the GCP hierarchy and cannot have a parent.</p>
			<p>In the following diagram, you can see a hierarchy composed of an organization node, two main folders, and two nested folders linked to three different GCP projects:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_001.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – GCP resource hierarchy composed of resources, projects, folders, and an organization&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – GCP resource hierarchy composed of resources, projects, folders, and an organization</p>
			<p>According to GCP <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>best practices, it is suggested that you create different projects<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> to separate different environments, such<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> as <strong class="bold">development</strong>, <strong class="bold">test</strong>, <strong class="bold">quality assurance</strong>, and <strong class="bold">production</strong>. Folders <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>are particularly useful to segregate workloads that <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>belong<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> to different departments or different teams within the same company. The creation of an organization node is not required but one can be used to group all the workloads of an entire company or legal entity. The organization and the folder nodes are used to assign uniform policies and permissions across the company's departments with a unique and centralized point of control.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">To use GCP folders, the creation of an organization node is mandatory. If the organization node is not created, each project will be considered logically separated from the others and cannot be grouped into a folder.</p>
			<p>For the hands-on exercises of this book, we'll simply create a GCP project. This is the only necessary <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>item to organize all the BigQuery datasets that we will create <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>throughout the chapters of the book.</p>
			<p>Now that we've learned how GCP resources are organized, let's take a look at how to create a new <strong class="bold">Google account</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Registering a GCP account</h2>
			<p>To start using<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> GCP, we need at least one user. A user is a <strong class="bold">member</strong> configured<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> in the <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) system. The goal of IAM is to grant the right access and permissions to the right members. GCP supports different types of members:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Google account</strong>: Any <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>person that may interact with GCP, identified by an email address, such as a Gmail account.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service account</strong>: A technical user, not directly linked to a human user. This is assigned to a GCP service to interact with and access other resources.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Google Workspace domain</strong>: A user group created in Google's productivity suite Workspace. It includes multiple members identified by the same domain, such as <a href="mailto:user1@companyxyz.com">user1@companyxyz.com</a>, <strong class="source-inline">user2@companyxyz.com</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">user3@companyxyz.com</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud Identity domain</strong>: Similar to the Google Workspace domain, with the only difference being that this group of users doesn't have access to Google's productivity suite.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Google group</strong>: Represents<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> a group of accounts. It is linked to an email alias and can be used to assign the same permissions and grants to multiple accounts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For our purposes, we'll create a simple Google account using the free trial that is offered by Google and<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> available at this address: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">https://cloud.google.com/free</a>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_002.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Google Cloud web page to access the GCP free trial&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Google Cloud web page to access the GCP free trial</p>
			<p>This free option enables you to get started with GCP at no cost and offers the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The possibility to leverage the free tiers of each GCP service, including BigQuery. This option has no expiration.</li>
				<li>A limited credit amount of $300 to overcome the limits of the free tiers or to use other services. This credit expires in 90 days.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you haven't created a GCP project yet, start by selecting <strong class="bold">Get started for free</strong>, or click <strong class="bold">Sign In</strong> to access your existing GCP console. For educational purposes, we'll select <strong class="bold">Get started for free</strong> to show the entire process of account creation, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Creation of a Google account for GCP</p>
			<p>If you don't have an existing email address, you can directly create a Gmail account during the GCP <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>registration process. For the account creation process, it is necessary to specify your first and last name, an existing or new email address, and a strong password to access GCP.</p>
			<p>After accepting the privacy terms, you will be redirected to the GCP registration process, which is basically composed of two steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the first step, you need to select your country, read and agree to the terms of service, and then sign up to receive updates from Google and its partners. As shown on the right-hand side of <em class="italic">Figure 2.4</em>, the registration page summarizes the main conditions of the free trial:<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_004.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – First step of GCP account creation&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – First step of GCP account creation</p></li>
				<li>The second <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>step requires you to provide all the information that is necessary for the billing of your GCP projects. This step asks for your billing address and a credit card to start using GCP:<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_005.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Details to provide to create a GCP account&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Details to provide to create a GCP account</p></li>
				<li>At the end of the process, select <strong class="bold">Start my free trial</strong>; you will be ready to access the<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> home page of Google Cloud Console.<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Although a credit card is required for the creation of a Google Cloud account, the credit card will not be used until you explicitly decide to upgrade the account from the free tier to the paid version.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we've created our Google account and we have accessed Google Cloud Console for the first time, in the next section we'll explore the main features of this web interface.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Exploring Google Cloud Console</h2>
			<p>Google Cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> Console allows users to access and use all the GCP resources using a graphical user interface.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see Google Cloud Console and its main sections: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer034" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_006.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Overview of the functionalities of Google Cloud Console&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Overview of the functionalities of Google Cloud Console</p>
			<p>Starting from the <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>top-left corner, you can see the hamburger button to access the navigation menu (<strong class="screen-inline">1</strong>). This menu allows you to browse among all the GCP resources and select which service to use. Moving to the right, just after the GCP logo, you'll see the name of the current GCP project (<strong class="screen-inline">2</strong>), which shows you which environment is currently in use. The search bar (<strong class="screen-inline">3</strong>), positioned at the top of the page, allows us to look for specific resources or technologies in our project and can be considered an alternative to the navigation menu.</p>
			<p>Focusing on the top-right corner, we can find <strong class="bold">Cloud Shell</strong> (<strong class="screen-inline">4</strong>). This tool provides the possibility to use, for free, a Linux command line directly from Google Cloud Console. This Linux environment is already pre-configured with the Google Cloud SDK to easily provision and manage resources in your GCP project. Furthermore, it can be used to temporarily store data because it offers 5 GB of capacity at no cost.</p>
			<p>Moving further to the left, you can see the account settings (<strong class="screen-inline">5</strong>) function, which is used to access your Google account profile and to log out if needed.</p>
			<p>Most of the central area of the screen is occupied by the dashboard (<strong class="screen-inline">6</strong>). It contains some cards, which provide an overview of your GCP project at a glance. The cards are widgets that can be shown <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>or hidden through the <strong class="bold">Customize</strong> (<strong class="screen-inline">7</strong>) button on the right.</p>
			<p>Now that we've taken a look at the home page of the GCP console, we're ready to create a new GCP project that will host all the hands-on activities of this book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Creating a GCP project</h2>
			<p>As we've <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>explained, a GCP project is a container for all the GCP resources that we use. Each project is identified by the following features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project name</strong>: An easy-to-remember <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>and readable name chosen during the creation phase. The name doesn't have to be unique; it has a purely descriptive function and can be changed after project creation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project ID</strong>: This identifier is unique and is assigned by the user or automatically generated by Google during the creation of a new project. Unlike the project name, it cannot be modified. The ID needs to be unique across GCP.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project number</strong>: An identifier that is automatically generated by GCP and cannot be changed by the users. It's also unique across GCP.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Looking at Google Cloud Console in the <strong class="bold">Project info</strong> card, all these identifiers can be easily read:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_007.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – The Project info widget shows the identifiers of a GCP project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – The Project info widget shows the identifiers of a GCP project</p>
			<p>By selecting the<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> name of the project that's currently in use, we can access the entire list of GCP projects that we're allowed to access:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_008.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – By selecting the name of the project in use, it is possible to change it&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – By selecting the name of the project in use, it is possible to change it</p>
			<p>Clicking opens a pop-up window that allows us to change the current project or to browse the GCP hierarchy of organization, folders, and projects. In our case, the only existing GCP project is <strong class="bold">My First Project</strong>, which was automatically created during the registration process.</p>
			<p>Let's go through the process of creating a new project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">By selecting the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> button at the top-right corner of the window, it is possible to create a new environment to logically separate cloud workloads. For our purposes, we'll create a dedicated GCP project to host all the hands-on exercises that <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>will follow in the chapters of this book:<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_009.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – This window allows you to select an existing project or create a new one&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – This window allows you to select an existing project or create a new one</p></li>
				<li>In the next step, you are asked to fill in the project name. In this case, we'll use <strong class="source-inline">bigqueryml-packt</strong>, but you can choose another one. This is also the place where it is possible to link your GCP project to a parent object such as an organization or a folder. Upon selecting <strong class="bold">Edit</strong>, you have also the opportunity to change the automatically generated project ID. The new project will be created by you clicking the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button:<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_010.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – The New Project window allows you to choose the project name, ID, and location&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – The New Project window allows you to choose the project name, ID, and location</p></li>
				<li>After a few <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>seconds, we will get a notification about the creation of the new project, visible at the top-right corner of the GCP console by clicking on the bell icon: <div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_011.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – A notification is sent to the GCP user when a new project is created and ready to be used&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – A notification is sent to the GCP user when a new project is created and ready to be used</p></li>
				<li>After creation, the new GCP project is also visible in the project hierarchy and can be selected in order to choose it as the current working environment:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_012.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – After the project's creation, it is possible to make it the current project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – After the project's creation, it is possible to make it the current project</p>
			<p>Now that we've<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> created a new project, it is time to start using BigQuery. In the next section, we'll learn how to activate the service before using it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Activating BigQuery</h1>
			<p>Each GCP service<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> can be enabled or disabled according to the customer's needs and the use case that it is required to implement. For our purposes, we'll show the steps that are necessary to activate the BigQuery service, but the same approach can be extended to other GCP technologies:</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Enabling or disabling a GCP service will not impact the billing of your GCP project. You'll be charged only for the actual usage of GCP components and not for just having a service enabled. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The first step is to access the API and services library, which can be easily found in the<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> navigation menu of Google Cloud Console:<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_013.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – From the navigation menu of the GCP console, &#13;&#10;it is possible to access the library of GCP services&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – From the navigation menu of the GCP console, it is possible to access the library of GCP services</p><p>This function lets you browse the entire library of GCP services and choose services to turn on or off. </p></li>
				<li>If we search for <em class="italic">bigquery</em> in the search bar, the first result will be <strong class="bold">BigQuery API</strong>:<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16722_02_014.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14 – Looking for bigquery using the search bar, it is possible to find the BigQuery API service&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – Looking for bigquery using the search bar, it is possible to find the BigQuery API service</p></li>
				<li>Upon clicking on <strong class="bold">BigQuery API</strong>, we'll be redirected to a page dedicated to the BigQuery<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> service, where it is possible to read a description of the service, access the BigQuery documentation, and enable the service if that wasn't done before. If the service was disabled, trying to access BigQuery directly from the navigation menu would have redirected us to the same page.</li>
				<li>Selecting the <strong class="bold">Enable</strong> button, GCP will activate BigQuery, allowing you to start using it. Once the service is effectively enabled, you will be redirected to the dashboard of the service, which shows an overview of the usage statistics and lets you disable this component with the <strong class="bold">Disable API</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So far, we've created a new Google account and a dedicated GCP project, and we've enabled BigQuery; now it's time to take a look at the BigQuery web interface.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Discovering the BigQuery web UI</h1>
			<p>When the BigQuery<a id="_idIndexMarker182"/> APIs are enabled, in order to access the BigQuery UI, you can open the GCP navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">BigQuery</strong> from the list of Google Cloud services.</p>
			<p>At first glance (see the following screenshot), the BigQuery UI might seem complex because it contains a lot of information and buttons. On the left side of the screen, we can see a column occupied by the navigation panel (<strong class="bold">1</strong>). This panel is split into two main sections. In the upper one, you can access the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Query history</strong>, which tracks all the queries previously executed with their execution statuses.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Saved queries</strong>, an area to store the queries that you save and use more frequently. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Job history</strong>, to keep track of all the bulk load, export, and copy operations with their execution statuses.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transfers</strong> enables us to<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> ingest data into BigQuery, leveraging <strong class="bold">BigQuery Data Transfer Service</strong> from <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) applications, such as Google <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>Analytics, Google Ads, or Amazon S3.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scheduled queries</strong>, to periodically schedule a query or to monitor queries already scheduled for execution.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reservations</strong>, to reserve BigQuery processing power with the flat-rate pricing model.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BI Engine</strong> allows you to activate an in-memory layer on top of BigQuery to further increase performance and get sub-second latencies for reporting activities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resources</strong> allows you to browse different GCP projects and datasets.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the lower part of the navigation panel, we can access and browse projects, related BigQuery datasets, and data structures such as tables, views, and machine learning models (<strong class="bold">2</strong>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16722_02_015.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – All the functionalities of the BigQuery web interface&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15 – All the functionalities of the BigQuery web interface</p>
			<p>At the top center<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> of the web page, you can leverage the web query editor (<strong class="bold">3</strong>) to write SQL statements and run these queries using the <strong class="bold">Run</strong> button (<strong class="bold">4</strong>). The web query editor can be hidden by the developer with the <strong class="bold">HIDE EDITOR</strong> button in the top-right corner or cleared by selecting <strong class="bold">COMPOSE NEW QUERY</strong> (<strong class="bold">5</strong>). Below the query editor, you can visualize the results of the executed queries and the details of each selected item (<strong class="bold">6</strong>), such as a dataset or a table. Between the two sections of the web interface, it is possible to access the <strong class="bold">Query Scheduler</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">7</strong>). Clicking on the <strong class="bold">More</strong> button (<strong class="bold">8</strong>), it is also possible to access the BigQuery options and the SQL formatter, which is used to make SQL queries readable.</p>
			<p>On the right-hand side of the <strong class="bold">bigqueryml-packt</strong> panel, you can select/click <strong class="bold">CREATE DATASET</strong> (<strong class="bold">9</strong>) to create a new BigQuery dataset.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Among the BigQuery options, you can find the options to enable or disable the BigQuery cache. If the cache is enabled, BigQuery tries to use cached results if they are available. If the result of a query is already in the cache, the query is not executed. The cache is used to save computational resources and get high performance. If a query contains non-deterministic functions, such as <strong class="source-inline">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">NOW()</strong>, the cache is not used and BigQuery will execute the query statement.</p>
			<p>In this section, we've analyzed all the main features available in the BigQuery web interface. Now, we<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> can start exploring the <strong class="bold">BigQuery public datasets</strong> and understand how to use them in our projects.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Exploring the BigQuery public datasets</h1>
			<p>Collecting large<a id="_idIndexMarker187"/> volumes of data is fundamental to developing machine learning use cases. This kind of activity is considered one of the most painful jobs in the data management field. In fact, it requires tools and best practices to regularly monitor and gather information from the physical world to<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> translate it into data. Thanks to the <strong class="bold">Cloud Public Datasets Program</strong>, we are allowed to use data that has already been collected and ingested into BigQuery.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">BigQuery public datasets</strong> are available in the <strong class="bold">Datasets</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Marketplace</strong> and are publicly available and ready to use for all GCP users. A list of all the datasets is<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> reachable at this URL: <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset">https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset</a>. The datasets are provided not only by Google but by large companies and public organizations that contribute to the maintenance of this multidisciplinary set of around 200 datasets. Some of the contributors are GitHub, NOAA, NASA, the City of Chicago, the University of Oxford, and the USA Department of Transportation.</p>
			<p>The public datasets are also directly accessible from the BigQuery UI. In the next few pages, we'll discover step by step what we should do to start using them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Searching for a public dataset</h2>
			<p>From the BigQuery <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>UI, we can select the <strong class="bold">Add Data</strong> button in the navigation menu and then click on <strong class="bold">Explore public datasets</strong> to open an overlay window that will show the BigQuery public datasets divided by category of interest.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see some BigQuery public datasets:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – The BigQuery public datasets embedded view in the main BigQuery UI</p>
			<p>From this screen, you can scroll up and down to explore the available datasets, use the search bar to look for a specific topic, or use the <strong class="bold">Category</strong> menu to filter the topics.</p>
			<p>For our purposes, we'll look for the open data related to <strong class="bold">Chicago Taxi Trips</strong>, published by the City of Chicago. To find this dataset, the suggestion is to search the keywords Chicago taxi and select the only item that will appear with the name <strong class="bold">Chicago Taxi Trips</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see a description of the dataset:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – The Chicago Taxi Trips public dataset overview, accessible from the Google Cloud Marketplace</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> section, the dataset is described, and additional information is provided on the right. In <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>this particular case, we can read that the dataset is updated monthly and is published on the Chicago Data Portal.</p>
			<p>Upon clicking the <strong class="bold">View Dataset</strong> button, we'll be redirected to the BigQuery UI where we can access the <strong class="source-inline">bigquery-public-data</strong> project. Browsing this GCP project, you'll find the <strong class="source-inline">chicago_taxi_trips</strong> dataset, which contains only one table: <strong class="source-inline">taxi_trips</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Analyzing a table</h2>
			<p>Clicking on the<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> table name will enable you to go deeper into some aspects of the <strong class="source-inline">taxi_trips</strong> data. In the <strong class="bold">Schema</strong> tab, we can explore what the fields that compose the selected table are. Some columns are defined as <strong class="bold">REQUIRED</strong> and others are <strong class="bold">NULLABLE</strong>. Thanks to the publisher of the dataset, this table is also well documented, and we can read a short description of each field. This kind of information will help us during the first stages of the implementation of a new use case before building a machine learning model:</p>

			<p>To deep dive into the <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>technical details of the table, we can move to the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> tab. This section shows relevant information such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The table size in GB.</li>
				<li>The number of rows in the table.</li>
				<li>The creation date of the table and also the last time that it was updated.</li>
				<li>The BigQuery region in which the table is stored. In this case, the data is stored in the multi-region US. <p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Number of Rows</strong> and<strong class="bold"> Last Modified Date </strong>give fundamental information for machine learning purposes. To train effective models, we need to be sure that we have enough records and that those records aren't obsolete. Using an insufficient number of records or old data can produce low-quality machine learning models.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> tab gives us the last available information that we can gather from the table. This functionality allows us to take a view of a sample of data stored in the table and understand the content at a glance.</p>
			<p>In the following <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>screenshot, you can visualize the records of the table using the <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> feature:</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Accessing information from the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> and <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> tabs doesn't impact the billing of your project. To get the count of the records in a table, we suggest you use <strong class="bold">Number of Rows</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> tab instead of performing a <strong class="source-inline">SELECT COUNT(*)</strong> query. To view a sample of the records, it is recommended to use the <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> function in place of executing <strong class="source-inline">SELECT *</strong> on the table.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Throughout this second chapter, we've taken the first steps into GCP. Before starting the registration process, we look at the hierarchy of GCP resources, composed of multiple projects, folders, and an organization node. </p>
			<p>After that, we learned how to create a new account and leverage the free trial offered by Google. Then, we explored Google Cloud Console from the web browser and created a new GCP project that we'll use in the next chapters to host our machine learning use cases.</p>
			<p>Upon completing the setup operations, we enabled the BigQuery API to start accessing this serverless analytic data warehouse.</p>
			<p>Since BigQuery provides a lot of different functions, we introduced each of them gradually, exploring their utility. One of the most important functions is adding public datasets to our console. This capability enables us to access and use tables that have already been compiled by companies and public institutions. The datasets are ready to use and can be leveraged to develop our use cases.</p>
			<p>For this chapter, we focused on a table with information about taxi trips, published by the City of Chicago. This table offered us the opportunity to explore the technical details of a table and how to preview the data in it.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will write our first SQL statements to become confident with all the basic operations that will be extremely valuable during the development of machine learning models.</p>
