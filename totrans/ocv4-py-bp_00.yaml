- en: The goal of this book is to get you hands-on with a wide range of intermediate
    to advanced projects using the latest version of the **OpenCV 4** framework and
    the **Python 3.8** language instead of only covering the core concepts of computer
    vision in theoretical lessons.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This updated second edition has increased the depth of the concepts we tackle
    with OpenCV. It will guide you through working on independent hands-on projects
    that focus on essential computer vision concepts such as image processing, 3D
    scene reconstruction, object detection, and object tracking. It will also cover,
    with real-life examples, statistical learning and deep neural networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will begin by understanding concepts such as image filters and feature matching,
    as well as using custom sensors such as the **Kinect depth sensor**. You will
    also learn how to reconstruct and visualize a scene in 3D, how to align images,
    and how to combine multiple images into a single one. As you advance through the
    book, you will learn how to recognize traffic signs and emotions on faces and
    detect and track objects in video streams using neural networks, even if they
    disappear for short periods of time.

- en: By the end of this OpenCV and Python book, you will have hands-on experience
    and be proficient at developing your own advanced computer vision applications
    according to specific business needs. Throughout the book, you will explore multiple
    machine learning and computer vision models such as **Support Vector Machines** (**SVMs**)
    and convolutional neural networks.

    a number of interesting image filters (such as a black-and-white pencil sketch,
    warming/cooling filters, and a cartoonizer effect), and we''ll apply them to the
    video stream of a webcam in real time.'

    hand gestures in real time using the output of a depth sensor, such as Microsoft

    an arbitrary object of interest in the video stream of a webcam, even if the object
    is viewed from different angles or distances, or under partial occlusion.'

    in 3D by inferring its geometrical features from camera motion.'

    Photography with OpenCV*, helps you develop command-line scripts that take images
    as input and produce panoramas or **High Dynamic Range** (**HDR**) images. The
    scripts will either align the images so that there is a pixel-to-pixel correspondence
    or stitch them creating a panorama, which is an interesting application of image
    alignment. In a panorama, the two images are not that of a plane but that of a
    3D scene. In general, 3D alignment requires depth information. However, when the
    two images are taken by rotating the camera about its optical axis (as in the
    case of panoramas), we can align two images of a panorama.'

    with deep convolutional neural networks. You will modify a classifier network

    a Keras model on a dataset and how to serialize and save your Keras model to a
    disk. You will then see how to classify new input images using your loaded Keras
    model. You will train a convolutional neural network using the image data you

    systems, such as **Windows**, **GNU Linux**, **macOS**, and others. We have made

    can be installed using `pip` (Python's dependency management system). If you have
    trouble getting any of these working, we have Dockerfiles available with which
