- en: Data-driven decision-making has been the key to the success of any business,
    and **Machine Learning** (**ML**) plays a key role in achieving that and helping
    businesses stay ahead of the competition. Though ML helps in unlocking the true
    potential of a business, there are many obstacles along the way. According to
    a study, 90 percent of ML models never make it to production. The disconnect between
    model development and productionization as well as bad or mediocre ML practices
    are a few of the many reasons for this. This is why there are so many end-to-end
    ML platforms offering to make ML development easy. One of the primary goals of
    these platforms is to encourage data scientists/ML engineers to follow **Machine
    Learning Operations** (**MLOps**) standards that help in the faster productionization
    of a model. In recent years, feature management has been one of the aims of the
    ML platform – whether it is built in-house or offered as a **Platform as a Service**
    (**PaaS**). A feature store that provides the ability to create, share, and discover
    curated ML features has become an integral part of most of these ML platforms.

- en: The aim of this book is to discuss the significance of a feature store in ML
    pipelines. Hence, we will start with an ML problem and try to develop a model
    without a feature store. We will then discuss what aspects of ML can benefit from
    a feature store and how a few capabilities of feature stores not only help in
    creating better ML practices but also help in the faster and more cost-effective
    development of the model. As we move from *why* we should use a feature store
    to the *what?* and *how?* aspects of it, we will go through feature engineering,
    model training, inference, and also productionization of batch and online models
    with practical examples. In the first and second sections of the book, we will
    use an open source feature store, Feast. In the last section, we will look for
    alternatives that are available on the market and also try out an end-to-end use
    case with a managed feature store.

- en: This book is for data/ML/platform engineers, data scientists, and also data
    science enthusiasts who want to learn about feature management, how to deploy
    Feast on the AWS cloud, how to create curated ML features, and how to use and
    collaborate with other data scientists in model building, using a feature store
    for batch and online model prediction, as well as moving a model from development
    to production. This book will be beneficial to ML projects that range from small
    university projects to enterprise-level ML applications.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18024_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *An Overview of the Machine
    Learning Life Cycle*, starts with a small introduction to ML and then dives deep
    into an ML use case – a customer lifetime value model. The chapter runs through
    the different stages of ML development, and finally, it discusses the most time-consuming
    parts of ML and also what an ideal world and the real world look like in ML development.'

    Stores Solve?*, introduces us to the main focus of the book, which is feature
    management and feature stores. It discusses the importance of features in production
    systems, different ways to bring features into production, and common issues with
    these approaches, followed by how a feature store can overcome these common issues.'

    Terminology, and Usage*, starts with an introduction to an open source feature
    store – Feast – followed by installation, different terminology used in the feature
    store world, and basic API usage. Finally, it briefly introduces different components
    that work together in Feast.'

    to ML Models*, will help readers install Feast on AWS as it goes through the different
    resource creations, such as S3 buckets, a Redshift cluster, and the Glue catalog,
    step by step with screenshots. Finally, it revisits the feature engineering aspect
    of the customer lifetime value model developed in [*Chapter 1*](B18024_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014),
    *An Overview of the Machine Learning Life Cycle*, and creates and ingests the

    *Adding Feature Store to ML Models*, and discusses how a feature store can help
    data scientists and ML engineers collaborate in the development of an ML model.

    model training, and inference code/notebooks built in the previous chapters, and
    deploys the batch and online model pipelines into production. Finally, it discusses
    aspects beyond production, such as feature monitoring, changes to feature definitions,

    Feature Store, Google Cloud''s Vertex AI, Hopsworks Feature Store, and Amazon
    SageMaker Feature Store. It also introduces the basic usage of the latter so that
    users can get the gist of what is it like to use a managed feature store. Finally,

- en: The book uses AWS services for Feast deployment, pipeline orchestration, and
    a couple of SageMaker offerings. If you create a new AWS account, all the services
    used are under free-tier or featured products, except the Managed Workflows for
    Apache Airflow (MWAA) environment. However, we have listed alternatives for Airflow
    installation that can be used for running the examples.
  prefs: []

- en: All the examples are run using Python 3.7 – `feast==0.19.3`. The appropriate
    library versions are also mentioned in the notebooks wherever necessary. To run
    through the examples, all you need is a Jupyter notebook environment (local, Google
    Colab, SageMaker, or another of your choice) and the mentioned AWS resources and
    permissions for each chapter or section.
