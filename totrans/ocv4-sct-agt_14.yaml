    OpenCV's Python bindings, as instructed in [Chapter 1](e3ac8266-975b-43ca-8221-482a15eb0e05.xhtml),
    *Preparing for the Mission*. Now, if you are new to Python, you are probably wondering
    how to test this environment and run Python code.

    silently. On the other hand, if you see an error, you should go back and review
    the setup steps. If the error says, `ImportError: No module named ''cv2''`, this
    suggests that Python did not find the `cv2.pyd` file (the OpenCV Python module)
    in Python''s `site-packages` folder. On Windows, if the error says, `ImportError:
    DLL load failed`. This suggests that Python succeeded in finding the `cv2.pyd`
    file, but failed to find one of the module''s DLL dependencies, such as one of
    the OpenCV DLLs or (in a custom build using TBB) the TBB DLL; perhaps the folder
    containing the DLL is missing from the system''s `Path`.'

    file) with a `__main__` section in the code, Python can execute this script if
    you pass it as an argument to the Python interpreter. For example, let''s suppose
    that we want to run the `Luxocator.py` script from [Chapter 2](4ec4e82a-b63d-4fc1-bf3b-47c653c25a79.xhtml),
    *Searching for Luxury Accommodations Worldwide*. At the operating system''s Terminal

    will suffice, and minimalists may prefer it. Alternatively, a variety of dedicated
    Python editors and IDEs offer features such as autocompletion. I sometimes use
    a text editor and other times an IDE called **PyCharm** ([https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)),
    which has a free community edition.

    code. This book does not include a guide to the Python language per se, although,
    certainly, the book's projects can help you learn Python (and other languages)
    by example. If you want to supplement your reading of this book with a more language-focused
    resource, you can find many options in the official *Python For Beginners* guide
    at [https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/),
