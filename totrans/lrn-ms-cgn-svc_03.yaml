    from the videos that you upload. These insights can be used to make videos (and
    by extension your content) more discoverable. They can also be used to improve
    user engagement.

    from Video Indexer to index each video. Indexing by (for example) spoken word
    or where two specific people are seen together can provide a much better search
    experience for users.'

    gained from Video Indexer. For example, you can deliver more relevant ads by using
    the video insights to present ads that are contextually correct. For instance,
    by using the insights, you can display ads for sports shoes in the middle of a
    football match instead of a swimming competition.'

    a video covering different material for 60 minutes, placing video moments over
    that time allows the user to jump straight to the relevant section.'

    is where a full video transcript comes from; however, breakdowns are mostly too
    detailed for users. Instead, you typically want to use summarized insights to
    obtain only the most relevant knowledge. If more detailed insights is required,
    you would go from the summarized insights to the full breakdowns.
