- en: This book has covered a broad and diverse set of problems in cybersecurity,
    along with novel and advanced machine learning solutions to tackle them. Security
    problems arise in every industry, be it social media, marketing, or information
    technology. While machine learning for cybersecurity is a hot topic, there are
    very few resources on how to break into this space. This final chapter covers
    how to do just that. First, we will look at a set of online resources that you
    can use to further your understanding of machine learning, cybersecurity, and
    their intersection. We will also look at a few interview questions that will test
    your knowledge and help you prepare for interviews. Finally, we will conclude
    by providing some additional project ideas that you can explore to build your
    portfolio.

    Andrew Ng is a professor of computer science at Stanford University. His machine
    learning course (made originally for Coursera) is world-famous. This course explains
    machine learning from the very basics, in clear and concise terms. You will learn
    about linear and logistic regression, gradient descent, and neural networks. The
    course explains the basics as well as the math behind it, with simple examples.
    All of the exercises in the course are in Matlab; however, you can try and implement
    them in Python for additional practice. (There is a Python version of the course
    as well, but I highly recommend that you do the Matlab version and implement it
    in Python by yourself, which will strengthen your Python coding skills.)'

- en: This chapter provided a comprehensive guide to breaking into the Sec-ML industry.
    It contains all the tools, tricks, and tips that you need to become a data scientist
    or ML practitioner in the domain of cybersecurity. We began by looking at a set
    of resources that you can leverage to study ML – both conceptually and hands-on.
    We also provided several references to books that will help you with the hands-on
    implementation of ML models in security-related fields. We also shared a question
    bank that contains commonly asked theory questions in data science interviews,
    followed by some conceptual, case study-based questions. While neither the resources
    nor the interview questions are exhaustive, they provide a good starting point.

    no use if you do not apply them to boost your portfolio. To facilitate this, four
    project blueprints were presented, along with helpful hints on implementation.
    We encourage you to follow through on these projects, build them on your own,
    and add them to your résumé.

    the fundamental concepts of ML and cybersecurity, and how the two come together.
    We looked at multiple problems in cybersecurity (such as malware detection, authorship
    obfuscation, fake news detection, and automated text detection) and applied novel
    methods to solve them (transformers, graph neural networks, and adversarial ML).
    We also looked at a closely related area, privacy, and covered how privacy-preserving
    mechanisms can be used in ML. Finally, this chapter tied everything together with
    interview questions and further project ideas.
