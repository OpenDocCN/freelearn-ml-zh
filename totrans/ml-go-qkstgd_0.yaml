- en: '**Machine learning** (**ML**) plays a vital part in the modern data-driven
    world, and has been extensively adopted in various fields across financial forecasting,
    effective searching, robotics, digital imaging in healthcare, and many more besides.
    It is a rapidly evolving field, with new algorithms and datasets being published
    every week, both by academics and technology companies. This book will teach you
    how to perform various machine learning tasks using Go in different environments.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will learn about many important techniques that are required to develop
    ML applications in Go, and deploy them as production systems. The best way to
    develop your knowledge is with hands-on experience, so dive in and start adding
    ML software to your own Go applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for developers and data scientists with at least a beginner-level
    knowledge of Go, and a vague idea of what types of problems ML aims to tackle.
    No advanced knowledge of Go, or a theoretical understanding of the mathematics
    that underpins ML, is required.

    Learning with Go*, introduces ML and the different types of ML-related problems.
    We will also look into the ML development life cycle, and the process of creating
    and taking an ML application to production.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](532d8304-b31d-41ef-81c1-b13f4c692824.xhtml), *Setting Up the Development
    Environment*, explains how to set up an environment for ML applications and Go.
    We will also gain an understanding of how to install an interactive environment,
    Jupyter, to accelerate data exploration and visualization using libraries such
    as Gota and gonum/plot.'

    algorithm, train it, and validate its predictive power on previously unseen data.'

    reuses many of the techniques related to data loading and preparation that we
    have implemented in this book, but will focuses instead on unsupervised machine
    learning.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](815e42bb-64e4-4f04-9dbd-c58af28f2580.xhtml), *Using Pretrained
    Models*, describes how to load a pretrained Go ML model and use it to generate
    a prediction. We will also gain an understanding of how to use HTTP to invoke
    ML models written in other languages, where they may reside on a different machine
    or even on the internet.'
