- en: Computer Vision is one of the popular areas in computer science that have gained
    widespread importance lately. Besides, the power of personal computers has grown,
    thus opening the gate for developers to use Computer Vision algorithms directly
    on end user machines using client-side scripting. Nowadays, the most popular programming
    language for the web is JavaScript. It allows us to develop complex algorithms
    and run them directly in a web browser; this solves several major problems—the
    user needs nothing but a browser to run a web application, and as a developer,
    you get a lower load on your server. In this book, we will provide a comprehensive
    overview of the most popular JavaScript libraries and discuss the techniques they
    provide to help you in your initial steps in exciting fields, such as image processing
    and Computer Vision. This book covers Computer Vision methods by providing an
    intuitive overview of each algorithm and showing clear examples of the usage of
    libraries.

- en: This book provides an overview of various methods in the Computer Vision area
    using JavaScript. Knowledge of JavaScript at the beginner level is required. It
    is totally fine if you know nothing about Computer Vision. However, you will need
    some basic math knowledge to understand the concepts in the book. To start with,
    you just need a web browser and your favorite text editor. This book will guide
    you from the basics of Computer Vision to the most complex algorithms in the JavaScript
    world.

- en: You will find this book interesting if you want a much easier way to use the
    power of Computer Vision in web applications. It will also be beneficial for those
    who want to implement a human interface on their websites, for example, to create
    a game. Even if you do not want to add the Computer Vision functionality to your
    website, take a look at what we have here—websites with Computer Vision algorithms
    will probably be a trend in the future. Even now you can benefit from using client-side
    scripting for Computer Vision—you will not need to buy extra machines for your
    backend.
