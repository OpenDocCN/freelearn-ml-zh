If a chapter does not have a specific OS requirement, then it will run on Windows, Linux, and Mac. As authors, we encourage you to take the latest master branch from the official GitHub repository (<a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/">https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/</a>) for setting up your OpenCV installation, rather then using the downloadable packages at the official OpenCV website (<a class="calibre1" href="http://opencv.org/downloads.html">http://opencv.org/downloads.html</a>), since the latest master branch contains a huge number of fixes compared to the latest stable release.</p><p class="calibre8">For hardware, the authors expect that you have a basic computer system setup, either a desktop or a laptop, with at least 4 GB of RAM memory available. Other hardware requirements are mentioned below.</p><p class="calibre8">The following chapters have specific requirements that come on top of the OpenCV 3 installation:</p><p class="calibre8"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Getting the Most out of Your Camera System" href="part0015_split_000.html#E9OE2-940925703e144daa867f510896bffb69">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre10">Getting the Most out of Your Camera System</em>:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre9">Software</strong>: OpenNI2 and FlyCapture 2.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre9">Hardware</strong>: PS3 Eye camera or any other USB webcam, an Asus Xtion PRO live or any other OpenNI-compatible depth camera, and a Point Grey Research (PGR) camera with one or more lenses.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre9">Remarks</strong>: The PGR camera setup (with FlyCapture 2) will not run on Mac.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04" class="calibre1"/>Basic installation guides</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">As authors, we acknowledge that installing OpenCV 3 on your system can sometimes be quite cumbersome. Therefore, we have added a series of basic installation guides for installing OpenCV 3, based on the latest OpenCV 3 master branch on your system, and getting the necessary modules for the different chapters to work. For more information, take a look at <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/OpenCVBlueprints/OpenCVBlueprints/tree/master/installation_tutorials">https://github.com/OpenCVBlueprints/OpenCVBlueprints/tree/master/installation_tutorials</a>.</p><p class="calibre8">Keep in mind that the book also uses modules from the OpenCV "contrib" (contributed) repository. The installation manual will have directions on how to install these. However, we encourage you to only install those modules that we need, because we know that they are stable. For other modules, this might not be the case.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05" class="calibre1"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">This book is ideal for you if you aspire to build computer vision systems that are smarter, faster, more complex, and more practical than the competition. This is an advanced book, intended for those who already have some experience in setting up an OpenCV development environment and building applications with OpenCV. You should be comfortable with computer vision concepts, object-oriented programming, graphics programming, IDEs, and the command line.</p></div>
