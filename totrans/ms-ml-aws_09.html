<p class="mce-root"><span>One of the main innovations in the field of AI and machine learning is the advent of deep learning algorithms. We dedicate this part of the book to deep learning algorithms and explain how readers can implement them using various technologies in AWS. We take a practical approach to explaining deep learning algorithms rather than a theoretical approach, and explain how deep learning works with help of several real-world examples. Readers will learn what deep learning is, the applications of deep learning, and how to implement deep learning systems on AWS.</span></p>
