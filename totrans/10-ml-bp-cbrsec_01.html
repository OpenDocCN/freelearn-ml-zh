			<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of cybersecurity and <span class="No-Break">machine learning!</span></p>
			<p>In the 21st century, rapid advancements in technology have brought about incredible opportunities for connectivity, convenience, and innovation. Half a century ago, it would have been hard to believe that you could speak to someone halfway across the world, or that a bot could write stories and poems for you. However, this digital revolution has also introduced new challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. With each passing day, individuals, businesses, and governments are becoming more reliant on digital systems, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats. As malicious actors grow more sophisticated, it is crucial to develop robust defenses to safeguard our sensitive information, critical infrastructure, <span class="No-Break">and privacy.</span></p>
			<p>Enter machine learning—a powerful branch of artificial intelligence that has emerged as a game-changer in the realm of cybersecurity. Machine learning algorithms have the unique ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make intelligent predictions. By leveraging this technology, cybersecurity professionals can enhance threat detection, distinguish normal behavior from anomalies, and mitigate risks in real time. Machine learning enables the development of sophisticated intrusion detection systems, fraud detection algorithms, and malware classifiers, empowering defenders to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning becomes increasingly crucial in safeguarding our digital assets and ensuring a secure and trustworthy future for individuals and <span class="No-Break">organizations alike.</span></p>
			<p>This book presents you with tools and techniques to analyze data and frame a cybersecurity problem as a machine learning task. We will cover multiple forms of cybersecurity, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">System security</strong>, which deals with malware detection, intrusion detection, and adversarial machine learning</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application security</strong>, which deals with detecting fake reviews, deepfakes, and fake news</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Privacy</strong> techniques such as federated machine learning and differential privacy</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Throughout the book, I have attempted to use multiple analytical frameworks such as statistical testing, regression, transformers, and graph neural networks. A strong understanding of these will allow you to analyze and solve a cybersecurity problem from <span class="No-Break">multiple approaches.</span></p>
			<p>As new technology is developed, malicious actors come up with new attack strategies. Machine learning is a powerful solution to automatically learn from patterns and detect novel attacks. As a result, there is a high demand in the industry for professionals having expertise at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning. This book can help you get started on this wonderful and <span class="No-Break">exciting journey.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for machine learning practitioners interested in applying their skills to solve cybersecurity issues. Cybersecurity workers looking to leverage ML methods will also find this book useful. An understanding of the fundamental machine learning concepts and beginner-level knowledge of Python programming are needed to grasp the concepts in this book. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced professional, this book offers a unique and valuable learning experience that’ll help you develop the skills needed to protect your network and data against the ever-evolving <span class="No-Break">threat landscape.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19327_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">On Cybersecurity and Machine Learning</em>, introduces you to the fundamental principles of cybersecurity and how it has evolved, as well as basic concepts in machine learning. It will also discuss the challenges and importance of applying machine learning to the <span class="No-Break">security space.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Detecting Suspicious Activity</em>, describes the basic cybersecurity problems: detecting intrusions and suspicious behavior that indicates attacks. It will cover statistical and machine learning techniques for <span class="No-Break">anomaly detection.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Malware Detection Using Transformers and BERT</em>, discusses malware and its variants. A state-of-the-art model, BERT, is used to frame malware detection as an NLP task to build a high-performance classifier with a small amount of malware data. The chapter also covers theoretical details on attention and the <span class="No-Break">transformer model.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Detecting Fake Reviews</em>, covers techniques for building models for fraudulent review detection. This chapter covers statistical analysis methods such as t-tests to determine which features are statistically different between real and fake reviews. Furthermore, it describes how regression can help model this data and how the results of regression should <span class="No-Break">be interpreted.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Detecting Deepfakes</em>, discusses deepfake images and videos, which have recently taken the internet by storm. The chapter covers how deepfakes are generated, the social implications they can have, and how machine learning can be used to detect deepfake images <span class="No-Break">and videos.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Detecting Machine-Generated Text</em>, extends deepfakes into the text domain and covers bot-generated text detection. It first outlines a methodology for generating a custom fake news dataset using GPT, followed by techniques for generating features, and finally, using machine learning to detect text that <span class="No-Break">is bot-generated.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor019"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Attributing Authorship and How to Evade it</em>, talks about the task of authorship attribution, which is important in social media and intellectual privacy domains. The chapter also explores the counter-task – that is, evading authorship attribution – and how that can be achieved to maintain privacy <span class="No-Break">when needed.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor020"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Detecting Fake News with Graph Neural Networks</em>, tackles an important issue in today’s world – that of misinformation and fake news.

			<p><a href="B19327_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Protecting User Privacy with Differential Privacy</em>, introduces users to differential privacy, a paradigm widely adopted in the technology industry. It also covers the fundamental concepts of privacy, both technical and legal. You will learn how to train fraud detection models in a differentially private manner, and the costs and benefits <span class="No-Break">it brings.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19327_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Protecting User Privacy with Federated Machine Learning</em>, covers a collaborative machine learning technique where multiple entities can co-train a model without having to share any training data. The chapter presents an example of how a deep neural network can be trained in a <span class="No-Break">federated fashion.</span></p>
