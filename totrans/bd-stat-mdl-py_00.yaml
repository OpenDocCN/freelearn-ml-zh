- en: Statistics is a discipline of study used for applying analytical methods to
    answer questions and solve problems using data, in both academic and industry
    settings. Many methods have been around for centuries, while others are much more
    recent. Statistical analysis and results are fairly straightforward for presenting
    to both technical and non-technical audiences. Furthermore, producing results
    with statistical analysis does not necessarily require large amounts of data or
    compute resources and can be done fairly quickly, especially when using programming
    languages such as Python, which is moderately easy to work with and implement.

- en: While artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced machine learning (ML) tools
    have become more prominent and popular over recent years with the increase of
    accessibility in compute power, performing statistical analysis as a precursor
    to developing larger-scale projects using AI and ML can enable a practitioner
    to assess feasibility and practicality before using larger compute resources and
    project architecture development for those types of projects.

    and provide basic predictive capabilities to analysts and data scientists alike.
    The reader will walk through the basic concepts and terminology required for understanding
    the statistical tools in this book prior to exploring the different tests and
    conditions under which they are applicable. Further, the reader will gain knowledge
    for assessing the performance of the tests. Throughout, examples will be provided
    in the Python programming language to get readers started understanding their
    data using the tools presented, which will be applicable to some of the most common
    questions faced in the data analytics industry. The topics we will walk through
    include:'
