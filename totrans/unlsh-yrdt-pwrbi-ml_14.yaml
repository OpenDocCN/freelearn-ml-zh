    to the cutting edge of technology, as you integrated OpenAI and Azure OpenAI into
    your Power BI project using the FAA Wildlife Strike data. Over the course of this
    book, you have walked through a project for ingesting raw data, transforming and
    prepping the data, building a BI solution for analytics, using analytics to discover
    data features for predictive ML models, building those ML models, scoring new
    data with the ML models, and adding new, robust descriptive and summarization
    capabilities to the solution using LLMs from OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. In *Chapters
    12* and *13*, you augmented and improved text using OpenAI, too. All of this was
    accomplished, from end to end, using Power BI.'

    and project, revise important key concepts, and then discover some suggestions
    for future iterations of the project and your career as a data professional. In
    the real world, most projects are never truly complete. At some point, they may
    end, but more often than not, there is the opportunity to improve upon the existing
    solution or expand the scope of the solution to provide more value. Understanding
    and articulating the outstanding value that can be captured by new iterations
    of work and communicating that message to stakeholders, along with estimates of
    the required investments, is key to building your projects to be bigger, better,
    and more impactful.

    leadership with tools to enable interactive analysis of the FAA Wildlife Strike
    data, in order to find insights about factors that influence incidents and make
    predictions about future possible wildlife strike incidents and associated costs.
    The primary goal of your project, predicting the future impact of FAA Wildlife
    Strikes, required building out Power BI ML models. Through the chapters of this
    book, you walked through the process, using content from the Packt GitHub repository,
    to plan out and implement an end-to-end project. Everything in this project was
    achieved using tools within Power BI or that were integrated with Power BI. A

    you probably will have found some style similarities between that course and this

    also using FAA Wildlife Strike data from the real world.
