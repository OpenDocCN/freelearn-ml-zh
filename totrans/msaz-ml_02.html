Then, you test and improve on it. Usually, this is an iterative process. Once you are happy with your model, you find ways so that it can be deployed for production and other people or applications can consume or make use of your developed model.</p><p>To perform the preceding tasks, you need an environment with the right tools available. ML Studio provides you with everything to develop and deploy a predictive model.</p><p>In this chapter, you will start exploring ML Studio after you know how to create a Microsoft account and a Azure ML workspace. Then, you will get introduced to different parts of ML Studio and learn how to create an experiment. You can also find out, briefly, how to work with other projects in ML Studio collaboratively. This chapter aims to familiarize you with the environment without doing any actual work, which is the content for the chapters following this one.</p><div class="section" title="Introduction to ML Studio"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec12"/>Introduction to ML Studio</h1></div></div></div><p>ML Studio <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>gives you an interactive visual workspace to easily build, test, and iterate a predictive analysis model.</p><p>You drag-and-drop datasets and analysis modules onto an interactive canvas, connecting them together to form an experiment, which you submit to ML Studio to run or execute. To iterate your model design, you edit the experiment, save a copy if desired, and submit it again.</p><p>There is no programming required for this; visually connecting datasets and modules to construct your predictive analysis model is enough. However, if you need more functionality than <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>what is available visually in ML Studio out of the box, you can write <span class="strong"><strong>R</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Python</strong></span> code<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> to get the desired result. R or Python programming is not an absolute must to work with ML Studio.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0792EN_02_01.jpg" alt="Introduction to ML Studio"/><div class="caption"><p>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/machine-learning-what-is-ml-studio/</p></div></div><p>Before you start working with ML Studio, you need to get a subscription for Microsoft Azure and sign in to ML Studio.

An experiment inside ML Studio is a collection of modules connected hierarchically. A module is a unit that encapsulates a machine learning library provided in ML Studio and performs a task common in machine learning scenarios. A dataset after it is uploaded to ML Studio is also available as a module to be used in an experiment. You just need to drag a module to the canvas of the experiment and visually join the output port of one to the input port of another to build the workflow for your model. A module may have one or more input ports or no input port at all. However, it must have at least one output port. You may think of a module as a block that may take inputs and generate a dataset per output port as output.</p><p>You can create more than one experiment in a workspace.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0792EN_02_05.jpg" alt="Experiments"/></div><div class="section" title="Creating and editing an experiment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec08"/>Creating and editing an experiment</h3></div></div></div><p>To create<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/> a new experiment, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>+ NEW</strong></span> button at the bottom of the left-hand side of the screen and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Blank Experiment</strong></span>.
