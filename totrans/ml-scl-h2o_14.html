			<p>In this section, we put on our enterprise stakeholder hats and learn how to plan for, deploy, administer, maintain, and secure the H2O at scale platform. You will first understand how Enterprise Steam works to integrate H2O with your enterprise server cluster and security environment. You will then learn how to configure Enterprise Steam to govern users and define the size of their H2O model-building environments, thereby controlling resource consumption and cost on your enterprise cluster. From there, we learn key areas of operations to support model building and deployment with H2O. Finally, we learn the details of H2O architecture and security from multiple architecture views. Data scientists are shown how these activities relate to their own needs. </p>
