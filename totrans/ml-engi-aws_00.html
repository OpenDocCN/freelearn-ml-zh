<p>There is a growing need for professionals with experience in working on machine learning (ML) engineering requirements as well as those with knowledge of automating complex <strong class="bold">MLOps</strong> pipelines in the cloud. This book explores a variety of AWS services, such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong>, <strong class="bold">AWS Glue</strong>, <strong class="bold">AWS Lambda</strong>, <strong class="bold">Amazon Redshift</strong>, and <strong class="bold">AWS Lake Formation</strong>, which ML practitioners can leverage to meet various data engineering and ML engineering requirements in production.</p>
<p>This machine learning book covers the essential concepts as well as step-by-step instructions that are designed to help you get a solid understanding of how to manage and secure ML workloads in the cloud. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll discover how to use several <strong class="bold">container</strong> and <strong class="bold">serverless</strong> solutions when training and deploying <strong class="bold">TensorFlow</strong> and <strong class="bold">PyTorch</strong> deep learning models on AWS. You’ll also delve into proven cost optimization techniques as well as data privacy and model privacy preservation strategies in detail as you explore best practices when using each AWS.</p>
<p>By the end of this AWS book, you'll be able to build, scale, and secure your own ML systems and pipelines, which will give you the experience and confidence needed to architect custom solutions using a variety of AWS services for ML engineering requirements.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for ML engineers, data scientists, and AWS cloud engineers interested in working on production data engineering, machine learning engineering, and MLOps requirements using a variety of AWS services such as <strong class="bold">Amazon EC2</strong>, <strong class="bold">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">EKS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Amazon SageMaker</strong>, <strong class="bold">AWS Glue</strong>, <strong class="bold">Amazon Redshift</strong>, <strong class="bold">AWS Lake Formation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">AWS Lambda</strong> -- all you need is an AWS account to get started.

<p><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Deep Learning Containers</em>, introduces AWS Deep Learning Containers and how they are used to help ML practitioners perform ML experiments faster using containers. Here, we will also deploy a trained deep learning model inside an AWS Lambda function using Lambda’s container image support.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Serverless Data Management on AWS</em>, presents several serverless solutions, such as Amazon Redshift Serverless and AWS Lake Formation, for managing and querying data on AWS.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Pragmatic Data Processing and Analysis</em>, focuses on the different services available when working on data processing and analysis requirements, such as AWS Glue DataBrew and Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">SageMaker Training and Debugging Solutions</em>, presents the different solutions and capabilities available when training an ML model using Amazon SageMaker. Here, we dive a bit deeper into the different options and strategies when training and tuning ML models in SageMaker.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">SageMaker Deployment Solutions</em>, focuses on the relevant deployment solutions and strategies when performing ML inference on the AWS platform.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Model Monitoring and Management Solutions</em>, presents the different monitoring and management solutions available on AWS.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Security, Governance, and Compliance Strategies</em>, focuses on the relevant security, governance, and compliance strategies needed to secure production environments. Here, we will also dive a bit deeper into the different techniques to ensure data privacy and model privacy.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Machine Learning Pipelines with Kubeflow on Amazon EKS</em>, focuses on using Kubeflow Pipelines, Kubernetes, and Amazon EKS to deploy an automated end-to-end MLOps pipeline on AWS.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Machine Learning Pipelines with SageMaker Pipelines</em>, focuses on using SageMaker Pipelines to design and build automated end-to-end MLOps pipelines. Here, we will apply, combine, and connect the different strategies and techniques we learned in the previous chapters of the book.</p>
