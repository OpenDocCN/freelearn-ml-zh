<p class="mce-root">The objective of this section is to introduce readers to machine learning in the context of AWS cloud computing and services. We expect our audience to have some basic knowledge of machine learning. However, we'll describe the nature of a typical successful machine learning project and the challenges often faced. We will provide an overview of the different AWS services and provide examples of typical machine learning pipelines, along with the key aspects to consider in order to create smart AI-powered products.</p>
