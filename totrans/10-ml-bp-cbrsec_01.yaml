- en: In the 21st century, rapid advancements in technology have brought about incredible
    opportunities for connectivity, convenience, and innovation. Half a century ago,
    it would have been hard to believe that you could speak to someone halfway across
    the world, or that a bot could write stories and poems for you. However, this
    digital revolution has also introduced new challenges, particularly in the realm
    of cybersecurity. With each passing day, individuals, businesses, and governments
    are becoming more reliant on digital systems, making them increasingly vulnerable
    to cyber threats. As malicious actors grow more sophisticated, it is crucial to
    develop robust defenses to safeguard our sensitive information, critical infrastructure,
    and privacy.

- en: Enter machine learning—a powerful branch of artificial intelligence that has
    emerged as a game-changer in the realm of cybersecurity. Machine learning algorithms
    have the unique ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and
    make intelligent predictions. By leveraging this technology, cybersecurity professionals
    can enhance threat detection, distinguish normal behavior from anomalies, and
    mitigate risks in real time. Machine learning enables the development of sophisticated
    intrusion detection systems, fraud detection algorithms, and malware classifiers,
    empowering defenders to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. As the digital
    landscape continues to evolve, the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning
    becomes increasingly crucial in safeguarding our digital assets and ensuring a
    secure and trustworthy future for individuals and organizations alike.

    behavior that indicates attacks. It will cover statistical and machine learning
    techniques for anomaly detection.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19327_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Malware Detection Using Transformers
    and BERT*, discusses malware and its variants. A state-of-the-art model, BERT,
    is used to frame malware detection as an NLP task to build a high-performance
    classifier with a small amount of malware data. The chapter also covers theoretical
    details on attention and the transformer model.'

    covers techniques for building models for fraudulent review detection. This chapter
    covers statistical analysis methods such as t-tests to determine which features
    are statistically different between real and fake reviews. Furthermore, it describes
    how regression can help model this data and how the results of regression should
    be interpreted.'
