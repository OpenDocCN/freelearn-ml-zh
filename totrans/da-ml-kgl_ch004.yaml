    mobile phone is probably a good idea. The technical specification of the environment

    portfolio (branding, audience reach, enabling a pitch to your potential employer
    etc.) but none of them matter if nobody can find them. Because Kaggle is part
    of Google, the notebooks are indexed by the most popular search engine in the
    world—so if someone is looking for a topic related to your code, it will show
    up in their search results.

    them apart). When writing this chapter, I tried to give it a try and lo and behold,
