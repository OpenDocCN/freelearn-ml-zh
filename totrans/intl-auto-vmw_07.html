<p class="mce-root">VMware has to deal with things in a fully automated fashion and requires machines that can make decisions. They are currently trying to figure out at least automatic initiation of the first remedial actions, and only if the machine doesn't respond or behave in an expected way is it then calling out for help. This is where the trend is heading today, as people innovate with machine learning techniques. VMware is gearing up for machine learning-based responses to the infrastructure and applications to be able to take action in relation to them and should not depend on any subsystem by precisely mentioning the impact on the system in real-time scenarios. We will learn about management toolsets, with a focus on machine learning techniques, in the next few chapters.</p>
