- en: Elastic Stack, previously known as the ELK Stack, is a log analysis solution
    that helps users ingest, process, and analyze search data effectively. With the
    addition of machine learning, a key commercial feature, the Elastic Stack makes
    this process even more efficient. This updated second edition of *Machine Learning
    with the Elastic Stack* provides a comprehensive overview of Elastic Stack's machine
    learning features for both time series data analysis as well as classification,
    regression, and outlier detection.

- en: The book starts by explaining machine learning concepts in an intuitive way.
    You'll then perform time series analysis on different types of data, such as log
    files, network flows, application metrics, and financial data. As you progress
    through the chapters, you'll deploy machine learning within the Elastic Stack
    for logging, security, and metrics. Finally, you'll discover how data frame analysis
    opens up a whole new set of use cases that machine learning can help you with.

- en: By the end of this Elastic Stack book, you'll have hands-on machine learning
    and Elastic Stack experience, along with the knowledge you need to incorporate
    machine learning into your distributed search and data analysis platform.

- en: If you're a data professional looking to gain insights into Elasticsearch data
    without having to rely on a machine learning specialist or custom development,
    then this Elastic Stack machine learning book is for you. You'll also find this
    book useful if you want to integrate machine learning with your observability,
    security, and analytics applications. Working knowledge of the Elastic Stack is
    needed to get the most out of this book.
