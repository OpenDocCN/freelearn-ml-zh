    assessed the output in comparison to the automated testing performed by Power
    BI during the training phase. The FAA Wildlife Strike database provided fresh
    data that was generated in the real world beyond the scope of the training and
    testing datasets. This data could potentially serve as a framework for scheduling
    the scoring of new data utilizing a Power BI ML model in collaboration with dataflows.
    The recently evaluated data produced outcomes that were relatively consistent
    with the expected results derived from the testing data.
