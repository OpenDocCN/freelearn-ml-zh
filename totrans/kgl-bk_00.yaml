- en: Having competed on Kaggle for over ten years, both of us have experienced highs
    and lows over many competitions. We often found ourselves refocusing our efforts
    on different activities relating to Kaggle. Over time, we devoted ourselves not
    just to competitions but also to creating content and code based on the demands
    of the data science market and our own professional aspirations. At this point
    in our journey, we felt that our combined experience and still-burning passion
    for competitions could really help other participants who have just started, or
    who would like to get inspired, to get hold of the essential expertise they need,
    so they can start their own journey in data science competitions.

- en: In short, we have written a book that demonstrates how to participate in competitions
    successfully and make the most of all the opportunities that Kaggle offers. The
    book is also intended as a practical reference that saves you time and effort,
    through its selection of many competition tips and tricks that are hard to learn
    about and find on the internet or on Kaggle forums. Nevertheless, the book doesn’t
    limit itself to providing practical help; it also aspires to help you figure out
    how to boost your career in data science by participating in competitions.

    We don’t explain in detail how linear regression or random forests or gradient
    boosting work, but how to use them in the best way and obtain the best results
    from them in a data problem. We expect solid foundations and at least a basic
    proficiency in data science topics and Python usage from our readers. If you are
    still a data science beginner, you need to supplement this book with other books
    on data science, machine learning, and deep learning, and train up on online courses,
    such as those offered by Kaggle itself or by MOOCs such as edX or Coursera.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Introducing Kaggle and Other Data Science Competitions*, discusses
    how competitive programming evolved into data science competitions. It explains
    why the Kaggle platform is the most popular site for these competitions and provides
    you with an idea about how it works.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Organizing Data with Datasets*, introduces you to Kaggle Datasets,
    the standard method of data storage on the platform. We discuss setup, gathering
    data, and utilizing it in your work on Kaggle.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Working and Learning with Kaggle Notebooks*, discusses Kaggle
    Notebooks, the baseline coding environment. We talk about the basics of Notebook
    usage, as well as how to leverage the GCP environment, and using them to build
    up your data science portfolio.'

    for certain kinds of problems strongly influence the way you can operate when
    building your model solution in a data science competition. The chapter also addresses
    the large variety of metrics available in Kaggle competitions.'
