<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">In this chapter, we will introduce basic concepts relating to ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">To understand these topics, a basic knowledge of algebra and mathematical modeling is needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">A working knowledge of the MATLAB environment is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">also required.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Introducing ML</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">ML is based on the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1"> idea of providing computers with a large amount of input data, together with the corresponding correct answers or labels, and allowing them to learn from this data, identifying patterns, relationships, and regularities within them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Unlike traditional programming approaches, in which computers follow precise instructions to perform specific tasks, ML allows machines to independently learn from data and make decisions based on statistical models </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">and predictions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">One of the key concepts of ML is the ability to generalize. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">This means that a model trained on information in the training dataset should be able to make accurate predictions about new data that it has never seen before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">This allows ML to be applied across a wide range </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">of domains.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">How to define ML</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">To better understand the basic concepts of ML, we can start from the definitions formulated by the pioneers in this field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">According to Arthur L. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Samuel (1959) – “ML is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">explicitly programmed.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">The definition mentioned refers to the ability to learn from experience, which humans do in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">most cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">ML is an interdisciplinary domain forged at the crossroads and harmonious blending of computer science, statistics, neurobiology, and control theory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Its practical applications have successfully surmounted various challenges across diverse fields, fundamentally altering the paradigm of software development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">In essence, ML constitutes a foundational approach that empowers computers with a degree of autonomy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">It is evident that ML draws its inspiration from the study of human learning; just as the human brain and its neurons underlie intuition, artificial neural networks serve as the bedrock for computer decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">ML facilitates the creation of models that can accurately depict data patterns through a meticulous analysis </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">of datasets.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">As an illustration, we can establish a connection between input variables and output variables within a given system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">One approach to achieving this is by assuming the existence of a mechanism for generating parametric data, albeit without precise knowledge of the parameter values. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">This procedure is commonly referred to as employing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">statistical</span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> methods.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Analysis of logical reasoning</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Logical reasoning is based on the concepts of induction, deduction, and inference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Here are the differences</span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">between them:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Induction</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> is a reasoning process that starts from specific observations or data to arrive at general conclusions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">In other words, it is about extracting a general rule or principle based on specific examples. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Induction can be useful for making predictions and generalizations, but the conclusions obtained are not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">necessarily certain.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Deduction</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> is a reasoning process that starts from general premises or rules and arrives at specific conclusions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">In other words, it is about applying general principles to obtain specific information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">The deduction is based on formal logic and the use of valid inference rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">The deduction produces logically correct conclusions from the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">given premises.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Finally, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">inference</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> is a reasoning process that leads us to draw conclusions, deductions, or judgments based on available evidence or information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Inference can involve both induction and deduction as well as other forms of reasoning, such as abduction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Inference can be viewed as the application of reasoning rules or strategies to obtain new information or arrive at conclusions based on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">existing ones.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">In summary, induction is based on extracting general principles from specific examples, deduction is based on applying general principles to obtain specific conclusions, while inference is a broader term that encompasses both induction and deduction, as well as other </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">reasoning processes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">In the realm of ML, the teacher and the learner are two pivotal entities that play significant roles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">The teacher possesses the necessary knowledge to execute a given task, while the learner’s objective is to acquire that knowledge to perform the task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">The strategies employed for learning can be distinguished based on the level of inference carried out by the learner, considering two extremes: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">no inference</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">substantial inference</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">When a computer system (the learner) is directly programmed, it acquires knowledge without engaging in any inference, as all cognitive processes are handled by the programmer (the teacher). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Quite the opposite, when a system finds new solutions autonomously, it necessitates a substantial amount of inference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">In this scenario, organized knowledge is derived through experiments and observations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.4">In the following figure, the difference</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> between induction and deduction for inference tasks </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">is shown.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">In between induction and deduction is a midpoint called inference – for example, say a student seeks to work out a math challenge by drawing analogies to solutions provided in a workbook. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">This activity demands inference, albeit to a lesser extent than the discovery of a new </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">mathematical theorem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">By increasing the learner’s capacity for inference, the drain on the teacher diminishes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">The following taxonomy </span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">of ML endeavors to portray the concept of trade-offs in terms of work demanded by both the learner and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">the teacher.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Learning strategy typologies</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Based on the inference </span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">performed, we can identify </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">different mechanisms that a learning system can adopt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Let’s see some </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">of them:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Rote learning</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">: Let’s start with a basic one, rote learning, which involves the use of content without any transformation being carried out on it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">No inference process is activated, and the knowledge is not processed in any way; it is essentially a memorization process programmed with considerable effort on the part of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">the learner.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Learning from instruction</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">: When acquiring knowledge from a teacher, the learner needs to convert the information presented into a format that can be internally processed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Additionally, it is crucial for the learner to integrate the new knowledge with their existing understanding to effectively utilize it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">This process involves some level of inference on the learner’s part, but a significant portion of the responsibility lies with the teacher. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">The teacher must present and organize the knowledge in a manner that progressively enhances the student’s existing knowledge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.5">This aligns with the approach used in most formal education methods. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.6">Consequently, the task of ML involves developing a system that can receive instruction or advice, store it, and apply the acquired </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">knowledge effectively.</span></span></li>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Learning by analogy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">: When acquiring new statements or skills, the process involves converting and enhancing existing knowledge that shares a strong resemblance to the new setting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">This allows the transformed knowledge to be effectively applied in the new context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">For example, a learning-by-analogy system could be utilized to transform code into something that implements a closely related function, even if it wasn’t originally designed for that purpose. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">Learning by analogy needs more inference on the part of the learner compared to the previous learning mechanism. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.5">The learner must retrieve a relevant fact or skill from their memory that is analogous in terms of relevant parameters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.6">Then, the retrieved knowledge needs to be converted, related to the new context, and archived for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">future use.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Learning from examples</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">: When confronted with a set of instances, including both examples that support an idea and counterexamples that contradict it, the learner infers a generalized description of the idea. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">This description encompasses all the positive examples while systematically removing the negative ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Learning from examples has been extensively studied in the field of artificial </span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">intelligence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">In this method, the learner</span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> engages in a higher degree of inference compared to learning from instruction, as there are no general ideas provided by a teacher. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">It also involves a slightly greater level of inference than learning by analogy since there are no related ideas provided as starting points for developing the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">new concept.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Learning from observation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">: This form of inductive learning is highly versatile and encompasses various tasks, such as discovery systems, theory formation, and establishing grouping principles for creating taxonomic hierarchies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Unlike other approaches discussed, this form of learning does not rely on an external teacher. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">Instead, the learner is required to engage in extensive inference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.4">They are not presented with a specific set of examples for a specific idea, nor do they have access to a prediction that can group instances produced in an automated way as positive or negative examples of any given concept. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.5">Furthermore, instead of focusing on a single idea, the learner must handle multiple concepts simultaneously, which introduces a significant challenge in terms of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">attention allocation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Learning by chunking</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">: This is a cognitive strategy that involves breaking down information into smaller, manageable units or “chunks” to enhance memory and comprehension. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">This technique capitalizes on the brain’s natural tendency to organize and process information in meaningful clusters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">By grouping related concepts together, learners can more easily absorb and retain complex material. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.4">Chunking is particularly effective in various educational settings, from memorizing lists and sequences to mastering intricate subjects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.5">When information is organized into cohesive chunks, it becomes easier to grasp the relationships between different components, facilitating a deeper understanding of the overall content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.6">This approach is especially beneficial in fields such as language acquisition, where breaking down phrases or words into manageable chunks aids in faster and more efficient learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.7">Moreover, chunking promotes efficient recall and problem-solving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.8">Instead of struggling to remember individual pieces of information, learners can access broader chunks of knowledge, leading to quicker and more accurate retrieval. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.9">This cognitive strategy aligns with the brain’s capacity to process information in parallel, optimizing the learning process and enhancing overall cognitive performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.10">In essence, learning by chunking empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of information with greater ease </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">and effectiveness.</span></span></li>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Unsupervised learning</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">: The algorithm tries to derive knowledge from a general input, without the help of a set of pre-classified examples, which is used to build descriptive models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">A typical example of the application of these algorithms is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">search engines.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">The underlying principle of all supervised learning algorithms is that with enough examples, an algorithm can create a derived function, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">B</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">, that approximates the desired function, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">A</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">If the approximation is accurate enough, the derived function should provide output answers like those of the desired function, making them acceptable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">These algorithms rely on the assumption that similar inputs correspond to similar outputs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.4">This assumption is often not perfectly met. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.5">However, there are situations where this approximation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">is acceptable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">With this type of learning, it is possible, for example, to use correctly labeled images of animals as input, to make the algorithm learn the correlation between the characteristics of a specific animal and the image containing it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">This is done in such a way that, subsequently, the algorithm can recognize it, given the input of an image containing that type of animal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">The algorithm learns to recognize a certain pattern to understand the correlation between the image and the assigned label, to then deduce a general rule with which to recognize whether the same correlation exists in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">subsequent data.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Unsupervised learning is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1"> commonly employed </span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">in clustering problems, where it identifies groups of data based on shared characteristics, resulting in the creation of data clusters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">Additionally, this approach is utilized in association learning, which involves identifying associative rules among the input data and in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">recommendation systems.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">A crucial aspect is the algorithm’s ability to interpret feedback as reinforcement rather than new input. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">The goal of reinforcement learning is to utilize received feedback to construct an optimal policy, maximizing the total expected reward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">A particular policy represents a particular update formula. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">Hence, learning the policy is equivalent to learning the update formula, and hence the optimization algorithm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.5">This approach allows training an algorithm without explicitly defining rules deduced from feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.6">It is particularly useful in complex domains where defining rules can be challenging, and performance can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">greatly improved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">Reinforcement learning</span><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1"> encompasses both </span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">passive learning and active learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">In passive learning, the agent follows a fixed policy and aims to learn the utilities of state-action pairs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">In some cases, the agent may also need to learn the model of the environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.4">In active learning, the agent must learn what actions to take and, through exploration, gain experience on how to behave within the environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.5">One way to implement this strategy is by having the algorithm play a game without providing it with the rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.6">Positive feedback is given when the agent takes allowed or beneficial actions, while negative feedback is provided for undesirable actions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.7">This allows the algorithm to learn optimal moves during the game without explicit knowledge of the game rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.8">The agent learns to behave successfully in its environment solely based on the received feedback and without </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">prior knowledge.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">The process begins with the supervised phase, where the labeled data is used to train a model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">This model learns to map the inputs to their corresponding outputs based on the provided labels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">Once the initial model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">unlabeled data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">During the unsupervised phase, the model uses the unlabeled data to extract patterns, structures, or relationships within the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">This can be done through techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, or generative modeling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">By leveraging the unlabeled data, the model can gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of the data and potentially improve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">its performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">The goal of semi-supervised learning is to use the knowledge gained from the labeled and unlabeled data to create a more robust and accurate model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">By combining the labeled data’s explicit guidance with the unsupervised learning’s ability to capture hidden patterns, semi-supervised learning can be a powerful approach, especially in scenarios where obtaining labeled data is expensive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">or time-consuming.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">The basic idea behind transfer learning is that the features learned by a model on one task can be useful for another task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">Instead of starting the learning process from scratch, transfer learning allows us to transfer the knowledge and representations acquired by the pre-trained model to the new task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.3">Using such an approach can lead to a substantial reduction in the required amount of training data and computational resources for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">new task.</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Feature extraction</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">: With this approach, the pre-trained model is used as a fixed feature extractor available for deep learning models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">The earlier layers of the pre-trained model are frozen, and only the later layers are replaced or modified to adapt to the new task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">The new data is passed through the pre-trained model, and the output features from the last few layers are extracted and used as input for a new classifier or model specific to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">new task.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">Transfer learning can be particularly effective when the pre-trained model has been trained on a large and diverse dataset, as it tends to learn generic features that are useful for a wide range of tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">By leveraging pre-existing knowledge, transfer learning enables faster training, better performance, and improved generalization on new tasks, especially when </span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">labeled data for the new task is limited </span><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">or unavailable.</span></span></p>
