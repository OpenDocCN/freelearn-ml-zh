- en: Julia is a powerful programming language that is designed to enable high-performance
    applications with developer productivity in mind. Its dynamic nature allows you
    to quickly perform small-scale experiments and then migrate to larger applications.
    Its introspection tools allow us to optimize performance by analyzing how high-level
    code is translated into lower-level instructions and machine code. Its metaprogramming
    facility helps more advanced programmers to build custom syntax for their specific
    domain usage. Its multiple dispatch and generic function features make it easy
    to build new capabilities by extending existing functions. For these and many
    more reasons, Julia is an excellent tool for developing applications across a
    wide spectrum of industries.

- en: This book fulfills several demands from Julia developers. *A desire to write
    better code. A desire to improve system performance. A desire to design software
    that is easy to maintain.* From the time that the Julia language was born to its
    magnificent milestone of version 1.0 in August 2018, many design patterns have
    already emerged from the brightest minds, ranging from the core developers of
    the language to heavy users of the language. At times, these patterns were presented
    in blog posts and conferences. Sometimes, they showed up in random discussion
    threads on the Julia Discourse forum. At other times, they come up in casual talks
    between community members on various Julia Slack channels. This book is a collection
    of patterns, documenting the best approaches to designing high-quality Julia applications.

    should be more knowledgeable about how to design and develop software in Julia.
    In addition, the material presented in this book can serve as a reference for
    any future discussions regarding design patterns in Julia. As we know from history,
    new design patterns will continue to emerge alongside the continuous evolution
    of the Julia language.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for beginner-to-intermediate Julia developers who want to get better
    at writing *idiomatic* Julia code for larger applications. It is not an introductory
    book, so you are expected to have some basic programming knowledge. If you are
    familiar with the object-oriented programming paradigm, then you may find this
    book helpful where it shows how the same problem can be solved differently, and
    often in a better way, in Julia.

- en: Many of the patterns described in this book are applicable to any industry domain
    and use cases. Whether you are a data scientist, researcher, system programmer,
    or enterprise application developer, you should be able to benefit from using
    these patterns in your projects.
