- en: This section concentrates on the *what?* and *how?* aspects of feature management
    in **Machine Learning** (**ML**). In this section, we will start with an introduction
    to an open source feature store, *Feast*, followed by different terminologies
    and basic API usage. We will reuse the same ML problem that we discussed in *Section
    1*, *Why Do We Need a Feature Store?*, create a Feast infrastructure on AWS, and
    include it in our ML pipeline. This inclusion enables us to look at how a feature
    store decouples our ML pipeline into different stages and the changes it brings
    to model training and inference. Once the model development is complete, we will
    look at how the capabilities of a feature store make it easy to move a model into
    production and also help in feature monitoring.
