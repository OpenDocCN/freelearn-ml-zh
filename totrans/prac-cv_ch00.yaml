- en: Computer vision is one of the most widely studied sub-fields of computer science.
    It has several important applications, such as face detection, image searching,
    and artistic image conversion. With the popularity of deep learning methods, many
    recent applications of computer vision are in self-driving cars, robotics, medicine,
    Virtual reality, and Augmented reality. In this book, a practical approach of
    learning computer vision is shown. Using code blocks as well as a theoretical
    understanding of algorithms will help in building stronger computer vision fundamentals.
    This book teaches you how to create applications using standard tools such as
    OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow. The various concepts and implementations explained
    in this book can be used across several domains, such as robotics, image editing
    apps, and self-driving cars. In this book, each chapter is explained with accompanying
    code and results to enforce the learning together.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for undergraduate students and professionals who want to get started
    with computer vision and gain with a practical knowledge of implementing several
    of these algorithms. This book assumes that readers have a basic knowledge of
    Python and computer programs, they can write and run Python scripts (including
    scientific Python), and they can understand linear algebra and basic mathematics
    for programming.

- en: This book will help readers in designing newer computer vision applications
    using image filtering, object detection, segmentation, tracking, and SLAM. Readers
    will understand the standard computer vision techniques used in the industry,
    as well as how to write their own code. Do the same as what with widely used libraries.
    They can use this to create their own applications across various domains, including
    image filtering, manipulating images, object detection, and advanced applications
    using deep learning. Readers will find a smooth transition from getting to know
    computer vision to using advanced techniques.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](prac-cv_ch01.html),* A Fast Introduction to Computer Vision,* gives
    a brief overview of what constitutes computer vision, its applications in different
    fields and subdivision of different type problems. The chapter also covers basic
    image input reading with code in OpenCV. There is also an overview of different
    color spaces and their visualizations.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](prac-cv_ch00.html), *Libraries, Development Platforms, and Datasets*, provides
    detailed instructions on how to set up a development environment and install libraries
    inside it. The various datasets introduced in this chapter include both that will
    be used in this book as well as currently popular datasets for each sub-domain
    of computer vision. The chapter includes links for downloading and loading wrappers
    to be used libraries such as Keras.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](prac-cv_ch03.html), *Image Filtering and Transformations in OpenCV*, explains
    different filtering techniques, including linear and nonlinear filters, their
    implementation in OpenCV. This chapter also includes techniques for transforming
    an image, such as linear translation, rotation around a given axis, and complete
    affine transformation. The techniques introduced in the chapter help in creating
    applications across several domains and enhancing image quality.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](prac-cv_ch04.html), *What is a Feature?* introduces the features
    and their importance in various applications in computer vision. The chapter consists
    of Harris Corner Detectors with basic features, the fast feature detector, and
    ORB features for both robust and fast features. There are also demonstrations
    in OpenCV of applications that use these. The applications include matching a
    template to the original image and matching two images of the same object. There
    is also a discussion of the black box feature and its necessity.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](prac-cv_ch05.html), *Convolutional Neural Networks*, begins with
    an introduction to simple neural networks and their components. The chapter also
    introduces convolutional neural networks in Keras with various components such
    as activation, pooling, and fully-connected. Results with parameter changes for
    each component are explained; these can be easily reproduced by the reader. This
    understanding is further strengthened by implementing a simple CNN model using
    an image dataset. Along with popular CNN architectures, VGG, Inception, and ResNet,
    there is an introduction to transfer learning. This leads to a look at state-of-the-art
    deep learning models for image classification.'

    an understanding of the image recognition problem. Detection algorithms, such
    as face detectors, are explained with OpenCV. You will also see some recent and
    popular deep learning-based object detection algorithms such as FasterRCNN, SSD,
    and others. The effectiveness of each of these is explained with TensorFlow object
    detection API on custom images.'

    parts. The first introduces the image instance recognition problem, with an implementation
    of the deep learning model for segmentation. The second part begins with an introduction
    to the MOSSE tracker from OpenCV, which is both efficient and fast. An introduction
    to the deep learning-based tracking of multiple objects is described in tracking.'

    from a geometrical point of view. Readers will first understand the challenges
    in computing depth from a single image, and later learn how to solve them using
    multiple images. The chapter also describes the way to track a camera pose for
    moving cameras using visual odometry. Lastly, the SLAM problem is introduced,
    with solutions presented using the visual SLAM technique, which uses only camera
    images as input.'
