- en: OpenCV 3 is a state-of-the-art computer vision library that is used for a variety
    of image and video processing operations. Some of the more spectacular and futuristic
    features, such as face recognition or object tracking, are easily achievable with
    OpenCV 3\. Learning the basic concepts behind computer vision algorithms, models,
    and OpenCV's API will enable the development of all sorts of real-world applications,
    including security and surveillance tools.

- en: Starting with basic image processing operations, this book will take you through
    a journey that explores advanced computer vision concepts. Computer vision is
    a rapidly evolving science whose applications in the real world are exploding,
    so this book will appeal to computer vision novices as well as experts of the
    subject who want to learn about the brand new OpenCV 3.0.0.
