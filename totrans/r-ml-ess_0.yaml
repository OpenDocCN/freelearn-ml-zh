- en: When facing a business problem, machine learning allows you to develop powerful
    and effective data-driven solutions. The recent explosion of data volume and sources
    increased the effectiveness of solutions based on data, so this field is becoming
    more and more valuable. Developing a machine learning solution has specific requirements,
    and there are some software and tools that support it. A very good option is to
    use R, which is an open source programming language for statistics supported by
    a wide international community. The R structure is projected for statistical analysis,
    and the international community develops the most cutting-edge solutions. For
    these reasons, R allows you to develop powerful machine learning solutions using
    just a few lines of code.

- en: There are machine learning tutorials, and they usually require some knowledge
    of the basics of statistics and computer science. This book is not just a tutorial.
    It doesn't even require a strong background in statistics or computer science.
    The target is not to provide you with a complete overview of all the techniques
    or to teach you how to build sophisticated solutions. This book is a path full
    of hands-on examples that provide you with the expertise to build a solution to
    a new problem. The aim is to show the most important concepts behind the approach
    in such a way that you have a deep understanding of machine learning and are able
    to identify and use the new algorithms.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for those who want to learn how to perform some machine
    learning using R, in order to gain insight from their data and to find the solution
    to some real-life problems. Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning
    but have never used R, or perhaps you know a little R but are new to machine learning.
    In either case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would be helpful
    to have a bit of familiarity with basic programming concepts, but no prior experience
    is required.
