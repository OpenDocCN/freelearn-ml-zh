    Learning*, covers machine learning, which is a branch of artificial intelligence
    that is based on the development of algorithms and mathematical models, capable
    of “learning” from data and autonomously adapting to improve their performance
    according to the objectives set. Thanks to this learning ability, machine learning
    is used in a wide range of applications, such as data analysis, CV, text translation,
    speech recognition, medical diagnosis, and financial risk prediction. Machine
    learning is an ever-evolving area of research and is revolutionizing many fields
    of science and industry. The aim of this chapter is to provide some introduction,
    background information, and a basic knowledge of MATLAB tools. In addition, the
    basic concepts of machine learning will be introduced.'

    looks at how to import and organize our data in MATLAB. Today, the amount of data
    generated is enormous; smartphones, credit cards, televisions, computers, home
    appliances, sensors, domestic systems, public and private transport, and so on
    are just a few examples of devices that generate data seamlessly. Such data is
    stored and then used for various purposes. One of these is data analysis using
    machine learning algorithms. To import and organize our data in MATLAB, you should
    familiarize yourself with the MATLAB workspace to make the operations as simple
    as possible. Then, we will analyze the different formats available for the data
    collected and how to move data in and out of MATLAB. We will also explore datatypes
    to work with grouping variables and categorical data and how to export data from
    the workspace, including cell array, structure array, and tabular data, and save
    it in a MATLAB-supported file format. Finally, we will understand how to organize
    data in the correct format for the next phase of data analysis.'

    and Regression*, shows us how to classify an object using nearest neighbors and
    how to perform an accurate regression analysis in a MATLAB environment. Classification
    algorithms return accurate predictions based on our observations. Starting from
    a set of predefined class labels, the classifier assigns each input data a class
    label, according to the training model. Regression relates a set of independent
    variables to a dependent variable. Through this technique, it is possible to understand
    how the value of the dependent variable changes as the independent variable varies.'

    Reduction*, explores clustering methods, which are designed to find hidden patterns
    or groupings in a dataset. These algorithms identify a grouping without any label
    to learn from through the selection of clusters, based on the similarity between
    the elements. Dimensionality reduction is the process of converting a set of data
    with many variables into data with lesser dimensions but ensuring similar information.
    Feature selection approaches try to find a subset of the original variables. Feature
    extraction reduces the dimensionality of the data by transforming it into new
    features. This chapter shows us how to divide the data into clusters, or groupings
    of similar items. We’ll also learn how to select a feature that best represents
    the dataset.'

    Networks Modeling*, delves into **artificial neural networks** (**ANNs**), which
    include data structures and algorithms for the learning and classification of
    data. Through the neural network techniques, a program can learn by example and
    create an internal structure of rules to classify different inputs. MATLAB provides
    algorithms, pretrained models, and apps to create, train, visualize, and simulate
    ANNs. In this chapter, we will see how to use MATLAB to build an ANN-based model
    to predict values and classify data.'

    Neural Networks*, examines deep learning, which is a machine learning technology
    based on multilayer ANNs and has allowed many applications to reach a high degree
    of accuracy. Deep neural networks are capable of modeling complex relationships
    between input and output data. Among the most successful applications is computer
    vision, with tasks that include classification, image regression, and object detection.
    For example, a deep neural network is able to generate a layered representation
    of objects in which each object is identified by a set of characteristics that
    has the form of visual primitives, such as particular edges, oriented lines, textures,
    and recurring patterns. Convolutional networks are characterized by convolutional
    layers, which use filters to analyze data in a local region and produce an activation
    map. These activation maps are then processed by pooling layers, which aggregate
    the low-resolution data to reduce the dimensionality of the representation and
    make processing more computationally efficient. The convolutional and pooling
    layers are then alternated several times until an image is represented by a low-resolution
    activation map. In this chapter, we will learn the basic concepts of deep learning
    and discover how to implement an algorithm based on convolutional networks in
    the MATLAB environment.'

    Using MATLAB*, explores **natural language processing** (**NLP**), which automatically
    processes information conveyed through spoken or written language. This task is
    fraught with difficulty and complexity, largely due to the innate ambiguity of
    human language. To enable machine learning and interaction with the world in ways
    typical of humans, it is essential not only to store data but also to teach machines
    how to translate it simultaneously into meaningful concepts. As natural language
    interacts with the environment, it generates predictive knowledge. In this chapter,
    we will learn the basic concepts of NLP and how to build a model to label sentences.'

    to process, analyze, and understand the contents of visual data. In image content
    analysis, we use a lot of computer vision algorithms to build our understanding
    of the objects in an image. Computer vision covers various aspects of image analysis,
    such as object recognition, shape analysis, pose estimation, 3D modeling, and
    visual search. Humans are good at identifying and recognizing things around them!
    The goal of computer vision is to accurately model the human vision system using
    computers. In this chapter, we will understand the basic concepts of computer
    vision and how to implement a model for object recognition, using MATLAB.'

    Forecasting with MATLAB*, delves into time series data, which is basically a sequence
    of measurements that are collected over time. These measurements are taken with
    respect to a predetermined variable and at regular time intervals. One of the
    main characteristics of time series data is that the ordering matters. The list
    of observations that we collect is ordered on a timeline, and the order in which
    they appear says a lot about underlying patterns. If you change the order, this
    will totally change the meaning of the data. Sequential data is a generalized
    notion that encompasses any data that comes in a sequential form, including time
    series data. In this chapter, we will learn the basic concepts of sequential data
    and how to build a model that describes the pattern of the time series or any
    sequence in general.'

    Systems*, examines the recommendation engine, which is a model that can predict
    what a user may be interested in. When we apply this to the context of movies,
    for example, this becomes a movie recommendation engine. We filter items in our
    database by predicting how the current user might rate them. This helps us in
    connecting the user to the right content in our dataset. Why is this relevant?
    If you have a massive catalog, then the user may or may not find all the content
    that is relevant to them. By recommending the right content, you increase consumption.
    Companies such as Netflix heavily rely on recommendations to keep the user engaged.
    In this chapter, we will learn the basic concepts of recommender systems and how
    to build a movie recommendations system, using MATLAB.'

    teaches you the basic concepts of an anomaly detection system and how to implement
    one in MATLAB. A physical system, in its life cycle, can be subject to failures
    or malfunctions that can compromise its normal operation. It is, therefore, necessary
    to introduce an anomaly detection system within the capability of preventing critical
    interruptions. This is called a fault diagnosis system and can identify the possible
    presence of a malfunction within the monitored system. The search for the fault
    is one of the most important and qualifying maintenance intervention phases, and
    it is necessary to act in a systematic and deterministic way. To carry out a complete
    search for the fault, it is necessary to analyze all the possible causes that
    may have determined it.'
