- en: The .NET Framework is one of the most successful application frameworks in history.
    Literally billions of lines of code have been written on the .NET Framework, with
    billions more to come. For all of its success, it can be argued that the .NET
    Framework is still underrepresented for data science endeavors. This book attempts
    to help address this issue by showing how machine learning can be rapidly injected
    into the common .NET line of business applications. It also shows how typical
    data science scenarios can be addressed using the .NET Framework. This book quickly
    builds upon an introduction to machine learning models and techniques in order
    to build real-world applications using machine learning. While by no means a comprehensive
    study of predictive analytics, it does address some of the more common issues
    that data scientists encounter when building their models.

- en: Many books about machine learning are written with every chapter centering around
    a dataset and how to implement a model on that dataset. While this is a good way
    to build a mental blueprint (as well as some code boilerplate), this book is going
    to take a slightly different approach. This book centers around introducing the
    same application for the line of business development and one common open data
    dataset for the scientific programmer. We will then introduce different machine
    techniques, depending on the business scenario. This means you will be putting
    on different hats for each chapter. If you are a line of business software engineer,
    Chapters 2, 3, 6, and 9 will seem like old hat. If you are a research analyst,
    Chapters 4, 7, and 10 will be very familiar to you. I encourage you to try all
    chapters, regardless of your background, as you will perhaps gain a new perspective
    that will make you more effective as a data scientist. As a final note, one word
    you will not find in this book is "simply". It drives me nuts when I read a tutorial-based
    book and the author says "it is simply this" or "simply do that". If it was simple,
    I wouldn't need the book. I hope you find each of the chapters accessible and
    the code samples interesting, and these two factors can help you immediately in
    your career.

    the business that we will use in this book—AdventureWorks Bicycle company. We
    will then look at a business problem where customers are dropping orders based
    on reviews of the product. It looks at creating a linear regression by hand, using
    Math.NET and Accord.NET to solve this business problem. It then adds this regression
    to the line of business application.'

    looks at creating a multiple linear regression and a logistic regression to solve
    different business problems at AdventureWorks. It will look at different factors
    that affect bike sales and then categorize potential customers into potential
    sales or potential lost leads. It will then implement the models to help our website
    convert potential lost leads into potential sales.'

    Up the Wrong Tree?*, takes a break from AdventureWorks. You will put on your data
    scientist hat, use an open dataset of traffic stops, and see if we can understand
    why some people get a verbal warning and why others get a ticket at a traffic
    stop. We will use basic summary statistics and decision trees to help in understanding
    the results.'

    introducing datasets and machine learning models and concentrates on one of the
    hardest parts of machine learning—obtaining and cleaning the data. We will look
    at using F# type providers as a very powerful language feature that can vastly
    speed up this process of "data munging".'

    machine learning classification models, k-NN and Naïve Bayes, to see which is

    more recent problem—how to build machine learning models on top of data that is
    characterized by massive volume, variability, and velocity. We will then look
    at how IoT devices can generate this big data and how to deploy machine learning

- en: The lines between business computing and scientific computing are becoming increasingly
    blurred. Indeed, an argument can be made that the distinction was never really
    as clear as it has been made out to be in the past. With that, machine learning
    principles and models are making their way into mainstream computing applications.
    Consider the Uber app that shows how far Uber drivers are from you, and product
    recommendations built into online retail sites such as Jet.

    when the cliché of *ours is a changing industry* was being thrown around, it was
    about languages (need to know JavaScript, C#, and TSql) and frameworks (Angular,
    MVC, WPF, and EF). Now, the cliché means that the software developer needs to
    know how to make sure their code is correct (test-driven development), how to
    get their code off of their machine onto the customer's machine (DevOps), and
    how to make their applications smarter (machine learning).

- en: Also, the same forces that are pushing the business developer to retool are
    pushing the research analyst into unfamiliar territory. Earlier, analysts focused
    on data collection, exploration, and visualization in the context of an application
    (Excel, PowerBI, and SAS) for point-in-time analysis. The analyst would start
    with a question, grab some data, build some models, and then present the findings.
    Any kind of continuous analysis was done via report writing or just re-running
    the models. Today, analysts are being asked to sift through massive amounts of
    data (IoT telemetry, user exhaust, and NoSQL data lakes), where the questions
    may not be known beforehand. Also, once models are created, they are pushed into
    production applications where they are continually being re-trained in real time.
    No longer just a decision aid for humans, research is being done by computers
    to impact users immediately.

- en: The newly-minted data scientist title is at the confluence of these forces.
    Typically, no one person can be an expert on both sides of the divide, so the
    data scientist is a bit of a *jack of all trades, master of none* who knows machine
    learning a little bit better than all of the other software engineers on the team
    and knows software engineering a little bit better than any researcher on the
    team. The goal of this book is to help move from either software engineer or business
    analyst to data scientist.
