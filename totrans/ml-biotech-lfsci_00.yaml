- en: We have seen major changes in the field of machine learning in the last few
    years that have impacted our daily lives and the way business decisions are made.
    If there is one thing that the biotechnology and life sciences industries have
    in abundance, it is their never-ending sources of data. As we move toward more
    data-driven models, the intersection of life sciences and machine learning has
    seen unprecedented growth, uncovering vast quantities of information and hidden
    patterns giving companies major competitive advantages.

- en: Over the course of this book, we will touch on some of the most important elements
    of machine learning from both a supervised and unsupervised perspective. We will
    not only learn to develop and train robust models, but also deploy them in the
    cloud using AWS and GCP, allowing us to make them immediately available for end
    users.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book specifically caters to scientific professionals in both academia and
    industry looking to transcend to the data science domain. Individual contributors
    and managers alike who are already established within the pharmaceutical, life
    sciences, and biotechnology sectors will find this book not only useful, but immensely
    applicable to current-day projects. Although an introduction to Python and machine
    learning is provided, a basic understanding of Python programming and a beginner-level
    background in data science conjunction is recommended to get the most out of this
    book.
