    of this book, we’ve covered a lot of topics on quantum computing, both from a
    theoretical and a practical point of view, so maybe it’s time to take a look back
    and see what we have learned.

    concepts underlying the theory of quantum computing, including how information
    is stored on qubits, how we can transform their states with quantum gates, and
    how we can obtain results by measuring them. Then, we explored some of the software
    tools currently available to implement quantum algorithms, with a special emphasis
    on the two main software libraries used in this book: Qiskit and PennyLane. We
    learned how to implement quantum circuits with both frameworks and how to run
    them on simulators and on actual quantum hardware.'

    problems. To that end, we studied different ways of formulating combinatorial
    optimization problems as the search for ground states of certain Hamiltonians.
    This is how we got to know the QUBO and Ising formalisms, that we later used with
    different types of quantum computers. First, we used quantum annealers, with their
    heuristic implementation of adiabatic quantum computing, and we learned different
    ways of solving optimization problems with them. Then, we turned to gate-based
    quantum computers, and studied the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
    and Grover’s Adaptive Search.

    in which our interest was set on finding ground states of observables related
    to problems in different fields, including chemistry and physics. In this case,
    our focus was on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. At the same time that we
    studied its mathematical definition and its practical implementation, we also
    learned about noisy simulations and readout error mitigation.

    in machine learning. We first briefly reviewed *classical* machine learning and
    explained what makes quantum machine learning different. Then, we started studying
    several quantum machine learning model architectures. The first was that of Quantum
    Support Vector Machines, which we derived from classical SVMs by introducing quantum
    kernels.

    neural networks that are called — not very imaginatively, we concede — quantum
    neural networks. For this, we used parametrized circuits in two different ways:'

    and we mixed them with classical neural networks to form hybrid neural networks.
    We also learned a thing or two about hyperparameter optimization with Optuna and
    about building and training classical and hybrid networks with PyTorch. All this
    hard work paid off soon, because it allowed us to implement a very interesting
    model architecture: that of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. We learned
    a little bit about the theory behind them and we showed how to implement and train
    a couple of simple examples to learn quantum states and probability distributions.'

    algorithms: they have been proposed in the last 10 years or so, mainly with current,
    noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers in mind. And they are the subject of
    intense development and study by the quantum computing community as we are writing
    these lines. You may very well say that, with this book, you now know a good deal
    about what the *present* of quantum computing looks like.'

    behind the methods and devices that we have studied may be (and they truly are!),
    they still have some limitations (that sometimes are painfully obvious). Due to
    the reduced scale and resilience to the noise of current quantum computers and
    due to our incomplete understanding of the capabilities of modern quantum algorithms
    such as QAOA, VQE, or the different flavors of quantum neural networks, it is
    difficult to demonstrate quantum computational advantage. In fact, in the cases
    in which this has been achieved (the most famous one being the quantum supremacy
    experiment developed by Google researchers [[9](ch030.xhtml#Xarute2019quantum)]),
    the problems are mainly academic and of little practical application.

    On the contrary! There is still much work to do, but we think that we are experiencing
    the beginning of what could very well be a revolution in the way we compute and
    process information. The famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke formulated
    three adages that are popularly known as **Clarke’s** **laws**. They go as follows:'

    — and, probably, the third is the one that most often has been quoted when talking
    about quantum computers! But we are especially interested in the second one. We
    need to keep on investigating, further pushing the frontiers of our knowledge,
    and exploring new techniques for processing information with quantum devices.
    To that end, in the next few years, we expect to see developments on different
    fronts.

    computers. In fact, while we were writing this book, IBM announced Osprey, a quantum
    processor with 433 qubits [[55](ch030.xhtml#Xibm2022osprey)]. But that is not
    all. They plan to introduce quantum computers with thousands of qubits in the
    next few years and other big companies such as Google and Honeywell have similar
    roadmaps. Size is not the only thing that matters, though, and a lot of effort
    is being put into decreasing gate and readout errors and in increasing coherence
    times. This will be crucial to reach the ultimate goal of having fault-tolerant,
    scalable quantum computers.

    of quantum advantage: practical experiments in which a quantum computer solves
    a task much faster than what is possible with the most powerful classical supercomputer
    available. Probably, the concrete problems tackled in these demonstrations will
    be not very useful from a practical point of view. However, we think that pursuing
    these advantages is still very relevant. The more diverse the range of techniques
    used to achieve quantum supremacy, the better for the field of quantum computing.'

    that we are most excited to see are those related to the development of new quantum
    methods, the increase of the applicability of quantum techniques, and the deepening
    of our understanding of the properties of quantum algorithms. In fact, as we have
    tried to convey throughout this book, this is a field of intense study. To name
    just a couple of recent highlights, in the last few months, we have witnessed
    a new quantum exponential speedup [[99](ch030.xhtml#Xyamakawa2022verifiable)]
    and the proof that quantum neural networks may need much less data than their
    classical counterparts in certain situations [[112](ch030.xhtml#Xqnn-lowdata)].

    techniques, or mathematically proving quantum advantage are, by no means, easy
    tasks. But we are confident that, as more and more people learn about quantum
    computing and as more and more quantum computers become available to run experiments,
    our knowledge and understanding of the power of quantum algorithms will only grow
    bigger. And with that, new, exciting, and powerful applications will eventually
    become a reality.
