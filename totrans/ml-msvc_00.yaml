    our daily lives in ways that were previously thought impossible. By combining
    ML algorithms with **Microservices Architecture** (**MSA**), organizations are
    able to create intelligent, robust, flexible, and scalable enterprise systems
    that can adapt to changing business requirements and improve overall system performance.'
