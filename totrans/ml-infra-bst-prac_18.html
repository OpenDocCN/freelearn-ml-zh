			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Ethics in Data Acquisition  and Management</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) requires<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> a lot of data that can come from a variety of sources, but not all sources are equally easy to use. In software engineering, we can design and develop systems that use data from other systems. We can also use data that does not really originate from people; for example, we can use data about defects or complexity of systems. However, to provide more value to society, we need to use data that contains information about people or their belongings; for example, when we train machines to recognize faces or license plates. Regardless of our use case, however, we need to follow ethical guidelines and, above all, have the guiding principle that our software should not cause <span class="No-Break">any harm.</span></p>
			<p>We start this chapter by exploring a few examples of unethical systems that show bias; for example, credit ranking systems that penalize certain minorities. I will also explain problems with using open source data and revealing the identities of subjects. The core of the chapter, however, is an explanation and discussion on ethical frameworks for data management and software systems, including the <strong class="bold">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (<strong class="bold">IEEE</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">Association for Computing Machinery</strong> (<strong class="bold">ACM</strong>) codes <span class="No-Break">of conduct.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ethics in computer science and <span class="No-Break">software engineering</span></li>
				<li>Data is all around us, but can we really <span class="No-Break">use it?</span></li>
				<li>Ethics behind data from open <span class="No-Break">source systems</span></li>
				<li>Ethics behind data collected <span class="No-Break">from humans</span></li>
				<li>Contracts and <span class="No-Break">legal obligations</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Ethics in computer science and software engineering</h1>
			<p>The modern <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>view on ethics has its roots in the Nuremberg Code, which was developed after the Second World War. The code is based on several principles, but<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> the most important one is the fact that every study needs to have permission if it involves human subjects. This is essential, as it prevents the abuse of humans during experimentation. Every participant in a study should also be able to retract their permission at any given time. Let us look at all <span class="No-Break">10 principles:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The voluntary consent of the human subject is <span class="No-Break">absolutely essential.</span></li>
				<li>The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary <span class="No-Break">in nature.</span></li>
				<li>The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of <span class="No-Break">the experiment.</span></li>
				<li>The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering <span class="No-Break">and injury.</span></li>
				<li>No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve <span class="No-Break">as subjects.</span></li>
				<li>The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by <span class="No-Break">the experiment.</span></li>
				<li>Proper preparations should be made, and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, <span class="No-Break">or death.</span></li>
				<li>The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in <span class="No-Break">the experiment.</span></li>
				<li>During <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>the course of the experiment, the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if they have reached a physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to them to <span class="No-Break">be impossible.</span></li>
				<li>During the <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>course of the experiment, the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage if they have probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill, and careful judgment required of them, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death of the <span class="No-Break">experimental subject.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The Nuremberg Code laid the foundation for modern ethical standards in human experimentation and research. It has been influential in the development of subsequent ethical guidelines and regulations, such<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> as the <strong class="bold">Declaration of Helsinki</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoH</strong>) and various national and international regulations governing human research ethics. These principles emphasize the importance of respecting the rights and well-being of research participants and ensuring that research is conducted in an ethical and <span class="No-Break">responsible manner.</span></p>
			<p>The aforementioned principles are designed to guide experiments toward bringing value to society, but at the same time to respect the participants of the experiments. The first principle is about consent, which is important as we want to prevent using subjects who are not aware of the experiments. In the context of ML, this means that we need to be very careful when we collect data that includes humans; for example, when we collect image data to train object recognition, or when we collect data from open source repositories that contain <span class="No-Break">personal information.</span></p>
			<p>Although we do conduct experiments in software engineering, these principles are more universal than we might think. In this chapter, we explore how these principles affect the ethics of data in the engineering of <span class="No-Break">AI systems.</span></p>
			<p>In addition to these principles, we also look at the sources of bias in data and how to <span class="No-Break">avoid it.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Data is all around us, but can we really use it?</h1>
			<p>One of the ways in which we protect subjects and data is to use appropriate licenses for the use of data. Licenses are a sort of contract in that the licensor grants permission to use the data in a specific way to a licensee. Licenses are used for both software products (algorithms, components) and data. The following license models are the most commonly used ones in <span class="No-Break">contemporary software:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proprietary license</strong>: It is a <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>model whereby the licensor owns the data and grants permission to use the data for certain purposes, often for profit. In such a contract, the parties usually regulate what the data can be used for, how, and for how long. These licenses also regulate liabilities for <span class="No-Break">both parties.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Permissive open licenses</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker556"/> are licenses that provide the licensee almost unrestricted access to the data, at the same time limiting the liability of the licensor. The licensee is often not required to provide access to the licensee’s product or <span class="No-Break">derivative work.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Non-permissive open licenses</strong>: These are licenses that provide almost unrestricted access, at the<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> same time requiring some sort of reciprocity. Usually, the reciprocity is in the form of requiring the licensee to provide access to the product or the <span class="No-Break">derivative work.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Naturally, these three classes of licenses also have variants. So, let’s take a look at one of the popular open source licenses – the Unsplash license from <span class="No-Break">Hugging Face:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Unsplash
All unsplash.com images have the Unsplash license copied below:
<a href="https://unsplash.com/license">https://unsplash.com/license</a>
License
Unsplash photos are made to be used freely. Our license reflects that.
All photos can be downloaded and used for free
Commercial and non-commercial purposes
No permission needed (though attribution is appreciated!)
What is not permitted
Photos cannot be sold without significant modification.
Compiling photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.
Tip: How to give attribution
Even though attribution isn't required, Unsplash photographers appreciate it as it provides exposure to their work and encourages them to continue sharing.
Photo by &lt;person name&gt; on Unsplash
Longform
Unsplash grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash. This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.
Other Images
All other images were either taken by the authors, or created by friends of the authors and all permissions to modify, distribute, copy, perform and use are given to the authors.</pre>			<p>The license comes from this dataset: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/dreambooth/blob/main/dataset/references_and_licenses.txt">https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/dreambooth/blob/main/dataset/references_and_licenses.txt</a>. Let us take a closer look at what the license means. First of all, here’s what the <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>Unsplash <span class="No-Break">license allows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Free use</strong>: We can download and use the images from Unsplash without <span class="No-Break">any cost.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Commercial and non-commercial use</strong>: We can use the images for both business-related purposes (such as in advertisements, websites, and product packaging) as well as personal projects or <span class="No-Break">non-profit activities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">No need for permission</strong>: We don’t have to ask for consent or permission from the photographer or Unsplash to use the image. This makes the process hassle-free <span class="No-Break">and convenient.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Modification and redistribution</strong>: We can modify the original image in any way you see fit and distribute it. However, if you wish to sell the image, it should be significantly modified from <span class="No-Break">the original.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license</strong>: Once you download the photo, you have the right to use it indefinitely (irrevocable). Nonexclusive means others can also use the same image, and worldwide implies there are no geographical restrictions on <span class="No-Break">its use.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the same time, the license prohibits <span class="No-Break">certain activities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Selling unaltered photos</strong>: We cannot sell the photos in their original form or without making significant modifications <span class="No-Break">to them.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Replicating Unsplash’s service</strong>: We can’t use the images to create a service that directly competes with or is similar to Unsplash. In other words, downloading a bunch of Unsplash images and then starting your own stock photo service using those images would be a violation of <span class="No-Break">the license.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The license also regulates the form of attribution – while it’s not mandatory to give credit to the photographer or Unsplash when you use an image, it is encouraged. Attribution is a way of recognizing the effort of the photographer. The provided example, “<em class="italic">Photo by &lt;person name&gt; on Unsplash</em>” is a suggested format for <span class="No-Break">giving credit.</span></p>
			<p>It also regulates what happens if there are other images in that dataset (for example, added by a third party): for images that are not from Unsplash, the authors either took these pictures themselves or had them created by acquaintances. They have full permission to use, distribute, modify, and perform these images without <span class="No-Break">any restrictions.</span></p>
			<p>We can also <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>take a look at one of the permissive licenses from <strong class="bold">Creative Commons</strong> (<strong class="bold">CC</strong>); for example, the <strong class="bold">Creative Commons, By Attribution, version 4.0</strong> (<strong class="bold">CC-BY-4.0</strong>) license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode</a>). In short, this license allows the sharing and redistributing of data, under the <span class="No-Break">following conditions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Attribution</strong>, which means that we must give the appropriate credit to the author of the data when we use it, and we must provide a link to the reference and indicate changes that we make to <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">No additional restrictions</strong>, which means that we cannot impose any additional restrictions on the use of the data that we license in this way. We must not use any means to restrict others from using this data if it is used in <span class="No-Break">our product.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The entire text of the license is a bit too large to quote, but let us analyze parts of it so that we can see the difference from the very permissive Unsplash license. First of all, the license provides a number of definitions, which can help in legal disputes. For instance, <em class="italic">Section 1.i</em> defines what it means <span class="No-Break">to share:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.</pre>			<p>The preceding legal text may sound complex, but when we read it, the text specifies what it means to share data. For example, it says that “<em class="italic">importation</em>” is one of the means of sharing data. This means that providing data as part of a Python package, C# library, or GitHub repository is a means of <span class="No-Break">sharing data.</span></p>
			<p>We can also take a look at <em class="italic">Section 2</em> of the license, where the definitions from <em class="italic">Section 1</em> are used. Here is an example of <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Section 2.a.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
* reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
* produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</pre>			<p>In the first part, we learn that the license allows us to use the material royalty-free; that is, we do not have to pay for it. It also specifies the geographical location for the use (worldwide) and says that we are not the only ones using this data (non-exclusive). Then, the license also says that we can reproduce the material, both in whole and in parts, or produce <span class="No-Break">adapted material.</span></p>
			<p>However, certain rights are not transferred to us, as licensees, which we learn in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Section 2.b.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</pre>			<p>This section explains that moral rights to the data are not transferred. In particular, if we encounter data that is private or can be linked to persons, we are not granted the right to it. Three parts are <span class="No-Break">important here:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Moral rights</strong>: Moral rights<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> are a subset of copyright that pertains to the personal and reputational, rather than the purely economic, aspects of a work. These rights might vary from one jurisdiction to another, but often they include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Right of integrity</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>is the right of an author to object to any distortion, mutilation, or other modification of a work if it would be prejudicial to their honor <span class="No-Break">or reputation</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Right of attribution</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>the right of an author to be credited as the creator of <span class="No-Break">their work</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">The CC license specifies that these moral rights are not licensed. This means that while someone might be able to use the work in ways defined by the CC license, they don’t have carte blanche to modify the work in ways that could damage the original creator’s reputation <span class="No-Break">or honor.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Publicity, privacy, and other similar personality rights</strong>: These rights pertain <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>to an<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> individual’s personal data, likeness, name, or voice. They’re rights that protect<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> against unwanted exposure or exploitation. The CC license doesn’t grant users the right to infringe on <span class="No-Break">these either.</span><p class="list-inset">For example, if a photograph of a person is under a CC license, while we might be able to use the photo itself in ways allowed by that license, it doesn’t mean we can use the person’s likeness in a commercial or promotional manner without <span class="No-Break">their consent.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Waiving or not asserting rights</strong>: The licensor is, however, waiving or agreeing<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> not to enforce these moral or personal rights to the extent necessary for us to exercise the licensed rights. This means the licensor won’t interfere with our use of the work as permitted by the CC license by invoking their moral or personal rights, but only up to a point. They’re not giving up these rights entirely; they’re only limiting their enforcement in contexts relevant to the <span class="No-Break">CC license.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I strongly encourage readers to read the license and reflect on how it is constructed, including the parts that regulate the liability of <span class="No-Break">the licensor.</span></p>
			<p>We move on, however, to licenses that are not as permissive as the CC-BY-4.0 license. For example, let us take a look at one of the so-called copyleft licenses: <strong class="bold">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International</strong> (<strong class="bold">CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</strong>). This license allows us to copy and redistribute data in any format, under the following conditions (quoted and adapted from the following CC web <span class="No-Break">page: </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/):"><span class="No-Break">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/</span><span class="No-Break">):</span></a></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Attribution</strong>: We must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. We may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses us or <span class="No-Break">our use.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">NonCommercial</strong>: We may not use the material for <span class="No-Break">commercial purposes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">NoDerivatives</strong>: If we remix, transform, or build upon the material, we may not distribute the <span class="No-Break">modified material.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">No additional restrictions</strong>: We may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the <span class="No-Break">license permits.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The body of the license text is structured similarly to the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license, which we quoted before. Let us look at the part where the license differs – <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Section 2.a.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
* reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
* produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.</pre>			<p>The first bullet point means that we can share licensed material for non-commercial purposes only. The second bullet extends that to the adapted material <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>One question that can be raised directly is, then, this: <em class="italic">How to select a license for the data that we create?</em> That’s where my next best practice comes <span class="No-Break">into play.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice #70</p>
			<p class="callout">If you create your own data for non-commercial purposes, use one of the permissive derivative licenses that limit <span class="No-Break">your liability.</span></p>
			<p>When designing commercial licenses, please always consult your legal counsel so that you select the best license model for your data and your product. However, if you work on open source data, try to use a license that regulates two aspects – whether it is possible to use your data for commercial purposes and what your <span class="No-Break">liability is.</span></p>
			<p>In my work, I try to be as open as possible, simply because of my belief in open science, but this does not need to be universally true. Therefore, I often guard myself from commercial use of my data – hence the <span class="No-Break">non-commercial purposes.</span></p>
			<p>The second aspect is liability. When we collect our data, we cannot think about all possible uses of data, which means that there is always a risk of the data being misused, or a risk of making a mistake when using our data. We do not want to be sued for something that we did not do, so it is always a good idea to limit our liability in such a license. We can limit it in a few ways; one of them is stating that the licensee is responsible for ensuring that the data is used in an ethical way or according to all rules and regulations applicable in the <span class="No-Break">appropriate region.</span></p>
			<p>This brings us to the next point – the ethical use of data from open <span class="No-Break">source systems.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Ethics behind data from open source systems</h1>
			<p>Proprietary <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>systems oftentimes have licenses that regulate who owns the data and for what purpose. For example, code review data from a company often belongs to the company. By working for the company, the employees usually sign off their rights to the data that they generate for the company. It is needed in the legal sense because the employees are getting compensated for that – usually in the form <span class="No-Break">of salaries.</span></p>
			<p>However, what the employees do not transfer to the company is the right to use their personal data freely. This means that when we work with source systems, such as the Gerrit review system, we should not extract personal information without the permission of the people involved. If we execute the query where masking of this data is not possible, we must ensure that the personal data is anonymized (as soon as it is possible) and is not leaked to the analysis. We must ensure that such personal data is not made <span class="No-Break">publicly available.</span></p>
			<p>One of the areas where we can find guidance is the field of mining software repositories; for example, in a recent article by Gold and Krinke. Despite a low sample size in this study, the authors touch upon important issues related to the ethical use of data from software repositories such as GitHub or Gerrit. They bring up several data sources, with the most <span class="No-Break">popular being:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Version control data, such as CVS, Subversion, Git, or Mercurial</strong>: There are challenges related to licensing and the presence of personal information in <span class="No-Break">the repositories.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue tracker data, such as Bugzilla</strong>: Challenges are mostly related to the presence of personal data in such repositories or the ability to connect data to <span class="No-Break">persons implicitly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mail archives</strong>: Mailing lists are flexible and can be used for different purposes; for example, issue tracking, code review, Q&amp;A forums, and so on. However, they can contain sensitive personal information or can lead to conclusions that can <span class="No-Break">impact individuals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build logs</strong>: <strong class="bold">Version control systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) often use some kind of <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) system to automate building the software. If the build results are<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> archived, they can provide data for research into testing and <span class="No-Break">building practices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stack Overflow</strong>: Stack Overflow provides official dumps of their data, and (subsets of) the dumps have been used as challenges directly, or inside a dataset aggregating historic information. Despite licensing regulations that require users to allow the use of their data for analyses, not all <span class="No-Break">are ethical.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IDE events</strong>: The main challenges are related to the fact that each IDE is set up for individuals and has access to very personal data and the behavior of <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Given the amount of source code that is available online in repositories such as GitHub, it is tempting to analyze it for all kinds of purposes. We could mine the repositories for source code in order to understand how software is constructed, designed, and tested. Such use of source code is then limited by the licenses provided for <span class="No-Break">each repository.</span></p>
			<p>At the same time, when mining data about source code, we can mine data about contributors, their comments for pull requests, and the organizations where they work. This use of repositories is then governed by the licenses and by the ethical guidelines for using personal data. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, using personal data requires consent from the individuals, which means that we should ask the persons whose data we analyze for permission. In practice, however, this is impossible, for two reasons – one is the<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> practical ability to contact all contributors, and the second is the terms of use of the repository. Most repositories prohibit contacting contributors to <span class="No-Break">study them.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, we need to apply the principle related to balance between privacy and the benefit. In most cases, the privacy of individuals is worth more than the value of the study that we conduct, hence my next <span class="No-Break">best practice.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice #71</p>
			<p class="callout">Limit yourself to studying source code and other artifacts, and use personal data only with the consent of <span class="No-Break">the subjects.</span></p>
			<p>There are numerous ethical codes, but most of them come to the same conclusion – consent is required when using personal data. Therefore, we should use open source data with caution and analyze only the data that is necessary for our studies. Always obtain informed consent when analyzing data from people. As the article suggests, we can follow the next guidelines for <span class="No-Break">studying repositories.</span></p>
			<p>There are a number of guidelines for studying open <span class="No-Break">source repositories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>When studying source code, we need to be mostly concerned about the license and ensure that we do not mix source code with the personal data of <span class="No-Break">the people.</span></li>
				<li>When studying commits, we need to respect the identities of people who make contributions, as they are probably not aware of being studied. We must make sure that no harm or damage is caused to these individuals based on our research. If we need to study personal data, then we need to apply for approval from the institutional ethics board and obtain explicit consent. In the case of some licenses, the license is extended to messages in commits – for example, Apache License 2.0: “<em class="italic">any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">tracking systems</em></span><span class="No-Break">”.</span></li>
				<li>When mining IDE events, we should obtain consent as the individuals are probably not aware of being studied. As opposed to the studies of data from open repositories, IDE events can contain more personal data, as these tools are integrated with the software ecosystem of <span class="No-Break">the users.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When mining build logs</strong>: The same principles apply here as they do for commits, as these can be <span class="No-Break">easily linked.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When mining Stack Overflow</strong>: Although the Stack Overflow license allows us to <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>conduct certain research since the users need to allow this (according to the terms of use), we need to make sure that there is a balance between the benefits of the study and the risks related to analyzing the data, which is often a free text plus some <span class="No-Break">source code.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When mining issue trackers</strong>: Some issue trackers, such as Debian, provide the possibility to analyze the data, but it needs to be synchronized with the <span class="No-Break">ethics board.</span></li>
				<li>When mining mailing lists, we need to try to obtain permission from the ethical board since these lists often contain personal information and should be scrutinized before it <span class="No-Break">is used.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><em class="italic">The Menlo Report</em> by Kenneally and Dittrich from 2012 provides a number of guidelines for ethical research in information and communication technology, including software engineering. They define four principles (quoted after <span class="No-Break">the report):</span></p>

			<p>The report<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> encourages researchers and engineers to make a stakeholder identification and an identification of their perspectives and considerations. One of these considerations is the presence of malicious actors who can abuse the results of our work and/or harm the individuals whose data we analyze. We must always protect the people whose data we analyze and ensure that we do not cause them any harm. The same applies to the organizations we <span class="No-Break">work with.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Ethics behind data collected from humans</h1>
			<p>In Europe, one of<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> the main legal frameworks that regulates how we can use the data is the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679</a>). It regulates the scope of handling personal data and puts requirements on the organization to obtain permission to collect, process, and use personal data, as well as requiring organizations to provide individuals with the ability to revoke permissions. The regulation is the most restrictive international regulation that is meant to protect individuals (us) from being abused by companies that have the means and abilities to collect and process data <span class="No-Break">about us.</span></p>
			<p>Although we use a lot of data from GitHub and similar repositories, there are repositories where we also store the data. One of them is Zenodo, which is used increasingly often to store datasets. Its terms of use require us to obtain the right permissions. Here are its terms of <span class="No-Break">use (</span><a href="https://about.zenodo.org/terms/):"><span class="No-Break">https://about.zenodo.org/terms/</span><span class="No-Break">):</span></a></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
1. Zenodo is an open dissemination research data repository for the preservation and making available of research, educational and informational content. Access to Zenodo's content is open to all, for non-military purposes only.
2. Content may be uploaded free of charge by those without ready access to an organised data centre.
3. The uploader is exclusively responsible for the content that they upload to Zenodo and shall indemnify and hold CERN free and harmless in connection with their use of the service. The uploader shall ensure that their content is suitable for open dissemination, and that it complies with these terms and applicable laws, including, but not limited to, privacy, data protection and intellectual property rights *. In addition, where data that was originally sensitive personal data is being uploaded for open dissemination through Zenodo, the uploader shall ensure that such data is either anonymised to an appropriate degree or fully consent cleared **.
4. Access to Zenodo, and all content, is provided on an "as-is" basis. Users of content ("Users") shall respect applicable license conditions. Download and use of content from Zenodo does not transfer any intellectual property rights in the content to the User.
5. Users are exclusively responsible for their use of content, and shall indemnify and hold CERN free and harmless in connection with their download and/or use. Hosting and making content available through Zenodo does not represent any approval or endorsement of such content by CERN.
6. CERN reserves the right, without notice, at its sole discretion and without liability, (i) to alter, delete or block access to content that it deems to be inappropriate or insufficiently protected, and (ii) to restrict or remove User access where it considers that use of Zenodo interferes with its operations or violates these Terms of Use or applicable laws.
7. Unless specified otherwise, Zenodo metadata may be freely reused under the CC0 waiver.
8. These Terms of Use are subject to change by CERN at any time and without notice, other than through posting the updated Terms of Use on the Zenodo website.
* Uploaders considering Zenodo for the storage of unanonymised or encrypted/unencrypted sensitive personal data are advised to use bespoke platforms rather than open dissemination services like Zenodo for sharing their data
** See further the user pages regarding uploading for information on anonymisation of datasets that contain sensitive personal information.</pre>			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> important part is about the responsibility <span class="No-Break">for content:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you upload content, you’re solely responsible <span class="No-Break">for it.</span></li>
				<li>We must ensure that our content is appropriate for public viewing and follows all relevant laws and these terms. This <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>includes laws and terms related to privacy, data protection, and <strong class="bold">intellectual property</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">IP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) rights.</span></li>
				<li>If we’re uploading sensitive personal data, we must make sure it’s either appropriately anonymized or we have full consent to <span class="No-Break">share it.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I cannot stress that enough – the information that we provide at Zenodo is our responsibility, so we should make sure that we do not do any harm by providing it open to everyone. If there is non-anonymized data, we should consider other types of storage; for example, storage that requires authentication or access control, hence my next <span class="No-Break">best practice.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice #72</p>
			<p class="callout">Any personal data should be stored behind authentication and access control to prevent malicious actors from <span class="No-Break">accessing it.</span></p>
			<p>Although we may have permission to use personal, non-anonymized data, we should keep this kind of data behind authentication. We need to protect the individuals who are behind this data. We also need to use access control and monitoring in case we need to backtrack who accessed the data; for instance, when a mistake <span class="No-Break">was made.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Contracts and legal obligations</h1>
			<p>To finish the<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> chapter, I would like to take up one last topic. Although there is a lot of data available, we must make sure that we do our due diligence and find out which contracts and obligations apply <span class="No-Break">to us.</span></p>
			<p>Licenses are one type of contract, but not the only one. Almost all universities put contracts and obligations on researchers. These may include the need to ask for permission from ethical review boards or the need to make data available for scrutiny from <span class="No-Break">other researchers.</span></p>
			<p>Professional codes<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> of conduct are another type of obligation; for example, the one from ACM (<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics</a>). These codes of conduct often stem from the Nuremberg Code and require us to ensure that our work is for the good <span class="No-Break">of society.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, when working with commercial organizations, we may need to sign a so-called <strong class="bold">non-disclosure agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">NDA</strong>). Such <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>agreements are often required to ensure that we do not disclose information without prior permission. They are often mistaken for the need to conceal information, but in most cases, it means that we need to ensure that our reporting of proprietary information does not harm the organization. In most cases, we may need to ensure that our report is about general practices rather than a specific company. If we see deficiencies with our industrial partners, we need to discuss them with our industrial partners and help them to improve – because we need to work for the best <span class="No-Break">of society.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, I strongly encourage you to find out which codes of conduct, obligations, and contracts are applicable <span class="No-Break">to you.</span></p>
