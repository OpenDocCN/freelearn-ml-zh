<p>Statistics is a discipline of study used for applying analytical methods to answer questions and solve problems using data, in both academic and industry settings. Many methods have been around for centuries, while others are much more recent. Statistical analysis and results are fairly straightforward for presenting to both technical and non-technical audiences. Furthermore, producing results with statistical analysis does not necessarily require large amounts of data or compute resources and can be done fairly quickly, especially when using programming languages such as Python, which is moderately easy to work with <span class="No-Break">and implement.</span></p>
<p>While artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced machine learning (ML) tools have become more prominent and popular over recent years with the increase of accessibility in compute power, performing statistical analysis as a precursor to developing larger-scale projects using AI and ML can enable a practitioner to assess feasibility and practicality before using larger compute resources and project architecture development for those types <span class="No-Break">of projects.</span></p>
<p>This book provides a wide variety of tools that are commonly used to test hypotheses and provide basic predictive capabilities to analysts and data scientists alike. The reader will walk through the basic concepts and terminology required for understanding the statistical tools in this book prior to exploring the different tests and conditions under which they are applicable. Further, the reader will gain knowledge for assessing the performance of the tests. Throughout, examples will be provided in the Python programming language to get readers started understanding their data using the tools presented, which will be applicable to some of the most common questions faced in the data analytics industry. The topics we will walk <span class="No-Break">through include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to statistics</li>
<li>Regression models</li>
<li>Classification models</li>
<li>Time series models</li>
<li>Survival analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the tools provided in these sections will provide the reader with a firm foundation from which further independent growth in the statistics domain can more easily <span class="No-Break">be achieved.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>Professionals in most industries can benefit from the tools in this book. The tools provided are useful primarily at a higher level of inferential analysis, but can be applied to deeper levels depending on the industry in which the practitioner wishes to apply them. The target audiences of this <span class="No-Break">book are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Industry professionals with limited statistical or programming knowledge who would like to learn to use data for testing hypotheses they have in their business domain</li>
<li>Data analysts and scientists who wish to broaden their statistical knowledge and find a set of tools and their implementations for performing various data-oriented tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>The ground-up approach of this book seeks to provide entry into the knowledge base for a wide audience and therefore should neither discourage novice-level practitioners nor exclude advanced-level practitioners from the benefits of the <span class="No-Break">materials presented.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B18945_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Sampling and Generalization</em>, describes the concepts of sampling and generalization. The discussion of sampling covers several common methods for sampling data from a population and discusses the implications for generalization.
