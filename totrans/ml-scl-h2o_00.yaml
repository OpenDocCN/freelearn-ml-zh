- en: 'At this point in time, **machine learning** (**ML**) requires little introduction:
    it is both pervasive and transformative to businesses, non-profits, and scientific
    organizations. ML is built on data. We are all aware of the exponential growth
    of data collected each year, and the growing diversity of sources that generate
    this data. This book is about leveraging these massive data volumes to do ML.
    We call this *machine learning at scale* and define it on three pillars: building
    high-quality models on large to massive datasets, deploying them for scoring in
    diverse enterprise environments, and navigating multiple stakeholder concerns
    along the way. Here, scale considers both data volume and enterprise context,
    model building, and model deployment. In this book, we will show you, in practical
    terms, how H2O overcomes the many challenges of performing ML at scale.'

- en: The book starts with a general overview of the challenges of performing ML at
    scale, and how the H2O framework overcomes these challenges while producing high-quality
    models and enterprise-grade deployments. From there, it transitions to advanced
    treatment of model-building techniques and model deployment patterns using H2O
    at Scale. We then look at its technological underpinnings from the perspective
    of multiple enterprise stakeholders who need to understand, deploy, and maintain
    this system, and show how this relates to data scientist activities and needs.
    We finish by showing how H2O at Scale can be implemented on its own or as part
    of the larger and richly featured H2O AI Cloud platform, where it takes on exciting
    new levels of ML possibilities and business value.

    explainable ML models from massive datasets, deploy these models to a great diversity
    of enterprise systems, and assemble state-of-the-art ML solutions that achieve
    unique forms of business value.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for data scientists, ML engineers, system administrators,
    enterprise architects, and curious technologists who want to build and deploy
    ML models at scale using H2O. Those already familiar with H2O will learn advanced
    model-building techniques and deployment patterns, as well as the details of how
    H2O works under the hood. Students with knowledge of ML but little or no work
    experience will gain an understanding of how it is performed in the world of large
    enterprises. Basic knowledge of ML is recommended, and an understanding of Python
    is needed to follow code examples.

    and Challenges*, sets the context of the book. We will first define ML at scale
    around three areas: building high-quality models on large to massive datasets,
    deploying them for scoring in diverse enterprise environments, and navigating
    multiple stakeholder concerns along the way. We will then recognize the vast business
    opportunities and execution challenges of ML in this context. In this light, you
    will be introduced to how H2O overcomes these challenges with its **H2O-3**, **Sparkling
    Water**, **Enterprise Steam**, and **MOJO** technologies that form the H2O at
    Scale framework.'

    the ML life cycle, what its key features are, and how it overcomes the challenges
    of ML at scale. We then distill several key concepts from this overview. The goal
    of this chapter is to provide you with a foundational knowledge of how H2O at

    Building a model that predicts well is not enough. A critical step before putting
    any model into production is understanding how it makes decisions. We discuss
    selecting appropriate model metrics, using multiple diagnostics to build trust
    in a model, and using global and local explanations with model performance metrics
    to choose the best among a set of candidate models. This includes an evaluation
    of tradeoffs between model performance, speed of scoring, and assumptions met
    in a candidate model.'

    be one that is relevant to the business and can be answered by the available data.
    We engineer a variety of features, creating and evaluating multiple candidate
    models until we arrive at a final model. We evaluate the final model and illustrate
