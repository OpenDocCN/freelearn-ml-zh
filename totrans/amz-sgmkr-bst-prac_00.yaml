- en: '**Amazon SageMaker** is a fully managed AWS service that provides the ability
    to build, train, deploy, and monitor machine learning models. The book begins
    with a high-level overview of Amazon SageMaker capabilities that map to the various
    phases of the machine learning process to help set the right foundation. You''ll
    learn efficient tactics to address data science challenges such as processing
    data at scale, data preparation, connecting to big data pipelines, identifying
    data bias, running A/B tests, and model explainability using Amazon SageMaker.'

- en: As you advance, you'll understand how you can tackle the challenge of training
    at scale, including how to use large datasets while saving costs, monitoring training
    resources to identify bottlenecks, speeding up long training jobs, and tracking
    multiple models trained for a common goal. Moving ahead, you'll find out how you
    can integrate Amazon SageMaker with other AWS services to build reliable, cost-optimized,
    and automated machine learning applications. In addition to this, you'll build
    ML pipelines integrated with MLOps principles and apply best practices to build
    secure and performant solutions.
