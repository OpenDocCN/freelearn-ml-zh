<p>In this chapter, we will provide a brief introduction to the IBM Cloud platform and the services that it offers, such as <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>). Moreover, this chapter will provide detailed instructions on how to set up a data science and machine learning development environment on the IBM Cloud. Finally, we will conclude with a project example that involves loading and visualizing data. </p>
<p>We'll break down this first chapter into the following sections: </p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding IBM Cloud</li>
<li>The IBM Cloud and Watson Machine Learning services</li>
<li>Setting up the environment</li>
<li>Data visualization tutorial </li>

<p>What can we say about the IBM Cloud environment? What makes it unique and so exciting? To start, the IBM Cloud platform (formerly known as <strong>Bluemix</strong>) actually combines <strong>platform as a service</strong> (<strong>PaaS</strong>) with <strong>infrastructure as a service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>) and, in addition, offers a collection or catalog of cloud services that you can integrate with PaaS and IaaS to efficiently build individual, enterprise, or even global innovative applications. </p>
<p>Some other key points on the IBM Cloud (from a developer perspective) include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can develop in what is called a <strong>cloud without borders</strong>, which means that you can connect private services to the public IBM Cloud services that are available from IBM</li>
<li>You can expect to see a continuously growing number of services and runtime frameworks being added and becoming available to you</li>
<li>You can take an idea from start, to development sandbox, to a globally distributed environment with the IBM Watson tools and services without having to make major investments</li>
<li>You can test and adopt an extensive range of cloud services and capabilities from IBM, open source communities, and third-party developers</li>
<li>You can control resources in real time as per the needs or workload demands change</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There's much more we can do.</span></p>

<p>Being a cloud-based environment, the IBM Cloud has no prerequisites to worry about, which makes getting it up and running pretty easy. All you really need is a web browser (see the documentation for the recommended versions) and a reasonable internet connection. </p>
<p>Optional, but recommended, is the <strong>IBM Cloud Developer Toolset</strong>. IBM touts this as a unified way to interact with your applications, containers, infrastructures, and other services. In this installation, you get the standalone IBM Cloud <strong>command-line interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>), plus various tools such as Git, Docker, Helm, kubectl, and curl, as well as the following IBM Cloud plugins: </p>
<ul>
<li>IBM Cloud Developer Tools plugin </li>
<li>IBM Cloud Functions plugin </li>
<li>IBM Cloud Container Registry plugin </li>
<li>IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plugin </li>
<li>The sdk-gen plugin </li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you want to install both the IBM Cloud CLI and the other recommended plugins and tools for developing applications for IBM Cloud, follow the method described online here: <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview</a>.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>Let's get started! To access the IBM Cloud, you can go to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud" target="_blank">https://www.ibm.com/cloud</a> where you will arrive at the <span class="packt_screen">Cloud sign-up/log-in</span> page, which is shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4a5ccf2d-06a7-4ab3-a3e8-2dac7201fd69.png" style=""/></div>
<p>If you click on the blue <span class="packt_screen">Cloud sign-up/log-in</span> link, you can create a free account (using your IBM ID) or log in (once you have set up your paid or free account).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>After your ID has been authenticated, you will arrive at the IBM Cloud main page or the console, which is shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b1a1ced8-b001-4d43-976b-80a13b4cfb21.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The <strong>IBM Cloud console</strong> is the user interface that you use to manage all of your IBM Cloud resources. When you access the console, you can manage your account, log in, access the documentation, access the catalog, view the pricing information, get support, or check the status of IBM Cloud components.</p>
<p>After you log in, the <strong>menu bar</strong> contains a Navigation Menu icon and additional links, depending on your account type. </p>
<p>From the console, you can perform the following tasks: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Navigation Menu icon to access all existing resources on your dashboard </li>
<li>Use the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> link to create new resources </li>
<li>Use the <span class="packt_screen">Docs</span> link to access useful information about IBM Cloud</li>
<li>From the <span class="packt_screen">Support</span> menu, you can access information about what's new in IBM Cloud, the support center, options for adding and viewing tickets, and the status page</li>
<li>From the <span class="packt_screen">Manage</span> menu, you can access your account, billing and usage information, and security options </li>

<p>Through the IBM Cloud dashboard or console, you can view and work with <strong>IBM Cloud resources</strong> and <span class="packt_screen">Cloud Foundry</span><strong> s</strong>ervice instances. We'll dive deeper into these in later chapters, but for now, you can think of a resource as anything that can be created, managed, and contained within a resource group. Some examples include apps, service instances, container clusters, storage volumes, and virtual servers.</p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you'll see the top portion of the console: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5d4f046f-03fc-4295-939b-48396e209355.png"/></div>
<p>Rather than walking you through the entire list of functions and features here, we are going to focus on the areas of the cloud that will help jumpstart our ML project development. The IBM Cloud offers neat developer dashboards (accessible from the Navigate Menu icon in the upper left of the console page), each focusing on a different area of interest (such as <span class="packt_screen">Watson</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Security</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Finance</span>) or a digital channel (such as <span class="packt_screen">Mobile</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Web Apps</span>).</p>
<p>The menu list of developer dashboards is shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c3614ecd-c1ba-439b-9170-3b3a6d78ae93.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Each developer dashboard provides various starter kits that are applicable to the dashboard's focus area, offering a consistent, intuitive workflow, which then helps you create a working app solution in minutes. </p>

<p>Selecting Watson from the list of starter kits offered opens the <span class="packt_screen">Build with Watson</span> page, the upper portion of which is shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91 image-border" src="assets/3bc3723c-ebf0-42d2-b084-864d4b082a13.png" style=""/></div>
<p>This page is organized into sections, namely <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Starter Kits</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Watson Services</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Developer Resources</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Apps</span>. If you click on <span class="packt_screen">Watson Services</span>, then <span class="packt_screen">Browse Services</span>, the current Watson-related services that are offered are presented as panels, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92 image-border" src="assets/8d6f435f-d3b1-422b-9e35-a78c692788cf.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>At this point, we need to find a service instance we want to use. To select a service offering, you can click on the panel that you are interested in (for example, <span class="packt_screen">Machine Learning</span>). To make sure that this is the offering you want, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> and read through the service description, including its features list and other relevant information (as shown in the following screenshot) before clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Create</span>: </p>

<p>To build Watson-based projects, you'll want to access the IBM Watson Studio.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You'll access the IBM Watson Studio from the Cloud <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span> menu (using the URL given in the preceding <em>Accessing the IBM Cloud</em> section).</div>
<p><strong>IBM Watson Studio</strong> is an integrated environment designed to make it easy to develop, train, and manage models, as well as deploy AI-powered applications. You can use the neural network modeler and deep learning experiments in Watson Studio to solve the most challenging and computationally intensive problems with clarity and ease. You'll need your IBM ID to set this up.</p>
<p>There are currently three versions of Watson Studio, namely <strong>Cloud</strong>, <strong>Desktop</strong>, and <strong>Local</strong>, each offering a solution based on where you want to perform your work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Watson Studio Cloud</strong>: Your models reside in the IBM public cloud</li>
<li><strong>Watson Studio Desktop</strong>: Your models reside on your desktop</li>
<li><strong>Watson Studio Local</strong>: Your models reside either on your private local area network or on a private<span> IBM</span> cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, we will initially focus on Watson Studio Cloud.</p>

<p>Once the setup is done, you'll find that the Watson Studio Cloud format is similar to other IBM sites we've worked with (IBM Watson Analytics and the Cloud console, for example): </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96 image-border" src="assets/343db473-cedd-4282-a4a8-f5257d4ca820.png" style=""/></div>
<p>All of the versions of Watson Studio provide you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively working with data. You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, cleanse and shape data, ingest streaming data, or to create, train, and deploy ML models. </p>

<p>The architecture of Watson Studio is centered around the concept of a project. A project is where you organize your resources and work with data. The most important resources in a project include collaborators (your users, categorized by security roles), data assets (these point to the data to be used in the project), and various analytical assets and tools (where you derive insights from data). </p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Some interesting tools are provided, which we will touch on later in this book, such as the Streams Designer, the Data Refinery, RStudio, and so on. You can also bring in data and analytic assets from the IBM Watson Community. </div>
<p>You'll find that the Watson Studio main or home page (sometimes referred to as a panel rather than a page) is organized nicely into the following sections: </p>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="packt_screen">Get started</span> section (shown in the previous screenshot) where you can click on panels to create a (new) project or catalog.</li>
<li>A last or <span class="packt_screen">Recently updated projects</span> section where you can see links to the projects you have access to or create new projects by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">New Project</span>: </li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97 image-border" src="assets/e63c9808-4b30-4869-acdc-a3d327abce94.png" style=""/></div>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="packt_screen">Your catalogs</span> section, where you can see the links to the catalogs that you have access to; you can also create a new one:</li>
</ul>

<li>A <span class="packt_screen">Watson services</span> section where you can see the list of active services and tools you have been using or add a new service:</li>
</ul>

<p>What we need to do before we set up a project is ask ourselves: do we want to create a new project or reuse an existing project? Next, do we want to create a new Watson Machine Learning service instance or reuse one we already have? </p>

<p>Simply put, to review what we already went over, to set up our first new project, we need to click on the <span class="packt_screen">IBM Watson</span> link in the header area of the main page to navigate to the <span class="packt_screen">IBM Watson Studio</span> home panel. We will then perform the following steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">New Project</span>. </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Choose a project type: 
<ul>
<li>If you want to train complex neural networks using experiments, choose a <em><span class="packt_screen">Deep Learning</span></em> project</li>
<li>For all other machine learning work, choose the <span class="packt_screen">Modeler</span> <span>project type</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>If you don't have any of the required services already, such as <span class="packt_screen">Watson Machine Learning</span> and <span class="packt_screen">I</span><span class="packt_screen">BM Cloud Object Storage</span>, new service instances are created. </li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, we could dig further into each of the administrative areas of IBM Watson Studio, but the objective of this book is more outcome oriented and hands-on, so perhaps the best next step is to have a look at a small but concrete project, which we will do in the next section.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Let's get started with a simple project!</p>
<p>As always, you begin any project with a statement of the project's objectives. In this project, the objective is to use a simple text file (<kbd>TripRuns.csv</kbd>), which contains results from a professional driving services organization, to show how easy it is to create a simple visual analytics dashboard with IBM Watson Studio. </p>
<div class="packt_infobox">With an analytics dashboard, you can build sophisticated visualizations of analytics results, communicate insights based upon those results on the dashboard, and then easily share the dashboard with others. Cognos Dashboard Embedded uses the dashboard functionality from IBM Cognos Analytics. You can learn more about how to use the dashboard by visiting the following URL: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.ug_ca_dshb.doc/wa_dashboard_discoveryset_intro.html">https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.ug_ca_dshb.doc/wa_dashboard_discoveryset_intro.html</a>. </div>
<p>Now that we have our project objective stated and clearly in mind, we need to follow these step-by-step instructions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">New Project</span>.<span class="packt_screen"> </span></li>
<li>Next, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create a project</span> page. Choose a project starter (required services are provisioned automatically. You can add other assets and services later). For this example project, we will select <span class="packt_screen">Business Analytics</span> by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Create Project</span>,<span class="packt_screen"> </span>as shown in the following screenshot: </li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102 image-border" src="assets/e149f968-9bb2-4088-885c-f644caa8cefc.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Next, you need to select a region <span>from the drop-down list </span>where your project instance will reside (I've selected <span class="packt_screen">US South</span>): </li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103 image-border" src="assets/13030114-e97b-4bc1-b463-1d2c6dfc883e.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>After clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Select</span>, the <span class="packt_screen">New project</span> page, which is shown in the following screenshot, allows you to provide the appropriate project details before clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Create</span>: </li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104 image-border" src="assets/fef82477-bfcb-49e2-a3e0-bb29642623a0.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_infobox">Enter a name and description under <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description.</span> For this example project you can leave the project, options and <span class="packt_screen">Storage</span> and<span class="packt_screen"> </span><span class="packt_screen">Cognos Dashboard Embedded</span> information as shown in the preceding screenshot. </div>
<p>Once the project is created, we'll have a workspace where we can organize the assets that the project will use. There are many assets (data, collaborators, and analytic tools), but we need to start with the data. To load data into our project workspace, we can use either a direct database connector or simply drag and drop a file onto the landing zone (you can also browse to your file). </p>
<p>For our simple example, we are using a text file as our data source, so in the upper right of the project workspace page, you can click on the <strong>Find and add data</strong> icon, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105 image-border" src="assets/06df300f-2767-4654-8f93-70cd427e9c7f.png" style=""/></div>
<p>From there, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Load</span> and browse to locate and select the file that you want to use in the project <span>(ours is </span><kbd>TripRuns.csv</kbd><span>)</span>. After the file has loaded, you then click on <span class="packt_screen">Files</span> and you should see the file listed and ready to use: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106 image-border" src="assets/f302b742-35a0-4100-a489-4a7860c746ce.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Now that we have some data to work with, we can click on the menu selection <span class="packt_screen">Add to project</span>, and then select <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span>: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8a912a5f-fcc3-4c14-b394-eb4cf4ef2b87.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After you select <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span>, you'll have to provide a name and description under <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>, and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108 image-border" src="assets/a663e843-131c-4dd6-9e77-9b6788404816.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After IBM Watson sets up the new dashboard for your project, you can customize it, starting with its general layout. You can start by selecting a preformatted template: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109 image-border" src="assets/6201a307-7e86-43e4-82e6-44477c094435.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Once you select a template (I selected <span class="packt_screen">Tabbed</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Freeform</span>), you'll find yourself on the dashboard canvas (shown in the following screenshot), where we can design your dashboard: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-110 image-border" src="assets/d3e69e1d-488c-4a12-b12e-d3dffc5e91c0.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Next, click on the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon near <span class="packt_screen">Selected sources</span> in the upper left-hand corner of the page: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-111 image-border" src="assets/be1c6dfc-ff10-4145-93aa-64f513e68b10.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After clicking the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon, you can then select the <kbd>TripRuns.csv</kbd> data asset that we previously added to our project:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/78717f73-13de-4ebc-abb8-75a1b8019c1f.png" style=""/></div>
<p>If you're wondering what <span class="packt_screen">Connections</span> is, that is where you would define any data assets that are in the form of a direct connection to a database or other source. A <strong>connection asset</strong> contains the information that's required to create a connection to a data source. You create connections to IBM (or other) cloud services and on-premises databases.</p>
<p>After selecting our data asset, it should show up, as shown in the following screenshot. Now we are ready to proceed with constructing our dashboard:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ce14d935-ade3-4dd9-bfbe-319eccb15d7b.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">When you hover over the eye icon next to a data asset, you will notice that Watson Studio gives you the option of doing a quick review of the data asset just by clicking on the eye icon. This comes in handy when working with multiple data assets, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114 image-border" src="assets/bed41ecc-d80e-4eb3-bb50-32732951220a.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Since we are ready to proceed, we can just click on our data asset name (rather than the eye icon) and then click the button at the bottom right of the page with the caption <span class="packt_screen">Select</span>. The dashboard canvas page is displayed once more. Notice that the page is split into two sections, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122 image-border" src="assets/945dfa46-4e83-430c-8696-25a2b8b24ecb.png" style=""/></div>
<p>On the right is the drawing space or canvas and on the left is the menu pane, which consists of three icons: <span class="packt_screen">Select sources</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Visualizations</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span>. We have already set up our data source, so let's click on <span class="packt_screen">Visualizations</span>. The visualization selector is displayed, where you can select the type of visualization that you want to use on your analytics dashboard:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-116 image-border" src="assets/68093369-cef4-4207-9072-395bbafafff7.png" style=""/></div>
<p>To keep this example simple, we just chose <span class="packt_screen">Bar</span> as the visualization type by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Bar</span> icon. A <span class="packt_screen">Build your visualization</span> template will be added to your canvas, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125 image-border" src="assets/8dfbeb84-1b97-4aca-9a20-d8060d1bfe7b.png" style=""/></div>
<p>From there, we can drag and drop columns of data into the desired visualization parameters, such as <span class="packt_screen">Bars</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Length</span>. Note that the required parameters are denoted by a red asterisk.</p>
<p>As with most Watson visualization interfaces, as you add or remove the parameter values, the visualization is updated in real time: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-121 image-border" src="assets/bd35bdc5-90d7-43b8-8d5a-2930a8e9a307.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Once you are satisfied with your visualization, you can click the Save icon (located on the dashboard action bar) to save your dashboard. The dashboard that you have created is listed in the <span class="packt_screen">Dashboards</span> section on the project's <span class="packt_screen">Assets</span> page. </p>
<p>From the dashboard action bar, you are able to do the following tasks: </p>
<ul>
<li>Download the dashboard as a JSON file</li>
<li>Create a permanent dashboard URL to share with others</li>
<li>Undo/redo actions that have been performed on the dashboard</li>
<li>Save the dashboard</li>
<li>Add/remove widget connections</li>
<li>Change dashboard properties, such as colors</li>
<li>View your dashboard details, such as name and description, or choose an alternate <span class="packt_screen">Cognos Dashboard Embedded</span> service instance if multiple services are associated with the project</li>
<li>Find resources in the community, for example, useful datasets</li>
</ul>

<p>In this chapter, we got started by introducing the IBM Cloud environment and how to access it for the first time. In addition, we used the IBM Watson console to illustrate how a project is created. </p>
<p>Finally, we reviewed tasks such as adding a new dataset asset to a project and creating a simple analytics dashboard with our data in minutes, without any need for programming.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look into feature extraction.</p>
