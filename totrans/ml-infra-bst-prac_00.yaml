- en: Machine learning has gained a lot of popularity in recent years. The introduction
    of large language models such as GPT-3 and 4 only increased the speed of the development
    of this field. These large language models have become so powerful that it is
    almost impossible to train them on a local computer. However, this is not necessary
    at all. These language models provide the ability to create new tools without
    the need to train them because they can be steered by the context window and the
    prompt.

- en: In this book, my goal is to show how machine learning models can be trained,
    evaluated, and tested – both in the context of a small prototype and in the context
    of a fully-fledged software product. The primary objective of this book is to
    bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation of machine
    learning in software engineering. It aims to equip you with the skills necessary
    to not only understand but also effectively implement and innovate with AI and
    machine learning technologies in your professional pursuits.

    a solid foundation for those new to the field. As we progress, the focus shifts
    to the infrastructure – the backbone of any successful machine learning project.
    From data collection and processing to model training and deployment, each step
    is crucial and requires careful consideration and planning.

    are not just theoretical guidelines but are derived from real-life experiences
    and case studies that my research team discovered during our work in this field.
    These best practices offer invaluable insights into handling common pitfalls and
    ensuring the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of machine learning systems.

    We explore the theories behind ethics in machine learning, look closer into the
    licensing of data and models, and finally, explore the practical frameworks that
    can quantify bias in data and models in machine learning.

    demand expertise in mathematics or statistics. This approach ensures accessibility
    to a broader range of professionals and enthusiasts in the software development
    domain. For those of you without prior experience in Python, this book necessitates
    acquiring a basic understanding of the language. However, the material is structured
    to facilitate a rapid and comprehensive grasp of Python essentials. Conversely,
    for those proficient in Python but not yet seasoned in professional programming,
    this book serves as a valuable resource for transitioning into the realm of software
    engineering with a focus on AI and ML applications.

    to Traditional Software*, explores where these two types of software systems are
    most appropriate. We learn about the software development processes that programmers
    use to create both types of software and we also learn about the classical four
    types of machine learning software – rule-based, supervised, unsupervised, and
    reinforcement learning. Finally, we also learn about the different roles of data
    in traditional and machine learning software.'

    System*, reviews each element of a professional machine learning system. We start
    by understanding which elements are important and why. Then, we explore how to
    create such elements and how to work by putting them together into a single machine
    learning system – the so-called machine learning pipeline.'

    – Text, Images, Code, and Features*, introduces three data types – images, texts,
    and formatted text (program source code). We explore how each of these types of
    data can be used in machine learning, how they should be annotated, and for what
    purpose. Introducing these three types of data provides us with the possibility
    to explore different ways of annotating these sources of data.'

    and Noise*, dives deeper into topics related to data quality. We go through a
    theoretical model for assessing data quality and we provide methods and tools
    to operationalize it. We also look into the concept of noise in machine learning
    and how to reduce it by using different tokenization methods.'

    Data Properties*, dives deeper into the properties of data and how to improve
    them. In contrast to the previous chapter, we work on feature vectors rather than
    raw data. The feature vectors are already a transformation of the data; therefore,
    we can change such properties as noise or even change how the data is perceived.
    We focus on the processing of text, which is an important part of many machine
    learning algorithms nowadays. We start by understanding how to transform data
    into feature vectors using simple algorithms, such as bag of words, so that we
    can work on feature vectors.'

    Learning Systems*, dives deeper into the ways in which data and algorithms are
    entangled. We talk a lot about data in generic terms, but in this chapter, we
    explain what kind of data is needed in machine learning systems. We explain the
    fact that all kinds of data are used in numerical form – either as a feature vector
    or as more complex feature matrices. Then, we will explain the need to transform
    unstructured data (e.g., text) into structured data. This chapter will lay the
    foundations for going deeper into each type of data, which is the content of the
    next few chapters.'

    and Image Data*, focuses on the feature engineering process for numerical and
    image data. We start by going through the typical methods such as **Principal
    Component Analysis** (**PCA**), which we used previously for visualization. We
    then move on to more advanced methods such as the **t-Student Distribution Stochastic
    Network Embeddings** (**t-SNE**) and **Independent Component Analysis** (**ICA**).
    What we end up with is the use of autoencoders as a dimensionality reduction technique
    for both numerical and image data.'

    so powerful – feature extraction from natural language data. Natural language
    is a special kind of data source in software engineering. With the introduction
    of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, it became evident that machine learning and artificial
    intelligence tools for software engineering tasks are no longer science fiction.'

    Systems – Feature-Based and Raw Data-Based (Deep Learning)*, explores different
    types of machine learning systems. We start from classical machine learning models
    such as random forest and we move on to convolutional and GPT models, which are
    called deep learning models. Their name comes from the fact that they use raw
    data as input and the first layers of the models include feature extraction layers.
    They are also designed to progressively learn more abstract features as the input
    data moves through these models. This chapter demonstrates each of these types
    of models and progresses from classical machine learning to the generative AI
    models.'

    and then we show how they are trained. We start with the classical machine learning

    (BERT). These models are designed to generate new data based on the patterns that

    also explain the problems with using open source data and revealing the identities

    us to integrate them into workflows in a very flexible way. Instead of compiling
    or using dynamically linked libraries, we can deploy machine learning components
    that communicate over HTTP protocols using JSON protocols. In fact, we have already
    seen how to use that protocol by using the GPT-3 model that is hosted by OpenAI.
    In this chapter, we explore the possibility of creating our own Docker container
    with a pre-trained machine learning model, deploying it, and integrating it with
