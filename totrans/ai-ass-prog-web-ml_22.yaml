    that you’re now at a point where you can confidently use AI tools like GitHub
    Copilot and ChatGPT in your projects.

- en: Let’s recap on what we’ve covered in this book. We started by introducing you
    to the world of AI and how we got to **large language models** (**LLMs**). We
    then introduced you to GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, two of the most popular AI
    tools in the world today. Not only are these two tools popular, but they’re also
    interesting to compare and contrast. ChatGPT comes with a chat interface and is
    built so that it can tackle a range of tasks. GitHub Copilot also comes with a
    chat interface and an in-editor mode but is more dedicated to solving problems
    around software development. An important aspect that unites these two tools is
    the fact you can use prompts and natural language input, they can be used as input,
    and the end user receives an output that hopefully brings them closer to solving
    their problem. Because both of these two tools rely on prompt input, it allows
    us to decide what type of prompts and how many prompts are needed, tweak the prompts,
    and even use prompts to validate the AI tool’s response.

    effectively. After that, we showed how this prompt strategy was put into practice
    in a web development project spanning from the frontend to the backend over several
    chapters. We then showed how the very same prompt strategy applied to data science
    and machine learning projects. These two problem domains have been chosen at random;
    the point of the book is to demonstrate the capability of generative AI tools,
    and knowing how to pair that with a prompt strategy will greatly empower you.

- en: The impact of using an AI tool is that you now have a tool that does much of
    the heavy lifting around code development regardless of the problem domain. What
    this means for you as a developer is that you can now focus to a higher degree
    on being declarative, to state how you want things rather than typing every line
    of code. Using AI tools and using them efficiently is likely to speed up the coding
    part of your job considerably.

    namely agents, which are programs that can act on your behalf and represent where
    we think AI is headed next.

    AI to do much of the heavy lifting for you. Your new role is to work with your
    AI tool iteratively for the best results.

    chosen domain regardless of whether you’re a web developer, data scientist, or
    machine learning engineer.

- en: Prompting is quickly becoming a skill in its own right, even if we think that
    improved models will make it less important in the future. For now, it’s a skill
    that you should master, and we hope this book is helping you on this road to becoming
    proficient in prompting.

    going, and you should keep an eye on that. Agents are already part of the curriculum
    at the University of Oxford; check out this course link to learn more [https://conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-cloud-and-mlops-online](https://conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-cloud-and-mlops-online).

    introduces agents. We recommend having a look at it and, if so inclined, leveraging
    it in your own projects: [https://github.com/microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen).'

    might not be the best ones in a few months. It’s therefore our ambition to keep
    this book updated with the latest findings and insights. A heartfelt thanks to
    you, dear reader, and we hope this book has proved valuable to you.
