<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence has capabilities to better leverage the Workspace ONE platform with data-based actions and resolution from a single repository. Users want to access their corporate data and applications from anywhere on any device. Security tools are not able to take care of end user requirements and security risks in a proactive way in the current environment. Customers can't get complete insight into device, application, and user data due to the always-changing perimeter ( Location of End User's Device ) which creates big cybersecurity threats and complicates the management task.</p>
<p>Every organization has to take care of their employees as well as not compromise security. Employee productivity is affected by application execution issues and irregular services. It will be affected by frequent changes in application access by <span><span>reducing</span></span> privileges. We have to find a way around security and user's productivity and avoid a complicated management process by using intelligent data analysis and automation. We also need a solution for frequently-changing threat areas, which can integrate with all relevant services and provide assurance on security aspects in the current digital workspace system.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence is a cloud service built on the Workspace ONE platform, which helps customers with great graphics, user interface tools, and an intelligent process, to take data-driven decisions from a single source of truth. Workspace ONE Intelligence helps to filter and find <strong>key performance indicators</strong> (<strong>KPIs</strong>) on demand by collecting, examining, and connecting device, application, and user data. As it gets the required data information, it then can leverage the built-in rule engine to automate policies that can make moves based on broad metrics. Customers can define rules that can make intelligent remediation moves as per context. AI and ML techniques can be utilized for suggested actions and future-planning for an entire digital workspace system that customers can manage without compromising the end user's productivity.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity in the mobile cloud era needs a comprehensive enterprise security strategy and approach. The Workspace ONE Intelligence compliance engine continuously monitors devices and performs escalating actions to prevent noncompliance<span><span>.</span></span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Customer cha</strong><strong>llenge</strong>: Known vulnerabilities are discovered, such as Spectre or Meltdown. Each manufacturer quickly release OS updates but manufacturers vary in how they implement fixes. Each OS has its own update schedule and update version; iOS uses OS version, while Android uses security patches. IT admins are not able to determine impacted mobile devices and deploy fixes across their entire environment.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence can help to q<span>uickly assess and report on the impact of a threat or vulnerability, and share these reports with management and IT teams across the organization. It e</span><span>asily identifies assets with known vulnerabilities by creating a visualization of all devices with an out-of-date OS version (iOS) or old security patch date (Google). It s</span><span>egments the data by organization group, device type, or model to see which devices are the most out of date and most vulnerable. It leverages </span><span>automation to target vulnerable devices and add actions to force OS update (iOS-supervised devices only), notify the end user via email or Slack, notify the InfoSec team of the most vulnerable devices, move devices to an org group with stricter access requirements, and m</span><span>onitor how many devices have been patched or upgraded across Android and iOS.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key bene</strong><strong>fits</strong>: This increases security hygiene across the organization, increases compliance, and increases collaboration between the IT ops and InfoSec teams.</p>

<p><strong>Customer challenge</strong>:<strong> </strong>A big challenge for IT is to understand how many users have devices that are no longer supported by the organization and can be security risks. Another challenge for IT, especially for organizations that are building their own applications, is the lack of visibility into device and OS distribution across the organization.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence can help to i<span>dentify devices that are too old to upgrade to the latest OS and are exposed to the latest security threats and c</span><span>reate a report or a widget on a dashboard that identifies devices that are potential end-of-life candidates. It gives</span><span> visibility into most popular device types among users, recommends new hardware to employees, and e</span><span>asily communicates device and OS version adoption to app developers to ensure they are building for the most popular device/OS combinations and maximize adoption of their in-house applications. It q</span><span>uickly determines which device and OS versions to stop supporting based on usage.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key benefits</strong>: This can optimize development efforts, understand user needs per geography, save time, and increase productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Customer challenge</strong>: Every year, Apple and Google release new major OS updates that include new UEM features for better management, and new usability features that administrators want their end users to take control of to improve productivity. When a major OS releases, administrators need near-real-time visibility into how an OS version is adopted so they can forecast how long they have to pilot new features and to determine when is a good time to deploy the new UEM feature (for example, security policy) to all of their devices.</p>
<p> Workspace ONE Intelligence can help to c<span>reate a dashboard to monitor the adoption of old and new OSes and m</span><span>onitor the increase of devices reporting the latest version of an OS while seeing the decrease of devices reporting the previous version. It also c</span><span>ompares OS adoption between different vendors year after year, and f</span><span>orecasts when a major OS release will reach the majority of their devices.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key benefits</strong>: This can help to make informed decisions about the entire environment, give quantitative insights to app developers, and prioritize feature development based on OS distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Customer challenge</strong>: In business use cases, devices have a single or multi-purpose use, where they are either shared by a group of users, as in retail stores, or dedicated to one user, such as an electronic flight bag for an airline pilot. In either case, IT needs visibility to ensure that all of these assets are online and active. In retail, stores with devices that are inactive are most likely stolen. Airline pilots can't fly without their devices, so there should be almost zero inactive devices.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence can help IT teams<span> get visibility into understanding where and what stores have the most inactive devices and u</span><span>se automation to notify store managers of potentially stolen devices. It also helps </span><span>to create tickets (ServiceNow) and deploy devices in need to the right location, and u</span><span>se dashboards to monitor the types of devices most used across the organization or per location. It also u</span><span>ses intelligence to make data-informed decisions when the time comes to purchase new devices.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key benefits</strong>: This can help to improve store performance, increase efficiencies within an organization, and optimize resources.</p>

<p><strong>Customer</strong> <strong>challenge</strong>: As an IT administrator, deploying an app update is critical to meet business and security needs. Sometimes, there is only a small window of opportunity to deploy applications. In retail, it can only be in the middle of the night; for security, it's as soon as possible; and for 24-hour healthcare workers, there may not be a good time to push an update. </p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence can help to g<span>et visibility on the best time to deploy an app based on usage patterns and a</span><span>ccurately report on how a deployment is going. It also gives information about app adoption, app engagement in real time to app development teams, management and the helpdesk by providing full 360 degree view of any application. It g</span><span>ets insights into app performance per device manufacturer, model, or OS version by q</span><span>uickly detecting the root cause of deployment issues or poor app adoption. </span><span>Devices on older app versions can be notified to update to the latest version and app developers can stop maintaining older versions when the user base is low. It l</span><span>everages automation actions to remediate issues, such as notifying store managers of an issue </span><span>to redeploy a previous release of the app if the new version is not stable.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key benefits</strong>: This can reduce costs linked to user-generated support tickets or calls and increase employee experience and productivity. Help developers prioritize features and get insights into older app versions that can be retired.</p>
