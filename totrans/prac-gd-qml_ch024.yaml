    numbers and ![i^{2} = - 1](img/file543.png "i^{2} = - 1"). This might not be the

    part**, which we denote as ![{Re}z](img/file1499.png "{Re}z"), is ![a](img/file16.png

    = (a,b)](img/file1501.png "({Re}z,{Im}z) = (a,b)"). The length of the resulting

    if you want to get the conjugate of any complex number, all you have to do is
    flip the sign of its imaginary part. It is easy to check that, given any complex
