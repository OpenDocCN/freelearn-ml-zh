<p class="mce-root">Machine learning has made a huge impact not only in academia, but also in industry, by turning data into actionable intelligence. Scala is not only an object-oriented and functional programming language, but can also leverage the advantages of <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong>JVM</strong>). Scala provides code complexity optimization and offers concise notation, which is probably the reason it has seen a steady rise in adoption over the last few years, especially in data science and analytics.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book is aimed at aspiring data scientists, data engineers, and deep learning enthusiasts who are newbies and want to have a great head start at machine learning best practices. Even if you're not well versed in machine learning concepts, but still want to expand your knowledge by delving into practical implementations of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems with Scala, you will be able to grasp the content easily!</p>
<p class="mce-root">Throughout the chapters, you'll become acquainted with popular machine learning libraries in Scala, learning how to carry out regression and classification analysis using both linear methods and tree-based ensemble techniques, as well as looking at clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction, and recommender systems, before delving into deep learning at the end.</p>
<p class="mce-root">After reading this book, you will have a good head start in solving more complex machine learning tasks. This book isn't meant to be read cover to cover. You can turn the pages to a chapter that looks like something you're trying to accomplish or that ignites your interest.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Suggestions for i<span>mprovement </span>are always welcome. Happy reading!</p>

<p>All the examples have been implemented in Scala with some open source libraries, including Apahe Spark MLlib/ML and Deeplearning4j. However, to get the best out of this, you should have a powerful computer and software stack.</p>
<p><span>A Linux distribution is preferable (for example, Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS). For example, for Ubuntu, it is recommended to have at least a 14.04 (LTS) 64-bit complete installation on VMware Workstation Player 12 or VirtualBox. You can run Spark jobs on Windows (7/8/10) or macOS X (10.4.7+) as well.</span></p>
<p><span>A computer with a Core i5 processor, enough storage (for example, for running Spark jobs, you'll need at least 50 GB of free disk storage for standalone cluster and for the SQL warehouse), and at least 16 GB RAM are recommended. And optionally, if you want to perform the neural network training on the GPU (for the last chapter only), the NVIDIA GPU driver has to be installed with CUDA and CuDNN configured.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>It gave me a Matthews correlation coefficient of </span><kbd>0.3888239300421191</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>rawTrafficDF.select("Hour (Coded)", "Immobilized bus", "Broken Truck", <br/>                    "Vehicle excess", "Fire", "Slowness in traffic (%)").show(5)</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>// Create a decision tree estimator<br/><strong>val</strong> dt = <strong>new</strong> DecisionTreeClassifier()<br/>      .setImpurity("gini")<br/>      .setMaxBins(10)<br/>      .setMaxDepth(30)<br/>      .setLabelCol("label")<br/>      .setFeaturesCol("features")</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root"><strong> +-----+-----+</strong><br/><strong> |churn|count|</strong><br/><strong> +-----+-----+</strong><br/><strong> |False| 2278|</strong><br/><strong> | True| 388 |</strong><br/><strong> +-----+-----+</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
