    <h1 class="chaptertitle" id="_idParaDest-487">Conclusion</h1>
    <p class="normal">Huge thanks to you, dear reader, for getting this far into the book. We hope that you’re now at a point where you can confidently use AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT in your projects.</p>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-488">Recap of the book</h1>
    <p class="normal">Let’s recap on what we’ve covered in this book. We started by introducing you to the world of AI and how we got to <strong class="screentext">large language models</strong> (<strong class="screentext">LLMs</strong>). We then introduced you to GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, two of the most popular AI tools in the world today. Not only are these two tools popular, but they’re also interesting to compare and contrast. ChatGPT comes with a chat interface and is built so that it can tackle a range of tasks. GitHub Copilot also comes with a chat interface and an in-editor mode but is more dedicated to solving problems around software development. An important aspect that unites these two tools is the fact you can use prompts and natural language input, they can be used as input, and the end user receives an output that hopefully brings them closer to solving their problem. Because both of these two tools rely on prompt input, it allows us to decide what type of prompts and how many prompts are needed, tweak the prompts, and even use prompts to validate the AI tool’s response.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Then, we presented you with a prompt strategy to ensure you use these AI tools effectively. After that, we showed how this prompt strategy was put into practice in a web development project spanning from the frontend to the backend over several chapters. We then showed how the very same prompt strategy applied to data science and machine learning projects. These two problem domains have been chosen at random; the point of the book is to demonstrate the capability of generative AI tools, and knowing how to pair that with a prompt strategy will greatly empower you. </p>
    <p class="normal1">The impact of using an AI tool is that you now have a tool that does much of the heavy lifting around code development regardless of the problem domain. What this means for you as a developer is that you can now focus to a higher degree on being declarative, to state how you want things rather than typing every line of code. Using AI tools and using them efficiently is likely to speed up the coding part of your job considerably.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Before rounding up the book, we presented you with a glimpse of the future, namely agents, which are programs that can act on your behalf and represent where we think AI is headed next.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Finally, we covered the AI tools and their features more in detail to set you up for success in your future projects.</p>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-489">Major conclusions</h1>
    <p class="normal">So, what are the major conclusions that can be drawn from this book? They are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist">AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are here to stay and are only going to get better with time.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">The world is shifting toward a more declarative way of programming; ask the AI to do much of the heavy lifting for you. Your new role is to work with your AI tool iteratively for the best results.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">You should have a prompt strategy in place to approach problems within your chosen domain regardless of whether you’re a web developer, data scientist, or machine learning engineer.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Prompting is quickly becoming a skill in its own right, even if we think that improved models will make it less important in the future. For now, it’s a skill that you should master, and we hope this book is helping you on this road to becoming proficient in prompting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-490">What’s next</h1>
    <p class="normal">What we discussed in our chapter on agents (<em class="italic">Chapter 21</em>) is where things are going, and you should keep an eye on that. Agents are already part of the curriculum at the University of Oxford; check out this course link to learn more <a href="https://conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-cloud-and-mlops-online" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">https://conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-cloud-and-mlops-online</span></a>.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Autogen, as mentioned in <em class="italic">Chapter 21</em>, is a highly interesting project that introduces agents. We recommend having a look at it and, if so inclined, leveraging it in your own projects: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">https://github.com/microsoft/autogen</span></a>.</p>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-491">At last</h1>
    <p class="normal">The world of AI is moving quickly. Yesterday’s perfect tools and strategies might not be the best ones in a few months. It’s therefore our ambition to keep this book updated with the latest findings and insights. A heartfelt thanks to you, dear reader, and we hope this book has proved valuable to you.</p>
