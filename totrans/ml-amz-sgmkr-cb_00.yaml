    This book helps you address **machine learning** (**ML**) challenges with DataRobot's
    enterprise platform, enabling you to extract business value from data and rapidly
    generate commercial impact for your organization.

- en: You'll begin by learning how to use DataRobot's features to perform data prep
    and cleansing tasks automatically. The book covers best practices for building
    and deploying ML models, along with challenges faced while scaling them to handle
    complex business problems. Moving on, you'll perform **exploratory data analysis**
    (**EDA**) tasks to prepare your data to build ML models and ways to interpret
    results. You'll also discover how to analyze the model's predictions and turn
    them into actionable insights for business users. After that, you'll create model
    documentation for internal as well as compliance purposes and learn how the model
    gets deployed as an API. In addition, you'll find out how to operationalize and
    monitor the model's performance. Finally, you'll work with examples of time series
    forecasting, NLP, image processing, MLOps, and more using advanced DataRobot capabilities.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17159_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *What Is DataRobot
    and Why You Need It*, describes the current practices and process of building
    and deploying ML models, and some of the challenges in scaling that approach.
    This chapter will then describe what DataRobot is and how DataRobot addresses
    many of these challenges, thus allowing analysts and data scientists to quickly
    add value to their organization. This also helps executives understand how they
    can use DataRobot to efficiently scale their data science practice without a need
    to hire a large staff with hard-to-find skills. This chapter also describes various
    components of DataRobot, how it is architected, how it integrates with other tools,
    and different options to set it up on-premises or in the cloud. It also describes,
    at a high level, various user interface components and what they signify.'

    Basics*, covers some basic concepts of ML that will be used and referenced in
    this book. This is the bare minimum you need to know to use DataRobot effectively.
    It is not the intent of this chapter to give you a comprehensive understanding
    of ML, but just a refresher of some key ideas.'

    and Defining Business Problems*, will show you examples of how to get to the root
    of a problem and then set it up as an ML project. A business problem needs to
    be carefully defined and turned into an ML problem for it to be solved with DataRobot.
    This is a critical step that is often ignored, resulting in problems and failures
    downstream. Please review this chapter carefully to prevent the wastage of a lot
    of hard work. This chapter is tool- and ML method-agnostic.'

    for DataRobot*, covers how to stitch data together from multiple disparate sources
    at a high level. Depending on the data, DataRobot might perform data prep and
    cleansing tasks automatically, or you might have to do some of these on your own.
    This chapter covers concepts and examples to show how to cleanse and prepare your
    data and the features that DataRobot provides to help with these tasks.'

    The commercial version has all the functionality. If you do not have access to
    a commercial version, you can get an evaluation version that works for a limited
    time and does not have all the capabilities discussed. For some of the advanced
    capabilities and the API to work, you will need to know some Python and have access
    to an open source Python environment (for instance, Anaconda or Jupyter Notebooks).
