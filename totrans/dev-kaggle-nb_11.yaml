    science, and we have traversed a diverse landscape of challenges, ranging from
    geospatial analysis and natural language processing to image classification and
    time-series forecasting. This expedition has enriched our understanding of how
    to adeptly combine various cutting-edge technologies. We’ve delved into large
    language models, such as those developed by Kaggle, explored vector databases,
    and discovered the efficiency of task chaining frameworks, all to harness the
    transformative potential of generative AI.

    and formats. We’ve engaged in feature engineering, constructed several baseline
    models, and acquired the skill of iteratively refining these models. This process
    is central to mastering the numerous tools and techniques essential for comprehensive
    data analysis.

    We’ve learned not only the techniques but also how to tailor the style and visuals
    to suit each unique dataset and analysis. Additionally, we’ve explored how to
    craft compelling narratives around data, moving beyond mere technical reporting
    to storytelling that brings data to life.

    visualization tools, and customization options. These techniques were effectively
    utilized by myself and numerous other esteemed Kaggle Notebook Grandmasters. My
    journey to becoming the 8th Notebooks Grandmaster and maintaining a top-3 ranking
    for an extended period was not solely the result of in-depth analysis, high-quality
    visuals, or crafting engaging narratives in my notebooks. It was also a testament
    to adhering to a select few best practices.

    Kagglers apart, particularly the Kaggle Notebook Masters and Grandmasters. Let’s
    begin by examining hard evidence from a fascinating dataset: the *Meta Kaggle
    Master Achievements Snapshot*. This dataset (see *Reference 1*) comprises two
    files: one detailing achievements and the other profiling users:'

    **Competition**, **Datasets**, **Notebooks**, and **Discussion** categories, along
    with their highest rank across all these categories. This file exclusively includes
    users who have attained at least the Master tier in one of the four Kaggle categories.

    addresses, countries, geographical coordinates, and metadata extracted from their

    recent activity on the platform, such as “Joined 13 years ago last seen in the
    past day.”

    the platform daily (0 days since last seen means that they were active also on
    the current day). Being present daily is, therefore, an attribute of most of the
    successful Masters and Grandmasters. I can confirm with my personal experience
    that, on my path to becoming a Master and then a Grandmaster, I was almost active
    on the platform daily, creating new notebooks and using them to analyze datasets,
    preparing submissions for competitions as well as performing detailed analyses.

    start working on a new topic. Most of the time, I will return to it several times
    and add new ideas. In the first versions of the notebook, I try to focus on data
    exploration and really understand what is uniquely characteristic about the respective
    dataset (or datasets). In the next versions, I work on refining the graphics and
    extract maybe functions for data preparation, analysis, and visualization. I organize
    the code better, eliminating repetitive parts and eventually saving the generic
    parts in a utility script. The best part of using utility scripts is that you
    now have reusable code that can be used in multiple notebooks. When I create a
    utility script, I take steps to make the code more generic, customizable, and
    robust.

    of the composition, making changes to the style to adapt it better to the story

    stable version, I work further to improve the readability and really try to create
    a good narrative. There is no limit to revisions.

    Even if the comments are irrelevant or even negative, we always need to remain
    calm and composed, trying to get to the bottom of the issue: did we miss an important
    aspect in our analysis? Did we fail to pay the right attention to all data specifics?
    Are we using the right visualization tools? Is our narrative coherent? The best
    answer to a comment is, besides expressing your gratitude, to apply the suggestions

    In *Chapter 4*, we learned to build rather complex graphs with multiple layers

    In *Figure 11.2*, we show one of the original maps. Upon selection of one of the
    Starbucks coffee shops, a popup shows the shop name and address. The map is great,
    but the popup doesn’t look quite right, does it? The text is not aligned, the
    size of the popup is smaller than needed to display all the information, and the
    look and feel don’t really seem aligned with the quality of the map.

    a continuous process of improvement and innovation, drawing on both community
    feedback and the work of others. Regularly revisiting and updating your notebooks
    based on constructive comments demonstrates a commitment to excellence. You can
    also look at what others have done. Just forking their work will not bring you
    too many upvotes. However, if you start from other users’ work and bring new insights
    by expanding their observations and improving on a visualization or interpretation
    of the results, it can help you to rise in the ranks.
