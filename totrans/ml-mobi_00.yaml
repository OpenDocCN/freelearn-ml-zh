- en: This book will help you perform machine learning on mobile with simple practical
    examples. You start from the basics of machine learning, and by the time you complete
    the book, you will have a good grasp of what mobile machine learning is and what
    tools/SDKs are available for implementing mobile machine learning, and will also
    be able to implement various machine learning algorithms in mobile applications
    that can be run in both iOS and Android.

- en: 'You will learn what machine learning is and will understand what is driving
    mobile machine learning and how it is unique. You will be exposed to all the mobile
    machine learning tools and SDKs: TensorFlow Lite, Core ML, ML Kit, and Fritz on
    Android and iOS. This book will explore the high-level architecture and components
    of each toolkit. By the end of the book, you will have a broad understanding of
    machine learning models and will be able to perform on-device machine learning.
    You will get deep-dive insights into machine learning algorithms such as regression,
    classification, linear **support vector machine** (**SVM**), and random forest.
    You will learn how to do natural language processing and implement spam message
    detection. You will learn how to convert existing models created using Core ML
    and TensorFlow into Fritz models. You will also be exposed to neural networks.
    You will also get sneak peek into the future of machine learning, and the book
    also contains an FAQ section to answer all your queries on mobile machine learning.
    It will help you to build an interesting diet application that provides the calorie
    values of food items that are captured on a camera, which runs both in iOS and
    Android.'
