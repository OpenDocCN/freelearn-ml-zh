			<p>Hello there! <em class="italic">The Definitive Guide to Google Vertex AI</em> is a comprehensive guide on accelerating the development and deployment of real-world ML solutions, with the help of the frameworks and best practices offered by Google as part of Vertex AI within <span class="No-Break">Google Cloud.</span></p>
			<p>Developing large-scale ML solutions and managing ML workflows in production is important for every business nowadays. Google has developed a unified data and AI platform, called Google Vertex AI, to help accelerate your ML journey and MLOps tools for <span class="No-Break">workflow management.</span></p>
			<p>This book is a complete guide that lets you explore all the features of Google Vertex AI, from an easy to advanced level, for end-to-end ML solution development. Starting from data management, model building, and experimentation to deployment, the Vertex AI platform provides you with tooling for no-code and low-code as well as fully <span class="No-Break">customized approaches.</span></p>
			<p>This book also provides a hands-on guide to developing and deploying some real-world applications on Google Cloud Platform, using technologies such as computer vision, NLP, and generative AI. Additionally, this book discusses some prebuilt/turnkey solution offerings from Google and shows you how to quickly integrate them into <span class="No-Break">ML projects.</span></p>
