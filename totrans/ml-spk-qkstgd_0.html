<p class="mce-root">Every person and every organization in the world manages data, whether they realize it or not. Data is used to describe the world around us and can be used for almost any purpose, from analyzing consumer habits in order to recommend the latest products and services to fighting disease, climate change, and serious organized crime. Ultimately, we manage data in order to derive value from it, whether personal or business value, and many organizations around the world have traditionally invested in tools and technologies to help them process their data faster and more efficiently in order to deliver actionable insights.</p>
<p class="mce-root">But we now live in a highly interconnected world driven by mass data creation and consumption, where data is no longer rows and columns restricted to a spreadsheet but an organic and evolving asset in its own right. With this realization comes major challenges for organizations as we enter the intelligence-driven fourth industrial revolution—how do we manage the sheer amount of data being created every second in all of its various formats (think not only spreadsheets and databases, but also social media posts, images, videos, music, online forums and articles, computer log files, and more)? And once we know how to manage all of this data, how do we know what questions to ask of it in order to derive real personal or business value?</p>
<p class="mce-root">The focus of this book is to help us answer those questions in a hands-on manner starting from first principles. We introduce the latest cutting-edge technologies (the big data ecosystem, including Apache Spark) that can be used to manage and process big data. We then explore advanced classes of algorithms (machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and cognitive computing) that can be applied to the big data ecosystem to help us uncover previously hidden relationships in order to understand what the data is telling us so that we may ultimately solve real-world challenges.</p>

<p>This book is aimed at business analysts, data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, and software engineers for whom a typical day may currently involve analyzing data using spreadsheets or relational databases, perhaps using VBA, <strong>Structured Query Language</strong> (<strong>SQL</strong>), or even Python to compute statistical aggregations (such as averages) and to generate graphs, charts, pivot tables and other reporting mediums.</p>
<p>With the explosion of data in all of its various formats and frequencies, perhaps you are now challenged with not only managing all of that data, but understanding what it is telling you. You have most likely heard the terms <strong>big data</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong>, but now wish to understand where to start in order to take advantage of these new technologies and frameworks, not just in theory but in practice as well, to solve your business challenges. If this sounds familiar, then this book is for you!</p>

<p>Though this book aims to explain everything from first principles, it would be advantageous (though not strictly required) to have a basic knowledge of mathematical notation and basic programming skills in a language that can be used for data transformation, such as SQL, Base SAS, R, or Python. A good website for beginners to learn about SQL and Python is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">https://www.w3schools.com</a>.</p>
<p>It is assumed that you have access to a physical or virtual machine provisioned with the CentOS Linux 7 (or Red Hat Linux) operating system.

<p>A basic knowledge of Linux shell commands is required in order to install, configure, and provision a self-contained local development environment hosting the prerequisite software services detailed in <a href="673f253e-c30f-41af-b5e0-e5fd301f829c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Setting Up a Local Development Environment</em>.
