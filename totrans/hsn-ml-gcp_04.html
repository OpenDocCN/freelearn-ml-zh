<p>Technological evolution has, over the last few years,<span> </span><span>led</span><span> to a considerable increase in electronic devices able to automate numerous operations, both in the business world and in families. These devices generate a huge amount of data every day, the volume of which has seen an exponential growth in recent years.</span></p>
<p>This data represents a great resource that, in the past, has not been expressed for too long. Today, large companies are aware that the success of their activities depends at least, if not largely, on the information derived from the processing of such data. But dealing with a large amount of data requires a great deal of effort on the part of companies—both technological and human effort. Google was one of the first companies that understood the importance of data management, and over time it created a technological background that is available to companies and individuals <span>today</span>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will get an introduction to the BigQuery and Data Studio platform to manage and view data. To start, we will take a look at big data and the problems associated with managing large amounts of data. We will then analyze how to organize data and the tools used to correctly query databases. With this in mind, an introduction to the SQL language will be proposed. We will then analyze Google BigQuery, a web service that enables interactive analysis of massively large datasets. Finally, we will analyze how to create reports from our data using Google Data Studio.</p>
<p>The topics covered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big data</li>
<li>Querying databases</li>
<li>SQL language</li>
<li>Google BigQuery</li>
<li>Google Data Studio</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the chapter, the reader will be able to apply these tools to analyze their data without the need for technological support. Several examples will be dealt with to make the use of such tools as realistic as possible in real cases.</p>

<p>The explosion of social networks, combined with the unstoppable spread of smartphones, justifies the fact that one of the recurring terms in the world of innovation, marketing, and information technology<span> in recent years </span>is big data. This term indicates data produced in large quantities, with considerable speed, and in the most diverse formats, the processing of which requires technologies and resources that go well beyond the conventional systems of management and storage of data. But what is enclosed in this term?</p>
<p>In a widely quoted article, <em>The Age of Big Data</em>, Steve Lohr (a technology reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>) explained big data in this way:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">"What is Big Data? A meme and a marketing term, for sure, but also shorthand for advancing trends in technology that open the door to a new approach to understanding the world and making decisions."</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">For a detailed reading of the entire article, refer to the following URL: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html</a>.</div>
<p>The term big data should not mislead us; in fact, at first sight, we may think that this phenomenon concerns only the data size. Although the dimensions certainly represent an element of the problem, there are other aspects or other properties of big data that are not necessarily associated with them.</p>
<p><em>"Big data has three dimensions—volume, variety, and velocity</em>," says <span>Michael </span>Minelli. "<em>And within each of those three dimensions is a wide range of variables</em>."</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the three dimensions associated with big data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Big data implies huge volumes of data. Earlier, it was men who created data. Now that data is generated by machines, networks, and social media, the volume of data to be analyzed is enormous. Yet volume is not the only problem that needs to be addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Variety</strong>: The variety in data is due to the many sources and types of both structured and unstructured data in which such data is stored. In the past, data was stored in spreadsheets and databases. Now it is available in the form of photos, videos, audio, emails, and so on. This variety of unstructured data creates problems for storing, extracting, and analyzing data.</li>
<li><strong>Velocity</strong>: Finally, velocity refers to the sequence in which data arrives from sources such as industrial processes, machines, networks, social media, mobile devices, and so on. The flow of data is therefore massive and continuous. This real-time data can help researchers and companies make important decisions that offer strategic competitive advantages if they are able to manage the speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies are generating ever-increasing amounts of data, capturing trillions of information bytes on their customers, suppliers, and operations. This large amount of information is due to the fact that the data arrives massively from sources such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors that collect different types of data</li>
<li>GPRS packages of mobile phones that map the position of potential customers</li>
<li>Contents on social media</li>
<li>Images—digital and video</li>
<li>Online recordings of purchase transactions</li>
<li>Any other source that can produce information of our interest</li>
</ul>
<p>These are shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8e0587ef-60f2-4af4-a2c1-ce6abedc3c17.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Functionally, gathering this large amount of structured and unstructured data can help organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce costs</li>
<li>Improve operational efficiency and production performance</li>
<li><span>Improve customer relationships</span></li>
<li>Develop new products in a more informed way</li>
<li>Accelerate and synchronize deliveries</li>
<li>Formulate and respond to more in-depth requests</li>
<li>Improve and simplify decision-making</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is already the reality for many large companies. The challenge for the future is to make sure that even small companies as well as individuals can have access to resources that allow them to process data in a simple and functional way.</p>
<p>Thanks to data storage and cloud computing, the ability to memorize, aggregate, and combine data (and therefore to use the results to perform deep analysis) is gradually becoming more accessible. In other words, these services continue to reduce their costs and other technological barriers in the face of an increasingly performant and efficient service. For example, with cloud computing, highly scalable computing resources can be accessed through the internet, often at lower prices than those needed to install on their computers, as resources are shared among many users.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Data structuring</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>Every day, everywhere in the world, large volumes of data are generated by the different activities of man. Originally, these pieces of data are not structured as they come from sources of different natures. They therefore require an organization to be ready for use. Thus, the unstructured information collected must be processed according to specific requirements and subsequently stored as structured data. There are many forms of data structures, ranging from basic to advanced and complex, and their use is essential in the process of structuring data.</span></p>
<p>Data structuring consists of a set of linear or nonlinear operations performed on apparently random and unstructured data taken as input. These operations are intended to analyze the nature of the data and its importance. The system then divides the data into broad categories of information, as measured by the results of the analysis, and stores them or sends them for further analysis. This additional analysis can be used to subdivide the data into additional subcategories of nested categories. During the analysis, some data can also be considered useless and eventually discarded.</p>
<p>The result of this process is represented by structured data, which can be further analyzed or used directly to extract information not known until now. The shift from unstructured data to useful information is what the cycle of structuring and processing data is based on, and their success often determines the importance of data in a given field of application.</p>
<p>Data structuring is a methodology for organizing and archiving data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. In particular, a data structure consists of a collection of data values, in the relationships between them and in the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/aebf9994-917a-4808-a80b-6261fa0507c9.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Over time, data has been organized in different ways, starting from very basic structures like arrays that are commonly used in programming languages, all the way to modern data structures that can take complex forms. Modern data structures are databases of different types that support a wide range of elaborations and extended operations, which allow easy manipulation, categorization, and sorting of data in many different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Relational databases</strong> are the preferred data structure for many people because they have been widely used for many years. The term <strong>database</strong> indicates the set of data used in a specific information system, of a business, scientific, administrative, or some other type. A database consists of two different types of information, belonging to distinct levels of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data, which represents the entities of the system to be modeled. The properties of these entities are described in terms of values (numeric, alphanumeric, and so on). The pieces of data are also grouped or classified into categories based on their common structure (for example, books, authors, and so on).</li>
<li>Structures (metadata), which describe the common characteristics of various categories of data, such as names and types of property values.</li>
</ul>
<p>A database must represent the different aspects of reality, and, in particular, in addition to the actual data, also the relationships between the data, that is, the logical connections among the various categories. For example, the association that binds each author to their books and vice versa must be represented. The database must also meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must be organized with minimal redundancy, that is, not be unnecessarily duplicated. This condition derives from the need to avoid not only the unnecessary use of storage resources, but also and above all the burden of managing multiple copies; furthermore, if the information relating to a category of data is duplicated, there is a risk that an update carried out on one of the copies and not shown on the others has negative consequences on the consistency and reliability of all data.</li>
<li>Data must be usable at the same time by multiple users. This requirement derives from the previous point; the situation in which each user (or category of users) works on his own copy of the data is to be avoided, and there must be a single version of the data, to which all users can access; this implies the need for each type of user to have a specific view of the data and specific access rights to the data. Furthermore, techniques are necessary to prevent the activity of the various users from creating conflicts for the simultaneous use of the same data.</li>
<li>Data must be permanent. This implies not only the use of mass memories, but also the application of techniques that preserve the set of data in case of malfunction of any component of the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table is the fundamental data structure of a relational database. The tables represent the entities and relationships of the conceptual schema. It consists of records (rows or tuples) and fields (columns or attributes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Each record represents an instance (or occurrence or tuple) of the entity/relationship</li>
<li>Each field represents an attribute of the entity/relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>For each field a domain is identified (datatype): alphanumeric, numeric, date, Boolean, and so on.</p>
<p>The set of fields whose values uniquely identify a record within a table is called a <strong>primary key</strong>. When the primary key consists of only one field, it is called a <strong>key field</strong>. The following diagram shows an example of a primary key in a database:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/33f32066-23ad-4fc7-b2ab-4e6002b12406.png" style=""/></div>
<p>When a key field cannot be found between the attributes of an entity, a numeric ID field is defined that auto-increments (counter).</p>
<p>Referential integrity is a set of rules of the relational model that guarantees data integrity when relationships are associated with one another through the foreign key: these rules are used to validate associations between tables and to eliminate errors in inserting, deleting, or modifying linked data.</p>
<p>The index is relevant in a database. An index is a data structure designed to improve data search times. Fields in a table for which searches or join operations are required can be indexed. In the absence of an index, the search for the value of a field takes place sequentially on the records in the table. Indexes are automatically generated from the database for fields defined as keys.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>So far we have seen how to move from unstructured information to structured information. In particular, we have learned that this operation requires a lot of resources. The need for properly structured data derives from the need to search for information in a database to extract knowledge.</p>
<p>Any <strong>Database management system</strong> (<strong>DBMS</strong>) provides a very powerful tool for consulting the contents of database tables: queries.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>A DBMS, is a software system designed to allow the creation, manipulation (by a DBA administrator) and the efficient query (by one or more client users) of databases, so also called a <strong>database manager</strong> or an <strong>engine</strong>, and hosted on a dedicated hardware architecture (server) or on a simple computer.</p>
</div>
<p>A query is a method for querying the database, that is, to display information extracted from the tables. For this purpose it is possible to perform several operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter the data contained in a table according to various criteria</li>
<li>Reassociate data contained in different tables</li>
<li>Choose which fields to view</li>
<li>Sort the result based on the values of some fields</li>
<li>Group (aggregate) records that have the same values in a certain field</li>
</ul>
<p>Queries can be executed to display the result only once, or they can be saved in the database to be executed several times. If you use a query again after changing the table, the query result returns the new table contents.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that you have a library database containing two tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Books table, represents the books in the catalog and contains the fields <kbd>ID_Book</kbd> (primary key), Title, Author, Year, Price, Publisher</li>
<li>The Publisher table, represents the publishing houses with which the library has contacts and includes the fields Publishing House (primary key), City, Telephone</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of wanting to define a query that shows the title and price of all books. This query will need to access the Books table and present the user with only the two fields chosen (Title and Price). In case the Books table contains 80 volumes, the query will display 80 Title and Price pairs in the result. If one of the records were deleted from the Books table, rerunning the already-defined query would result in only 79 Title and Price pairs, without having to intervene on the definition of the query.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>At this point it is legitimate to ask the following question: <em>which language to use to formulate queries to a database?</em> We need a query language that is a language used to create queries on databases and information systems by users. It is used to make it possible to extract information from the database, through the relevant DBMS, querying the database, and then interfacing with the user and their service requests. The universally used query language is SQL.</p>
<p>SQL is a language for defining and manipulating data. As a manipulation language, SQL allows to select data of interest from the base and to update its content. The queries are used both in the SQL constructs of data definition and in those of updating the database.</p>
<p>SQL is a declarative language: it allows you to specify what to look for without saying how. When a query is executed by the query processor, it is translated into a procedural language inside the system which allows specifying how to access the data. There are generally several translations of a SQL query into the procedural language. The task of the query optimizer is to choose the most efficient execution plan.</p>
<p>A SQL query is performed on a database, then on a set of tables connected to one another by the mechanism of foreign keys. The result of a query is a table. We will introduce SQL by example, that is, showing increasingly rich and complex examples of interrogation.</p>
<p>To understand how SQL works, we analyze the table containing the number of visitors to Italian museums in the two years, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/725e0fec-6d0f-41ae-b9d1-5de4b857eda9.png"/></div>
<p>This table in named <strong>Museum</strong>; the simplest interrogation that can be written is the following:</p>
<pre>select *<br/>from museum</pre>
<p>The result is the entire museum table. The first line of the query is called <kbd>select</kbd> statement and is used to retrieves data from a database. The <kbd>*</kbd> operator allows us to select all columns. The second line of the query is called <kbd>from</kbd> statement and serves to indicate which tables to use. The <kbd>select</kbd> statement and that from are mandatory in a query. Pay close attention to the case, spacing, and logical separation of the components of each query by SQL keywords.</p>
<p> If we are interested only in the name and in the city of museums, we can select them in this way:</p>
<pre>select Museum, City<br/>from museum</pre>
<p>The result is the following table:</p>
<div>
<table>

<p><strong>Museum</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>To clarify the difference between database tables and SQL tables, we see a simple query that generates a table with two columns with the same name:</p>
<pre>select Museum, Museum<br/>from museum</pre>
<p>The result is the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>

<td>
<p><strong>Museum</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>A SQL table can contain duplicate rows and columns of the same name. The columns are uniquely identified by their position. This is true for the tables resulting from the queries. The database tables, that is, those that are part of the database, cannot have columns of the same name.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we show a simple query that generates a table with equal rows:</p>
<pre>select city<br/>from museum</pre>
<p>The result is the following table:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>  City</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>ROMA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>POMPEI</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p>FIRENZE</p>
</td>

<tr>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>CASERTA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>ROMA</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Also, you can specify the <kbd>distinct</kbd> keyword after the <kbd>select</kbd> keyword to eliminate duplicates:</p>
<pre>select distinct city<br/>from museum</pre>
<p><span>The result is the following table:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>  City</strong></p>
</td>

<p>ROMA</p>

<p>VENARIA R.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>TORINO</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>CASERTA</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now let's introduce the <kbd>where</kbd> clause:</p>
<pre>select Museum,City<br/>from museum<br/>where City = 'Rome'</pre>
<p>The result is the following table:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Museum</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>  City</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Colosseo e Foro Romano</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>ROMA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Castel Sant'Angelo</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>ROMA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Galleria Borghese</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>ROMA</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>If you ever want to find a particular item or group of items in your database, you need one or more conditions. Conditions are contained in the <kbd>where</kbd> clause. For example, to find museums that in 2016 registered a number of visitors over one million, we will have to write:</p>
<pre>select Museum, City, Visitors_2016<br/>from museum<br/>where Visitors_2016 &gt;= 1000000</pre>
<p>The result is the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Museum</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>  City</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Visitors_2016</strong></p>

<p>Data represents a fundamental factor for the management and growth of companies. Ensuring that data is protected, available and easily accessible is a fundamental requirement of any IT department. More importantly, another requirement is to ensure that data is used in the correct way: to manage processes, to inform decision makers, and to intervene intelligently in changing circumstances.</p>
<p>The way companies ensure data availability is rapidly changing. Cloud computing has seen impressive growth in recent years, both as a concept and as a practical component of the IT infrastructure.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Cloud computing is a technology that allows the use, via remote server, of software and hardware resources (such as mass storage for data storage), whose use is offered as a service by a provider, specifically by subscription.</p>
</div>
<p>A particularly interesting Cloud computing solution is Google BigQuery. BigQuery, is a web service designed to allow you to perform queries on large datasets; for example, it is able to perform selection and aggregation queries on tables with billions of records in a few seconds, so it would be a good step forward to obtain in an interactive way information that previously took days to be calculated.</p>
<p>BigQuery enables companies and developers around the world to manage large amounts of data in real time, without the support of any hardware or software investment. The service provided by Google is useful if, for example, a large multinational company has to optimize its daily spending based on sales and advertising data, but even if a small online retailer has to change the presentation of a product based on the user clicks. The system, as stated by the producers themselves, also aims to help many companies fight the prevailing world economic crisis.</p>
<p>By making BigQuery a public service, Google claims to have reached an important milestone in the effort to make Big data analytics accessible to all businesses through the Cloud service. BigQuery is accessible through a simple user interface that allows you to take advantage of the power of calculation offered by Google. The collected data is protected on multiple levels of security, replicated in multiple servers and can be easily exported. Developers and businesses can subscribe online to the service and take advantage of 100 GB of data per month for free.</p>
<p>The main features of BigQuery are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: One of the inherent advantages of Cloud computing is the ability to expand the infrastructure on demand, ensuring a dynamic scalability of application capacity based on the increase in needs. This is particularly useful when the peak usage level of hosted applications changes consistently with the passage of time.</li>
<li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Manages to perform selection or group queries on billions of records in a matter of seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Familiarity</strong>: Uses an SQL dialect for writing queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also allows a good sharing of data, the use of Google Storage allows you to create a collaboration hub. Whenever the need arises to share their data with other users it is possible to give access to the information available to those who want to appropriately by setting up the <strong>access control list</strong> (<strong><span>ACL</span></strong>).</p>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>An ACL is a mechanism used to express complex rules that determine whether some of the IT system's resources are accessed by its users.</p>
</div>
<p>BigQuery contains methods that allow both to create, populate, and delete tables, and to query above them. Writing queries in BigQuery is possible using a SQL dialect; in this dialect, some SQL methods have been modified to speed up the execution of some queries; in those cases, where the precision of the results is not essential, they are based on statistical estimates and return an indicative value.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>BigQuery is the data warehouse of Google Analytics. It is basically a fully managed, petabyte and low-cost tool. BigQuery is NoOps: the term <strong>NoOps</strong> (short for <strong>no operation</strong>) identifies an IT environment so automated and abstracted from the underlying infrastructure that does not require a dedicated team to manage the software internally. In fact, in BigQuery there is no infrastructure to manage and a database administrator is not required. The time saved can be used to analyze data in order to find meaningful information. To form queries in BigQuery we can use a familiar SQL syntax, very simple to learn, and extremely effective. But the real convenience in using this technology comes from the actual savings due to the pay-as-you-go model that allows us to pay only for the actual use of the resources needed to perform a specific analysis.</p>
<p>To access BigQuery we can essentially use three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a graphical web UI</li>
<li>Using a command-line tool</li>
<li>Using API or client libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will only analyze the operation of BigQuery through a graphical interface.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>BigQuery can be accessed through a web graphical user interface that can be used to load and export data, perform queries, and perform other user and management tasks in the browser. The web user interface can be run in any browser, even if Google recommends using Chrome web browser as it produces maximum performance.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">To access BigQuery via web UI, go to the following link:<br/>
<a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com">https://bigquery.cloud.google.com</a></div>
<p>Once you have logged in, you will see the BigQuery console as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d641a327-ad27-462d-8afa-1e4b170fe86f.png" style=""/></div>
<p>In the BigQuery console a welcome message is displayed. In it, various activities are proposed to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <span class="packt_screen">BigQuery Quickstart guide</span></li>
<li>Run a query—on sample data already available to practice—by clicking <span class="packt_screen">"Compose Query"</span></li>
<li>Create a new dataset and load data into a table using the menu on the left</li>
<li>Discover the <span class="packt_screen">cost control options in BigQuery</span></li>
<li>Finally, refer to the BigQuery web user interface guide for more information about the user interface</li>
</ul>
<p>To analyze in detail the BigQuery console, we will choose the second option, then click on the <span class="packt_screen">COMPOSE QUERY</span> button at the top left. In this way, the window shown in the following screenshot is displayed:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d130988f-4d11-4054-8fcf-5b629d235ed6.png" style=""/></div>
<p>In the previous screenshot two main sections are highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Navigation bar</strong>: Starting from the top, it contains a list of elements that describes what action you want to perform: compose a query, consult the query history, or consult the job history. Continuing down, we can identify a list of datasets in the current project that has read access, plus a public dataset called <strong>public data</strong>. This list shows a series of public databases made available to us for practicing. To be able to use this data, just click on the icon of the dataset expansion next to any dataset or the name of the dataset, so the link will be extended and we will be able to view the tables within that dataset.</li>
<li><strong>Query box</strong>: Represents a box where you can type a query in the SQL syntax. This is the main part of the window as it represents the place where we formulate our queries. As anticipated in order to formulate a query it is necessary to use the SQL syntax that we have at least partly seen in the previous sections. Of course, in the examples that we will propose we will have the opportunity to deepen the topic. After correctly formulating the query to execute it, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Run Query</span> button at the bottom of the query box.</li>
<li><strong>Dataset details</strong>: Represents the section that contains a summary of the data we have selected in the navigation bar. The name of the dataset, a brief description of its content, a series of details, and finally the tables contained in the dataset are proposed. To get a preview of the contents of a single table, simply click on the table name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take an example to understand the ease of use of the BigQuery console. We use one of the public datasets available:</p>
<p><kbd>bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015</kbd>.</p>
<p>This dataset is collected by the NYC <strong>Taxi and Limousine Commission</strong> (<strong>TLC</strong>) and includes trip records from all trips completed by yellow and green taxis in New York City from 2009 to present, and all trips in <strong>for-hire vehicles</strong> (<strong>FHV</strong>) from 2015 to present. Records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.</p>
<p>In the following table are listed the several fields contained in the dataset with a brief description of the content:</p>

<p>To start, let's formulate a simple query to the database. <em>How many trips did Yellow taxis take each month in 2015?</em> This query must return monthly trip totals for all Yellow taxis in 2015. Someone may think that we are starting with operations that are too simple; in fact, it seems trivial to count the taxi calls made each month. This is true for most small cities but not for a metropolis like New York. In fact, we are talking about a database of dimensions equal to 18.1 GB and with a number of observations equal to 146,112,989.</p>
<p>Let's see then the SQL code to insert into the query box:</p>
<pre>#standardSQL<br/>SELECT<br/> TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(pickup_datetime,<br/>    MONTH) month,<br/>  COUNT(*) trips<br/>FROM<br/>  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`<br/>GROUP BY<br/>  1<br/>ORDER BY<br/>  1</pre>
<p>Let's explain it line by line to understand the meaning of each command used. Let's start from the first line:</p>
<pre>#standardSQL</pre>
<p>The first line is inserted to let BigQuery know you want to use SQL standard. We can enable standard SQL for a query, so you do not have to insert this tag into your SQL. To do so, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Show Options</span> button located immediately below the query box. In the section that opens uncheck the <span class="packt_screen">Use Legacy SQL</span> checkbox. Let's move forward in the analysis of the query:</p>
<pre>SELECT<br/> TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(pickup_datetime, MONTH) month,<br/>  COUNT(*) trips</pre>
<p>In this piece of code we use the <kbd>SELECT</kbd> statement, which as already anticipated in the previous sections, retrieves data from a database. In the first part of the statement, you specify which data to retrieve. We have said that the number of trips for each month is in us. To do this we will count the number of lines for each month. Recall that each line in the database corresponds to a trip. The field containing this information is <kbd>pickup_datetime</kbd>. To return the data in an easily readable format, we used the <kbd>TIMESTAMP_TRUNC</kbd> function which truncates to <kbd>TIMESTAMP</kbd> value (the return value is of type <kbd>TIMESTAMP</kbd>). Then, we use the <kbd>count()</kbd> function that returns the number of rows that match a specified criteria. Let's move forward:</p>
<pre>FROM<br/>  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`</pre>
<p>With the <kbd>FROM</kbd> clause, we select the table in which to search. Finally the last two lines:</p>
<pre>GROUP BY<br/>  1<br/>ORDER BY<br/>  1</pre>
<p>These lines have been inserted to group and sort the data. The results are shown in the following table:</p>
<table>

<p>As you can see, the number of trips in each month ranges from a minimum of 11,130,304 to a maximum of 13,351,609. The following screenshot shows the results in the BigQuery console:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d61dd6e3-1bad-44a9-8e51-029485be8d74.png" style=""/></div>
<p>In the previous screenshot two details are highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>A report on calculation times and data processed</li>
<li>A series of results storage options</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, BigQuery tells us that to complete the operation, the Google resources have been committed to 4.5 s, and that 1.09 GB of data was processed during this time. This information will be useful for calculating the cost of the transaction.</p>
<p>In the previous image we highlighted the available storage options. Four options are offered to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download as CSV</li>
<li>Download as JSON</li>
<li>Save as table</li>
<li>Save to Google Sheets</li>
</ul>
<p>If you recall, the JSON syntax is a subset of the JavaScript syntax, while Google Sheets is an online spreadsheet app that lets users create and format spreadsheets and simultaneously work with other people.</p>
<p>In the previous screenshot, it is possible to notice that at the top of the results there are two tabs: <span class="packt_screen">Results</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Details</span>. So far, we have seen what is returned in the <span class="packt_screen">Results</span> tab; let's see what we see if we click on the <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> tab instead. A series of statistics on the operation performed are returned to us, as shown in the following:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Google Data Studio is a <strong>FREE</strong> tool that allows us to create captivating reports quickly and easily. We can finally say goodbye to redundant and confusing data sheets. With Data Studio, in fact, besides being able to insert simple tables, it is possible to attach customizable graphics with various colors and fonts that will be easily understandable. With Google Data Studio, sharing reports is even easier as it is a Google Drive application and works similarly.</p>
<p>The most important news for companies (but also, if not above all, for customers) lies in the extremely intuitive interface. To keep everything under control, moreover, Google gives the possibility to change the date range (at the report or chart level).</p>
<p>In a few clicks, in fact, you can realize the progress of the site almost in real time. Data Studio is useful for two types of users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who creates the reports</strong>: Analysis and marketing employees</li>
<li><strong>Who will read the reports</strong>: Customers and CEOs of companies</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Data Studio, currently available in beta, allows you to create dynamic reports and dashboards with a strong visual impact.  With Data Studio it is possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily connect to different data sources</li>
<li>View your data with dynamic, interactive, and eye-catching reports and dashboards</li>
<li>Share and collaborate with others, following the logic in use on Google Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>To view a report with Data Studio, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need is a web browser (the ones tested are: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).</li>
<li>You do not need a Google account.</li>
</ul>
<p>While to create reports and data sources, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be logged in to a Google account</li>
<li>You need to be in one of the supported countries (in other words, all countries bar these: the People's Republic of China, Russia, Svalbard Islands and Jan Mayen, Iran, Iraq, Crimea, North Korea, Syria, Cuba)</li>
<li><span>You need to b</span>e able to use Google Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>Data sources use pipelines to secure datasets called <strong>connectors</strong>. When Data Studio first connects to a specific type of dataset, such as Google Analytics or AdWords, you are asked for permission to connect, which can be removed at any time. At this point, to connect to a certain type of dataset, for example, for Google Analytics, you can connect to only one account, one property and one view; for AdWords, you connect to an administrator or standard account; for BigQuery, you provide a project and a table or a custom query, and so on.</p>

<p>To start, let's see what are the first steps to be done to immediately create a report in Data Studio. To be able to use Data Studio, it is not necessary to fill in any registration form; you just need to have an active Google account. If you've already signed into your Google Account, just type the following URL in a browser: <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" target="_blank">https://datastudio.google.com/</a>.<a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" target="_blank"/></p>
<p>This will take you directly to the Data Studio home page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/373caf0d-c853-4cf3-af32-7c4604c24fd1.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Once you have viewed the main page of Data Studio we can identify some sections that will help us to create our reports (in the previous screenshot they are highlighted). To start getting comfortable with the Data Studio interface we can consult some built-in templates to start already available. You can choose an existing model and modify it or simply start with a new blank report.</p>
<p>Clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">All models</span> drop-down menu displays all the built-in templates. In this way we can choose any model that matches our needs and modify it using the available editor, in order to adapt it to our needs. Predefined templates are useful to get started or for those who have little time to spend on formatting settings. In fact, in these models the functionalities are already ready for use, thus saving a lot of time.</p>
<p>To understand effectively how to use Data Studio we will start from an empty report, in order to explain all the steps necessary to create a report. There are two ways to start with a new report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the empty plus (+) page on the horizontal header (blank)</li>
<li>Click on the (+) icon in the lower right corner</li>
</ul>
<p>Both options are clearly highlighted in the previous figure, and in both cases the window that shows in the following screen is displayed:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/360df404-979e-41a1-b9c3-341afa6e892b.png" style=""/></div>
<p>This displays the report editor with all the controls and elements needed to add charts and data, and to choose the style of your report. Initially, the new report has a default name (<kbd>Untitled Report</kbd>) at the top left of the screen, so just click on it and we will enter a new name for the report (<kbd>First Report</kbd>).</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to add a data source to the report. To do this we have two options again:</p>
<ul>
<li>An existing data source</li>
<li>Create new data source</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous screenshot, the two areas in which the options can be activated are highlighted. It is possible to notice that data sources proposed by exercise are already available at the bottom of the data source selector. On this occasion, we will refer to these resources. For example, to select the first item that refers to <kbd>[Sample] World Population Data 2005-2014</kbd>, just click on it. This dataset contains the world population data from 2005 to 2014. In this case the window shown in the following screenshot will be displayed:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b939a5f7-faf5-446b-9b78-a2b5b1baa803.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">ADD TO REPORT</span> button, the main window of Data Studio is enriched with new components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menu Bar</strong>: This allows you to access many other menu functions by right-clicking on a component.</li>
<li><strong>Toolbar</strong>: This allows you to choose among various tools, pages, and control options. This toolbar is divided into five sections.</li>
<li><strong>Layout and Theme properties panel</strong>: We can control the way your report appears on the viewer's screen using the options in this panel. This is the default properties panel; it appears when no other component is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the new aspect of the Report Figure:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fba3d30e-2d6e-47c1-8c76-d04443f35364.png" style=""/></div>
<p>To add a chart to the page in our empty report, just click on one of the icons in the toolbar. For example, to add a bar chart of the world population from 2005 until 2014 will suffice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the second icon in the third area of the toolbar (Bar chart)</li>
<li>Position the viewfinder at the point on the page where you want the graph to be shown</li>
<li>Draw the graph under the title, to move it just click and drag it, or select it, and use the arrow keys on the keyboard</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is done, the bar chart of our data will appear in the main area and the <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Theme</span> properties panel on the right will give way to the bar chart properties panel, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0d3d2111-0e66-4b6e-b007-45c4c2d37d3a.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The bar chart properties panel becomes essential to make changes to the chart just added to our report. We can in fact change the type of chart, change the data source, add another dimension, add a new metric, and change the sorting of the data.</p>
<p>Data Studio does not allow the entire dashboard or multiple reports in a <kbd>.pdf</kbd> or other format. Although it is possible to export a single table or chart in a CSV format. To export a chart or a table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">View</span> tab at the top right to view the reports in view mode</li>
<li>Hover over the graph or report you want to export</li>
<li>Right click and select <span class="packt_screen">Export CSV</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To export a whole dashboard as a PDF, there is not any internal functionality added yet that will help you export reports as <kbd>.pdf</kbd>. But by using a chrome extension you can do this very easily (Google Data Studio PDF Export). An alternative way of exporting a report to PDF is to print to PDF via your browser. You would have to do that for each report page.</p>

<p>In this chapter, an introduction of the BigQuery and Data Studio platform to manage and view data are proposed. To start, we explored the big data and the problems associated with managing large amounts of data. Then we analyzed how to organize data in a structured format to correctly query databases.</p>
<p>After this, you were introduced to SQL. SQL is a language for defining and manipulating data. As a manipulation language, SQL allows to select data of interest from the base and to update its content. The queries are used both in the SQL constructs of data definition and in those of updating the database.</p>
<p>Then a Google BigQuery introduction was performed. BigQuery is a web service that enables interactive analysis of massively large datasets. BigQuery enables companies and developers around the world to manage large amounts of data in real time, without the support of any hardware or software investment.</p>
<p>Finally, we have analyzed how to create reports from our data using Google Data Studio. Google Data Studio is a FREE tool that allows us to create captivating reports quickly and easily. With Data Studio, besides being able to insert simple tables, it is possible to attach customizable graphics with various colors and fonts that will be easily understandable.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will we present Dataprep a services useful to pre-process the data, extract features and clean up the records, and Dataflow a service to implement streaming and batch processing.</p>
