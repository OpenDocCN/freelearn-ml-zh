<p><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“I know you, you were working with Elías Combarro when he gave that</span></em> <em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">course about quantum computing at CERN. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That course changed my</span></em> <em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">life!”</span></em></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As I welcome students and more seasoned researchers to the CERN IT Department, it is not unusual to hear this kind of comment about Elías’ lectures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I’ve been working at CERN for 25 years on R&amp;D projects in computing and data science for high-energy physics and still I have not seen this happening that often with other courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When I started building the CERN Quantum Technology Initiative in 2018, quantum computing and its applications had already started growing at an accelerated pace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were looking for ways of understanding the potential benefits for physics and contributing to the ongoing research in theory, computing, sensing, and communication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A daunting task despite the incredible work that CERN has been doing since 1954 in physics and computing for physics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where to start? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to build knowledge? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to identify and address realistic problems? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Which tools and techniques should we focus on?</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prof. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combarro joined CERN in 2020 for a short sabbatical, and he immediately became a reference for the team, inspiring students and researchers and helping us lay solid foundations for the work we were doing with the LHC experiments and the theory groups at CERN. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samuel González-Castillo joined the team a year later during his summer internship, building from the ground up our first prototype of a quantum systems benchmark framework.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This book is the perfect image of how I saw them in action. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It will initially guide you across complex concepts with rare clarity, building solid foundations to work comfortably with quantum optimization methods, quantum machine learning, and hybrid architectures without ever losing sight of the goal of providing a realistic, practical, usable approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chapters 1 and 2 will introduce you to the basics of quantum computing, building a reference of mathematical concepts and notations and a first practical overview of the ”tools of the trade,” the frameworks and platforms used to interact with quantum devices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the foundations are set like a sort of teaser of what’s to come, the rest of the book guides you through two complementary paths, quantum optimization methods in Chapters 3 to 7, and quantum machine learning, quantum neural networks, and hybrid architectures in Chapters 8 to 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The authors not only provide clear formal explanations at every step, but also practical instructions and examples on how to implement and execute algorithms and methods on freely accessible actual quantum computers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exercises (with detailed answers) are given throughout the book to check the progress of the exploration and gently nudge you beyond your comfort zone, always keeping the interest alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether you are at the beginning of your discovery of quantum computing or are looking to understand its potential in your ongoing research, this book will be a trustworthy guide on an exciting journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And I’m sure that the next time I meet you, you will say </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“I know you, you wrote the foreword for Elias’ and</span></em> <em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samuel’s book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That book changed my life!”</span></em></p>
