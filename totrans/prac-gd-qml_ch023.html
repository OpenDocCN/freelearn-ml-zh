— Alexander Hamilton</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This has been a long and (hopefully) interesting journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 12 chapters of this book, we’ve covered a lot of topics on quantum computing, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, so maybe it’s time to take a look back and see what we have learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We started by laying the foundations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied the most important mathematical concepts underlying the theory of quantum computing, including how information is stored on qubits, how we can transform their states with quantum gates, and how we can obtain results by measuring them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we explored some of the software tools currently available to implement quantum algorithms, with a special emphasis on the two main software libraries used in this book: Qiskit and PennyLane. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We learned how to implement quantum circuits with both frameworks and how to run them on simulators and on actual quantum hardware.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we began to uncover how quantum algorithms can be used to solve optimization problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To that end, we studied different ways of formulating combinatorial optimization problems as the search for ground states of certain Hamiltonians. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is how we got to know the QUBO and Ising formalisms, that we later used with different types of quantum computers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we used quantum annealers, with their heuristic implementation of adiabatic quantum computing, and we learned different ways of solving optimization problems with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we turned to gate-based quantum computers, and studied the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Grover’s Adaptive Search.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After that, we widened the scope of our optimization tasks and studied situations in which our interest was set on finding ground states of observables related to problems in different fields, including chemistry and physics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this case, our focus was on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time that we studied its mathematical definition and its practical implementation, we also learned about noisy simulations and readout error mitigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we changed gears and started studying the application of quantum computing in machine learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first briefly reviewed </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">classical</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> machine learning and explained what makes quantum machine learning different. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we started studying several quantum machine learning model architectures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first was that of Quantum Support Vector Machines, which we derived from classical SVMs by introducing quantum kernels.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After that, we focused our attention on how to implement a quantum analog of neural networks that are called — not very imaginatively, we concede — quantum neural networks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this, we used parametrized circuits in two different ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, using the free parameters of a part of the circuit to embed classical data into the space of quantum states (as we had already done with QSVMs)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, using the rest of the values as trainable parameters to minimize a cost function</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We learned of different ways of computing the gradients needed for the training and we implemented some examples in both PennyLane and Qiskit.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, we decided to play a little bit with our new, shiny quantum neural networks and we mixed them with classical neural networks to form hybrid neural networks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also learned a thing or two about hyperparameter optimization with Optuna and about building and training classical and hybrid networks with PyTorch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All this hard work paid off soon, because it allowed us to implement a very interesting model architecture: that of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We learned a little bit about the theory behind them and we showed how to implement and train a couple of simple examples to learn quantum states and probability distributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the methods that we have studied are what we may call modern quantum algorithms: they have been proposed in the last 10 years or so, mainly with current, noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers in mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And they are the subject of intense development and study by the quantum computing community as we are writing these lines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You may very well say that, with this book, you now know a good deal about what the </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">present</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> of quantum computing looks like.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But this should be just the dawn of quantum computing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As wonderful as the ideas behind the methods and devices that we have studied may be (and they truly are!), they still have some limitations (that sometimes are painfully obvious). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the reduced scale and resilience to the noise of current quantum computers and due to our incomplete understanding of the capabilities of modern quantum algorithms such as QAOA, VQE, or the different flavors of quantum neural networks, it is difficult to demonstrate quantum computational advantage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, in the cases in which this has been achieved (the most famous one being the quantum supremacy experiment developed by Google researchers </span><span class="cite"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[</span><a href="ch030.xhtml#Xarute2019quantum"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">]</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">), the problems are mainly academic and of little practical application.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Does this mean that we are pessimistic about the future of quantum computing? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the contrary! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is still much work to do, but we think that we are experiencing the beginning of what could very well be a revolution in the way we compute and process information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The famous science fiction writer Arthur C. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clarke formulated three adages that are </span><span id="dx1-224001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">popularly known as </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clarke’s</span></strong> <strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">laws</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They go as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><div id="x1-224003x1">
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.</span></p>
</div></li>
<li><div id="x1-224005x2">
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</span></p>
</div></li>
<li><div id="x1-224007x3">
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</span></p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Funnily enough, the three of them could be applied to the field of quantum computing — and, probably, the third is the one that most often has been quoted when talking about quantum computers! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But we are especially interested in the second one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We need to keep on investigating, further pushing the frontiers of our knowledge, and exploring new techniques for processing information with quantum devices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To that end, in the next few years, we expect to see developments on different fronts.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, we expect to see the introduction of more capable and reliable quantum computers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, while we were writing this book, IBM announced Osprey, a quantum processor with 433 qubits </span><span class="cite"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[</span><a href="ch030.xhtml#Xibm2022osprey"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">]</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But that is not all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They plan to introduce quantum computers with thousands of qubits in the next few years and other big companies such as Google and Honeywell have similar roadmaps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Size is not the only thing that matters, though, and a lot of effort is being put into decreasing gate and readout errors and in increasing coherence times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This will be crucial to reach the ultimate goal of having fault-tolerant, scalable quantum computers.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thanks to these new, improved quantum computers, we expect to see new demonstrations of quantum advantage: practical experiments in which a quantum computer solves a task much faster than what is possible with the most powerful classical supercomputer available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Probably, the concrete problems tackled in these demonstrations will be not very useful from a practical point of view. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, we think that pursuing these advantages is still very relevant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The more diverse the range of techniques used to achieve quantum supremacy, the better for the field of quantum computing.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But, as you know, this book is mainly about quantum algorithms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So, the developments that we are most excited to see are those related to the development of new quantum methods, the increase of the applicability of quantum techniques, and the deepening of our understanding of the properties of quantum algorithms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, as we have tried to convey throughout this book, this is a field of intense study. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To name just a couple of recent highlights, in the last few months, we have witnessed a new quantum exponential speedup </span><span class="cite"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[</span><a href="ch030.xhtml#Xyamakawa2022verifiable"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">99</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">]</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> and the proof that quantum neural networks may need much less data than their classical counterparts in certain situations </span><span class="cite"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[</span><a href="ch030.xhtml#Xqnn-lowdata"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">112</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">]</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Developing new quantum algorithms, finding new applications of existing quantum techniques, or mathematically proving quantum advantage are, by no means, easy tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But we are confident that, as more and more people learn about quantum computing and as more and more quantum computers become available to run experiments, our knowledge and understanding of the power of quantum algorithms will only grow bigger. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And with that, new, exciting, and powerful applications will eventually become a reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is why we wrote this book: to invite you on this exciting and wonderful journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A journey that is just beginning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A journey into the future of quantum computing.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hope you stay for the ride. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And do not throw away your (quantum) shots! </span><span id="x1-224008r320"/></p>
