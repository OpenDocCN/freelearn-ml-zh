<h1 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Real data and its problems</h1>
<p>In the first part of<a id="_idIndexMarker686"/> this book, we learned why ML models<a id="_idIndexMarker687"/> require large-scale annotated data (<a href="B18494_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>). Then, we delved into the main issues with real data, and we thoroughly analyzed the key drawbacks of the annotation process (<a href="B18494_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>). After that, we discussed and learned why privacy hinders ML progress in certain domains, such as finance and healthcare (<a href="B18494_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Synthetic data as a solution</h1>
<p>Then, we introduced synthetic data as a solution<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> to these complex issues and problems (<em class="italic">Chapters 4</em> and <em class="italic">5</em>). Following this, we explored various well-known approaches to generating synthetic data (<em class="italic">Part 3</em>). We delved into utilizing simulators and game engines to generate synthetic data (<a href="B18494_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>). Then, we explored GANs in detail (<a href="B18494_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>). Later, in our exploration of a novel synthetic data generation approach, we uncovered valuable insights about utilizing video games as a source of synthetic data (<a href="B18494_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>). Finally, we extensively studied diffusion models and explored their diverse applications<a id="_idIndexMarker689"/> for synthetic data generation (<a href="B18494_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Real-world case studies</h1>
<p>We discussed and presented<a id="_idIndexMarker690"/> the effectiveness of utilizing synthetic data in real-life scenarios, by providing diverse real-world examples of the successful utilization of synthetic data in computer vision (<a href="B18494_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>), natural language processing (<a href="B18494_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor188"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>), and predictive analytics (<a href="B18494_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>). Then, we learned about some well-known domain-specific issues that limit the usability of synthetic data and uncovered some best practices to effectively utilize synthetic data in practice (<a href="B18494_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Challenges and limitations</h1>
<p>To ensure that you<a id="_idIndexMarker691"/> are aware of common issues that usually hinder the effective utilization<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> of synthetic data, we comprehensively explored synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approaches. We thoroughly studied the domain gap problem in ML and learned about the main approaches for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation (<a href="B18494_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor230"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>). Then, we learned why diverse data is essential in ML and discovered the main strategies to generate diverse synthetic datasets. Following this, we highlighted the main issues and challenges of generating diverse synthetic data (<a href="B18494_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor247"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a>). After that, we learned why generating photorealistic data is pivotal in computer vision. We also learned about the main approaches to enhancing photorealism and discussed the essential photorealism evaluation metrics. Then, we covered the challenges and limitations of generating photorealistic synthetic data in practice (<a href="B18494_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor269"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>Future perspectives</h1>
<p>We have explored<a id="_idIndexMarker693"/> together the potential of synthetic data. It is now your turn to unlock new opportunities and possibilities in the field of ML. I highly encourage you to join synthetic data communities, such as the Mostly AI synthetic data<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> community on Discord (<a href="https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-discord-community">https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-discord-community</a>) and the Open Community<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> for the Creation and Use of Synthetic Data in AI (<a href="https://opensynthetics.com">https://opensynthetics.com</a>). You can always explore synthetic<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> data generation<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> tools, such<a id="_idIndexMarker698"/> as Synthesized (<a href="https://www.synthesized.io">https://www.synthesized.io</a>), Gretel.ai (<a href="https://gretel.ai">https://gretel.ai</a>) and <span class="No-Break">Neurolabs (</span><a href="https://www.neurolabs.ai"><span class="No-Break">https://www.neurolabs.ai</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<p>In the future, synthetic data is expected to be more diverse, more realistic, cheaper, and easier to generate and utilize. Governments and decision-makers are aware of the huge advantages<a id="_idIndexMarker699"/> of synthetic data. Many governments, including the American<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> government, have a clear plan to advance <strong class="bold">Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing and Analytics</strong> (<strong class="bold">PPDSA</strong>) methods (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf</a>). As expected, synthetic data is central to these solutions. Thus, even more research, attention, and funding<a id="_idIndexMarker701"/> will be given to synthetic data in the <span class="No-Break">near future.</span></p>
