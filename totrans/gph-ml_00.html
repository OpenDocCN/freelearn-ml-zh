			<p>Graph Machine Learning provides a new set of tools for processing network data and leveraging the power of the relationship between entities that can be used for predictive, modeling, and analytics tasks. </p>
			<p>You will start with a brief introduction to graph theory and Graph Machine Learning, learning to understand their potential. As you proceed, you will become well versed with the main machine learning models for graph representation learning: their purpose, how they work, and how they can be implemented in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. You'll then build a complete machine learning pipeline, including data processing, model training, and prediction, in order to exploit the full potential of graph data. Moving on, you will cover real-world scenarios, such as extracting data from social networks, text analytics, and natural language processing using graphs and financial transaction systems on graphs. Finally, you will learn how to build and scale out data-driven applications for graph analytics to store, query, and process network information, before progressing to explore the latest trends on graphs. </p>
			<p>By the end of this machine learning book, you will have learned the essential concepts of graph theory and all the algorithms and techniques used to build successful machine learning applications.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for data analysts, graph developers, graph analysts, and graph professionals who want to leverage the information embedded in the connections and relations between data points, unravel hidden structures, and exploit topological information to boost their analysis and models' performance. The book will also be useful for data scientists and machine learning developers who want to build machine learning-driven graph databases. A beginner-level understanding of graph databases and graph data is required. An intermediate-level working knowledge of Python programming and machine learning is also expected to make the most out of this book.</p>
