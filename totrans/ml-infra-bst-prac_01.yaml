- en: Traditionally, Machine Learning (ML) was considered to be a niche domain in
    software engineering. No large software systems used statistical learning in production.
    This changed in the 2010s when recommendation systems started to utilize large
    quantities of data – for example, to recommend movies, books, or music. With the
    rise of transformer technologies, this has changed. Commonly known products such
    as ChatGPT popularized these techniques and showed that they are no longer niche
    products, but have entered the mainstream software products and services. Software
    engineering needs to keep up and we need to know how to create the software based
    on these modern machine learning models. In this first part of the book, we look
    at how machine learning changes software development and how we need to adapt
    to these changes.
