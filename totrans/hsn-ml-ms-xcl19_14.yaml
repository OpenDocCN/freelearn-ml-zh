    activities to the cloud. In this chapter, you will find information about how
    to use Azure services and get a free subscription to test them. Deep learning
    seems to be the path to general Artificial Intelligence, that is, machines that
    can think as humans. We are not even close to that yet, but artificial neural
    networks are used in computer vision, text and speech analysis, and many other
    advanced applications. There are many use cases for artificial intelligence that
    are pre-built inside Azure and that can be used by building an experiment, as
    shown in detail in this chapter.
