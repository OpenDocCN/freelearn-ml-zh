- en: 'It seems like machine learning and artificial intelligence is all the rage,
    both in hip tech companies and increasingly in larger enterprise companies. Data
    scientists are using machine learning to do everything from drive cars to draw
    cats. However, if you follow the data science community, you have very likely
    seen something like *language wars* unfold between Python and R users. These languages
    dominate the machine learning conversation and often seem to be the only choices
    to integrate machine learning in your organization. We will explore a third option
    in this book: Go, the open source programming language created at Google.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The unique features of Go, along with the mindset of Go programmers, can help
    data scientists overcome some of the common struggles that they encounter. In
    particular, data scientists are (unfortunately) known to produce bad, inefficient,
    and unmaintainable code. This book will address this issue, and will clearly show
    you how to be productive in machine learning while also producing applications
    that maintain a high level of integrity. It will also allow you to overcome the
    common challenges of integrating analysis and machine learning code within an
    existing engineering organization.

    leverage Go to build robust and valuable applications. To this end, the book will
    clearly introduce the technical, programming aspects of machine learning in Go,
    but it will also guide the reader to understand sound workflows and philosophies
    for real-world analysis.

    Data*, covers the gathering, organization, and parsing of data to/from a local
    and remote sources. Once the reader is done with this chapter, they will understand
    how to interact with data stored in various places and in various formats, how
    to parse and clean that data, and how to output that cleaned and parsed data.'

    Once the reader is done with this material, they will understand how to form matrices
    within Go programs and how to utilize these matrices to perform various types
    of matrix operations. This chapter also covers statistical measures and operations
    key to day-to-day data analysis work. Once the reader is done with this chapter,
    they will understand how to perform solid summary data analysis, describe and
    visualize distributions, quantify hypotheses, and transform datasets with, for
    example, dimensionality reductions.'

    machine applications and ensuring that they generalize. Once the reader is done
    with this chapter, they will understand various metrics to gauge the performance
    of models (in other words, **evaluate** the model) as well as various techniques
    to validate the model more generally.'

    for other models. Regression produces models that are immediately interpretable.
    Thus, it can provide an excellent starting point when introducing predictive capabilities
