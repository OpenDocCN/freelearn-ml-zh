- en: This book provides practical guidelines on how to use machine learning algorithms
    to create predictive models. It is very common to learn about machine learning
    in tutorials using *toy*, or small, datasets, which is very practical for learning
    the basic concepts but not enough when trying to apply what you've learned to
    real problems.

- en: This book covers the main steps to be followed in order to develop predictive
    models based on machine learning algorithms. Data collection, data treatment,
    univariate and multivariate analysis, and the application of the most common machine
    learning algorithms are some of the steps described in this book. This is a programming
    book, containing several lines of code, therefore you could replicate all the
    steps described in it.

- en: This book shows how there are no unique modeling possibilities; different existing
    options in each modeling step are key to achieving accurate and useful models.

- en: The applications included in this book have been based on the financial sector.
    This is mainly because I am familiar with the information and the problems, and
    because there is a huge amount of data to apply several techniques to in a way
    that is representative of problems that can be found in real life.

- en: The theoretical framework of the book is based on explaining the financial crisis
    and its causes. Would we be able to predict the next financial crisis? If not,
    at least you will learn very useful techniques for squeezing your data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a useful textbook for graduate students and is a reference book
    for researchers and machine learning and big data practitioners who want to know
    how to deal with large amounts of data and the main problems that arise in both
    the development of predictive models and the application of machine learning algorithms.
    It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning and describes several
    key aspects of the application of algorithms. The book is focused on credit risk
    and the financial crisis, so it could also be interesting for researchers in that
    field.

    predictive power of variables and their relationship to the target variable. Additionally,
    as the number of variables is high, some techniques to reduce the number of variables
    are also included in this chapter.'

    machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression, regularized methods, gradient
    boosting, neural networks, and **Support Vector Machines** (**SVM**) are briefly
    explained and implemented, to try to obtain an accurate model for predicting bank
    failures. This chapter also includes some basic guidelines on combining the results
    of different models to improve the accuracy of our model, and how to generate
    models in an automatic and visual way.'

    debt crisis, which shook even the foundations and solvency of the European Union.
    This chapter shows how macroeconomic imbalances in different countries can be
    measured. Specifically, this chapter will help you to understand clustering analysis,
    unsupervised models in nature, and how these techniques can help with even supervised
    problems.'
