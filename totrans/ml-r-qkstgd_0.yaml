  zh: 前言
- en: This book provides practical guidelines on how to use machine learning algorithms
    to create predictive models. It is very common to learn about machine learning
    in tutorials using *toy*, or small, datasets, which is very practical for learning
    the basic concepts but not enough when trying to apply what you've learned to
    real problems.

  zh: 本书提供了关于如何使用机器学习算法创建预测模型的实际指南。在教程中使用*玩具*或小型数据集来学习机器学习是很常见的，这对于学习基本概念非常实用，但在尝试将所学应用于实际问题时不充分。
- en: This book covers the main steps to be followed in order to develop predictive
    models based on machine learning algorithms. Data collection, data treatment,
    univariate and multivariate analysis, and the application of the most common machine
    learning algorithms are some of the steps described in this book. This is a programming
    book, containing several lines of code, therefore you could replicate all the
    steps described in it.

  zh: 本书涵盖了基于机器学习算法开发预测模型的主要步骤。数据收集、数据处理、单变量和多变量分析以及应用最常用的机器学习算法是本书中描述的一些步骤。这是一本编程书，包含多行代码，因此你可以复制书中描述的所有步骤。
- en: This book shows how there are no unique modeling possibilities; different existing
    options in each modeling step are key to achieving accurate and useful models.

  zh: 这本书展示了为什么不存在唯一的建模可能性；在每一个建模步骤中存在的不同选项是实现准确和有用模型的关键。
- en: The applications included in this book have been based on the financial sector.
    This is mainly because I am familiar with the information and the problems, and
    because there is a huge amount of data to apply several techniques to in a way
    that is representative of problems that can be found in real life.

  zh: 本书中的应用案例基于金融行业。这主要是因为我对信息和问题很熟悉，并且因为存在大量数据可以应用多种技术，这可以代表现实生活中可以找到的问题。
- en: The theoretical framework of the book is based on explaining the financial crisis
    and its causes. Would we be able to predict the next financial crisis? If not,
    at least you will learn very useful techniques for squeezing your data.

  zh: 本书面向的对象
- en: This book is a useful textbook for graduate students and is a reference book
    for researchers and machine learning and big data practitioners who want to know
    how to deal with large amounts of data and the main problems that arise in both
    the development of predictive models and the application of machine learning algorithms.
    It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning and describes several
    key aspects of the application of algorithms. The book is focused on credit risk
    and the financial crisis, so it could also be interesting for researchers in that
    field.
