- en: Computer vision systems are deployed in the Arctic Ocean to spot icebergs at
    night. They are flown over the Amazon rainforest to create aerial maps of fires,
    blights, and illegal logging. They are set up in ports and airports worldwide
    to scan for suspects and contraband. They are sent to the depths of the Marianas
    Trench to guide autonomous submarines. They are used in operating rooms to help
    surgeons visualize the planned procedure and the patient's current condition.
    They are launched from battlefields as the steering systems of heat-seeking, anti-aircraft
    rockets.

- en: We might seldom—or never—visit these places. However, stories often encourage
    us to imagine extreme environments and a person's dependence on tools in these
    unforgiving conditions. Perhaps fittingly, one of contemporary fiction's most
    popular characters is an almost ordinary man (handsome, but not *too* handsome;
    clever, but not *too* clever) who wears a suit, works for the British Government,
    always chooses the same drink, the same kind of woman, the same tone for delivering
    a pun, and is sent to do dangerous jobs with a peculiar collection of gadgets.

- en: This book discusses seriously useful technologies and techniques, with a healthy
    dose of inspiration from spy fiction. The Bond franchise is rich in ideas about
    detection, disguise, smart devices, image capture, and sometimes, even computer
    vision specifically. With imagination, plus dedication to learning new skills,
    we can become the next generation of gadget makers to rival Bond's engineer, Q!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for tinkerers (and spies) who want to make computer vision a practical
    and fun part of their lifestyle. You should already be comfortable with 2D graphical
    concepts, object-oriented languages, GUIs, networking, and the command line. This
    book does not assume experience with any specific libraries or platforms. Detailed
    instructions cover everything from setting up the development environment to deploying
    finished apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A desire to learn multiple technologies and techniques, and then integrate them,
    is highly beneficial! This book will help you branch out to understand several
    types of systems and application domains where computer vision is relevant, and
    will help you to apply several approaches to detect, recognize, track, and augment
    faces, objects, and motions.
