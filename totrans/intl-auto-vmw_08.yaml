    how it works. We'll also discuss how intelligent data summarization happens and
    its ability to cluster similar messages together. vRealize Log Insight also has
    automatic schema extraction. It has the capability to perform rapid troubleshooting
    across physical, virtual, and cloud environments by indexing and intelligent grouping,
    which assists in searching for quick resolutions with exact root cause analysis.

    specifically designed to handle the high scale of modern cloud applications' velocity
    and dynamism. DevOps and developer teams who run true cloud-native apps (such
    as Box, and so on) use Wavefront to monitor their cloud services. Wavefront has
    capability to reach an **unprecedented scale**. The Wavefront platform collects
    metrics from distributed applications, containers, microservices, hybrid public
    cloud infrastructure, and even business data. Once metric data is in the Wavefront
    time-series database, we can apply powerful and flexible analytics in the form
    of the Wavefront Query Language.

    defined as per rate of ingestion and per host with vRealize Operations Manager.
    Customers can see metric rate consumption clearly, tweak it as needed, and use
    it for budgeting without any hidden costs. Wavefront data sources are native metrics
    ingestion by integrating open source agents, API, code libraries and events, metrics
    from logs, and other tools (DevOps and so on) . It can easily scale up to 4,000,000 **packets

    devices periodically (between 5 and 10 minutes on average) on a read-only basis.

    is typically configured as highly restrictive. In most cases, the vRNI proxy node,
