    (**AI**) and **Machine Learning** (**ML**) for their critical business decision-making
    process, it becomes an immediate expectation to interpret and demystify **black-box
    algorithms** to increase their adoption. AI and ML are being increasingly utilized
    for determining our day-to-day experiences across multiple areas, such as banking,
    healthcare, education, recruitment, transport, and supply chain. But the integral
    role played by AI and ML models has led to the growing concern of business stakeholders
    and consumers about the lack of transparency and interpretability as these black-box
    algorithms are highly subjected to human bias; particularly for high-stake domains,
    such as healthcare, finance, legal, and other critical industrial operations,
    model explainability is a prerequisite.

    tries to learn these instructions from the data. As illustrated in *Figure 1.1*,

    automatically decipher interesting patterns and insights from the data and provide
    *silver bullet* outcomes! As compared to conventional rule-based computer programs,
    which are limited by the intelligence of the programmer, well-trained ML algorithms
    are considered to provide rich insights and accurate predictions even in complex
    situations. But the fact is, all ML models suffer from *bias*, which can be due
    to the **inductive bias** of the algorithm itself, or it can be due to the presence
    of bias in the dataset used for training the model. In practice, there can be
    other reasons, such as **data drift**, **concept drift**, and **overfitted** or
    **underfitted** models, for which model predictions can go wrong. As the famous
    British statistician George E.P. Box once said, *"All models are wrong, but some
    are useful"*; all statistical, scientific, and ML models can give incorrect outcomes
    if the initial assumptions of these methods are not consistent. Therefore, it
    is important for us to know why an ML model predicted a specific outcome, what
    can be done if it is wrong, and how the predictions can be improved.

    let me try to give some practical examples of low-stake and high-stake domains
    to understand the consequences of poor predictions. Weather forecasting is one
    of the classical forecasting problems that is extremely challenging (as it depends
    on multiple dynamic factors) where ML is extensively used, and the ability of
    ML algorithms to consider multiple parameters of different types makes it more
    efficient than standard statistical models to predict the weather. Despite having
    highly accurate forecast models, there are times when weather forecasting algorithms
    might miss the prediction of rainfall, even though it starts raining after a few
    minutes! But the consequences of such a poor prediction might not be so severe,
    and moreover, most people do not blindly rely on automated weather predictions,
    thus making weather forecasting a low-stake domain problem.

  zh: 在完全同意我对模型可解释性必要性的观点之前，让我尝试给出一些低风险和高风险领域的实际例子，以了解不良预测的后果。天气预报是极具挑战性的经典预测问题之一（因为它依赖于多个动态因素），机器学习在这里得到了广泛的应用，机器学习算法考虑多种不同类型的参数的能力使其比标准统计模型在预测天气方面更加高效。尽管拥有高度准确的预测模型，但有时天气预报算法可能会错过降雨的预测，尽管几分钟后就开始下雨了！但这样的不良预测的后果可能并不严重，而且大多数人并不盲目依赖自动化的天气预报，这使得天气预报成为一个低风险领域问题。
- en: Similarly, for another low-stake domain, such as a content recommendation system,
    even if an ML algorithm provides an irrelevant recommendation, at the most, the
    end users might spend more time explicitly searching for relevant content. While
    the overall experience of the end user might be impacted, still, there is no severe
    loss of life or livelihood. Hence, the need for model explainability is not critical
    for low-stake domains, but providing explainability to model predictions does
    make the automated intelligent systems more trustworthy and reliable for end users,
    thus increasing AI adoption by enhancing the end user experience.

    a severe loss of reputation and valuation of a company, impacting many lives!

    algorithms (for more information, please refer to the sources mentioned in the

    way. Especially for deep neural network models, each layer tries to learn different
    types of features. When model predictions are incorrect, understanding how different
    parts of a model can affect or control the final outcome is very important. So,
    explainability techniques can unravel insights from different parts of a model
    and help debug and observe the algorithm's robustness for different data points.

    image data. But DenseNet is not intrinsically interpretable, and explaining the
    algorithm's working to any non-technical end user can be pretty complicated and
    challenging. So, highly accurate models, such as deep neural networks, are non-linear
    and more complex and can capture complex relationships and patterns from the data,
    but achieving interpretability is difficult for these models. Highly interpretable

    domains, where the consequences of poor predictions are severe, I would recommend
    going for more interpretable models even if accuracy is being sacrificed. Any
    rule-based heuristic model that is highly interpretable can be very effective
    in such situations. But if the problem is well studied, and getting the least
    prediction error is the main goal (such as in any academic use case or any ML
    competitions) such that the consequences of poor prediction will not create any
    significant damage, then going for highly accurate models can be preferred. In

    trust in such explanations. However, it is challenging to introduce prior knowledge
    of humans into ML models. But human-friendly explainable ML systems should try

    or other reasons. Similarly, high blood glucose levels can also be momentary and
    a high blood glucose level doesn't always mean that the patient has diabetes.

    instance or a specific subset of the data. For example, for doing sales forecasting,
    providing explanations based on just the trend of historical data doesn''t give
    a complete picture, as other factors, such as production capacity, market competition,

    includes comparing with another instance''s prediction that is significantly higher
    or lower. Similarly, a good explanation for classification problems is about comparing
    the current prediction with other possible outcomes. But contrastive explanations

    can efficiently understand the working of the model. So, using a linear regression
    model for use cases such as sales forecasting can help us to understand the overall
    trend of the historical data and how the forecasted values are related to the
    trend.

    other metrics such as description length of explanation, the complexity of the
    features used in the explanation, and cognitive processing time required to understand
    the provided explanation, are often used. We will discuss them in more detail
    in [*Chapter 11*](B18216_11_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor217), *End User-Centered Artificial
    Intelligence*.

    in this mind-map diagram as we will be using it throughout the book! Let's summarize
    what we have discussed in the summary section.

    is so important. You have learned about the various terms and concepts related
    to explainability techniques, which we will frequently use throughout this book.
    You have also learned about certain key criteria of human-friendly explainable
    ML systems and different approaches to evaluating the quality of the explainability
    techniques. In the next chapter, we will focus on various types of model explainability
    methods for structured and unstructured data.
