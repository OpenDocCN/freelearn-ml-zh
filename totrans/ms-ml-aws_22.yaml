    you get started with AWS by creating an account if not done already. Please visit
    [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
    . You will need to provide some credit card details, but you will only get charged
    after you effectively use the different services. Consider that many of the services
    have a free tier which you can start using at no cost. Once you sign up, the next
    step is to create a user on the platform which you will use for programmatic access.

    machine, as explained in [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html).
     By storing the credentials on that file, the code you run on your machine will
    know how to authenticate with AWS.
