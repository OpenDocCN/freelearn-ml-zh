    not discussed in detail in data science programs or books. Although the topic
    of understanding and defining business problems is mentioned very briefly as something
    that should be done, it is very rare that the discussion will go into how to actually
    do it properly. In this chapter, we will go into specific tools and methods that
    can be used to gain an understanding of the system under consideration and determine
    the problem that needs to be solved.

    you gain this skill, you will become invaluable. This is a key area where there
    will always be a need for experienced data scientists (or whatever they are called

- en: All problems arise within the context of a system. A system could be a single
    cell of an organism, a global population, or the entire economy. In the same way,
    all solutions need to fit into a system. A technological solution (for example,
    an AI solution) will typically require changes to processes, people, skills, other
    IT systems, or even the business model for it to be effective. For an organization,
    the system could be its entire supply chain, competitors, and customers. Given
    that a system's definition can be very broad, it is generally advisable that you
    imagine a system to be broader than the problems you are considering. You want
    all the components or agents that your problem touches to be part of the system
    context. Defining the system boundary is part art and part science, and it is
    an iterative process. Given that you will be looking at the system from a broader
    perspective, this also means that the same system context will be valid for multiple
    ML projects or use cases. The understanding you gain here will pay dividends across
    many projects.

  zh: 所有问题都出现在系统的背景下。系统可能是一个生物体的单个细胞、全球人口或整个经济。同样，所有解决方案都需要适应系统。技术解决方案（例如，人工智能解决方案）通常需要改变流程、人员、技能、其他IT系统，甚至商业模式才能有效。对于一个组织来说，系统可能是其整个供应链、竞争对手和客户。鉴于系统的定义可能非常广泛，通常建议你想象系统比你所考虑的问题更广泛。你希望你的问题所触及的所有组成部分或代理都成为系统背景的一部分。定义系统边界既是艺术又是科学，并且是一个迭代过程。鉴于你将从更广泛的视角审视系统，这也意味着相同的系统背景将适用于多个机器学习项目或用例。在这里获得的理解将在许多项目中带来回报。
- en: Data scientists or analysts who might have worked in an organization or industry
    would have intuitively learned many of the systemic aspects of the problem. They
    might feel that they do not need to look into this further as they already understand
    key issues. While that might be true, it is also true that people develop blind
    spots and start to overlook key missing pieces or carry implicit assumptions that
    are mostly correct but sometimes wrong. Using structured methods to capture systemic
    understanding helps overcome these problems and also ensures that everyone is
    working from a common understanding. These issues are typically ones leading to
    problems or delays in projects downstream. Let's look at how we build this understanding
    by creating a context diagram.

    conventions that you like or are already familiar with. In this book, we will
    follow certain conventions that are amenable to computational modeling. What that
    means is that these diagrams can be combined with data and turned into models
    that can be used for analysis. This will become important in the later stages
    of our project. In-depth details of how to create these diagrams and turn them
    into computational models are beyond the scope of this book, but if you are interested
    you can seek out other sources to learn about these techniques. Even if you do
    not create computational models, these diagrams will provide useful insights that

- en: Based on the system context, you already know the most important processes in
    an organization. You can start building diagrams for these key processes—or at
    the very least, the one that is relevant to your project. It is important to build
    end-to-end process flows—for example, the entire customer journey, or the entire
    development process for a product. It is also important to understand the process
    from a customer's viewpoint (gray boxes) and not just internal processes (white
    boxes). Make sure to capture failure points or rework paths, or where a process
    might end abruptly instead of normal completion. As entities flow through these
    processes, decisions or computations are made that could be candidate ML problems.
    Regardless of the project you are starting from, it is a good idea to identify
    other potential opportunities along the way. It may turn out that looking at the
    process differently or building a different ML model could provide larger benefit
    or might preempt a need for the current project. Whether or not that turns out
    to be the case, it is important to capture this information. By the way, did you
    notice in the preceding process diagram that the customer is not receiving a reject
    message? As you can imagine, this is an important part of the customer experience
    that is being left out. I am sure that error will be caught at some point, but
    making the process explicit increases the odds of catching it sooner and taking
    it into account as you are building your models.

    You will frequently run into situations where someone has already built a process
    diagram but did not capture any data. If you are reading this book, then I do
    not need to tell you how important collecting that data is for accurately understanding
    the process. Typical information to be captured is counts and types of objects
    flowing through each step, time taken at each step, labor hours and resources
    required at each step, probability of taking a specific path, quality metrics,
    and so on. If such information is not being captured for key processes, then it
    is important to start collecting this information as soon as possible. This information
    could be critical for building a business case for your project, serving as useful
    features in the model, and helping identify problems that might be otherwise hidden.

    assumed to be instantaneous. You can also think of the transitions in terms of
    transition probabilities (in which case, it starts resembling a Markov chain).
    The diagrams can be hierarchical in the sense that a state can be decomposed into
    sub-states, and those sub-states can be interconnected via transitions.

    to take place. Is it deterministic or is it random? You also want to collect data
    about how often and when these transitions take place as this data is very useful
    for further analysis, as well as for building ML models. Transitions of one actor
    might cause a transition in another actor's state, thus state diagrams are also
    connected to interaction diagrams. Each of the transitions is a potential candidate
    for an ML model, where you can use data to predict when a transition (and which
    one) might fire. As you can imagine, building these diagrams will lead to the
    identification of opportunities that might otherwise be missed.

    an example—it doesn't show all the causal influences). It says that as interest
    rates go up, home sales decline. Home sales are also influenced by demand and
    prices. As prices go up, the rising prices can increase demand as more people
    want to buy homes to make money, but the price itself is a deterrent. You can
    see that there are opposing effects and feedback loops present in this simple
    diagram. No wonder the dynamics confound us, and this frequently leads to the
    system going haywire. Everyone thinks they understand how the housing market works,
    but real understanding is difficult to achieve in the presence of complex dynamics.
    Similar dynamics are at play in many business situations. It is easy to build
    an ML model to predict home prices, but it is much harder to understand the overall
    dynamics. This lack of understanding can lead to a situation where you are using
    excellent ML models to make bad decisions, hence building such models is critical

    diagram into a composite view that can be very instructive. Imagine the journey
    of a product as it changes state, going from a *raw product* to a *shipped product*.
    Each box in this case represents the quantity of a product in a specific state—for
    example, the **Assembled Product** box represents all products that have been
    assembled and are now waiting to become *finished products*. This happens at a
    rate called the *finish rate*. The finish rate is dependent on how many assemblers
    are available to perform the work. You will also notice that some assembled products
    turn out to be defective. These products flow into the **Defective Product** box
    at a rate called the *defect rate*. These then have to be repaired by repairers.
    Because of defects, the shipping target is not met and there is a shortfall. This
    shortfall increases pressure on the employees, which increases burnout. The burnout
    in turn reduces the number of assemblers (they quit or get sick). Since the number
    of assemblers is reduced, this slows down the finish rate. This in turn increases
    the pressure and more people are shifted to become repairers, as repairs can be
    done faster. This leaves no one working as preventers and causes the vicious cycle
    to continue, with the process becoming more and more backlogged.

    how the defects can be reduced. This will require the manufacturing team to work
    closely with the data science team to find a solution. Again, the key point is
    that unless someone does this analysis, the data science team is likely to be

    a causal diagram and can be used as a starting point for building a causal model

    of the exercise is to understand the root cause and work on fixing this. I hope
    you are beginning to see that accurately predicting something is not always the
    same as fixing the real problem, and you have to be a bit careful about setting
    up your ML problem for your project to be successful. Also, notice that there
    might be multiple causes leading up to a problem and you might have to address
    multiple issues in order to see significant mitigation of the problem. On the
    other hand, addressing only one aspect (say, employee burnout) without understanding
    the full picture could lead you to conclude that burnout is not a problem. It

    looks like and start discussing with users and stakeholders the details of actions
    to be taken. The models you have helped build are likely to introduce many changes

    features to a target, we can also see how the target affects other parts of the
    system. The diagram should reveal how the target impacts key objectives or outcomes;
    it should also reveal key feedback loops that will change the behavior of the
    rest of the system, as well as giving a hint of other consequences. This makes
    it relatively straightforward to understand and compute the **return on investment**
    (**ROI**) from your model. A common challenge expressed by data science teams
    is that they find it hard to express the impacts of a model. As you can now see,

    the model will provide a positive ROI, it might cause performance to degrade in
    other areas, such that you might not want to go forward with it. Some of these
    consequences could be in the areas of regulatory or ethical issues. These areas

    This allows you to understand the dynamic behavior of your system and can serve

    help you avoid costly mistakes—it can often also suggest improvements or strategies
    to further optimize the benefits. The reasons many data science projects do not

    generate a promotion price. This model monitors the sales and updates the price
    accordingly. For some reason (database updates, approvals, and so on), there is
    a delay involved in updating these prices on the e-commerce site. This creates
    a lag in the sales data that is not known to the modeling team because the modeling
    team did not understand the entire flow and how much time it takes to update prices
    on the site. If you were to do an analysis of this simple diagram, you would discover
    that such feedback loops with delays produce oscillating behavior. This means
    that the pricing will always be off—sometimes higher and sometimes lower. This
    behavior is somewhat similar to what you see in most model results anyway, so
    it is entirely possible that this effect will be missed. The system will perform
    poorly even though the model itself was fine. I have kept this example very simple
    to make a point. You can imagine that if the situation were more complex, most
