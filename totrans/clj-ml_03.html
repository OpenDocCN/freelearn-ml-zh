We will examine a handful of techniques for classifying data and also study how we can leverage these techniques in Clojure.</p><p>Classification can be defined as the problem of identifying the category or class of the observed data based on some empirical training data. The training data will have the values of the observable features or independent variables. It will also have a known category for these observed values. Classification is similar to regression in the sense that we predict a value based on another set of values. However, for classification, we are interested in the category of the observed values rather than predicting a value based on the given set of values. For example, if we train a linear regression model from a set of output values ranging from <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>5</em></span>, the trained classifier could predict the output value as <span class="emphasis"><em>10</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>-1</em></span> for a set of input values. In classification, however, the predicted value of the output variable always belongs to a discrete set of values.</p><p>The independent variables of a classification model are also termed as the <span class="emphasis"><em>explanatory variables</em></span> of<a id="id211" class="indexterm"/> the model, and the dependent variable is also called the <span class="emphasis"><em>outcome</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>category</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>class</em></span> of the observed values. The outcome of a classification model is always a discrete value, that is, a value from a predetermined set of values. This is one of the primary differences between classification and regression, as we predict a variable that can have a continuous range of values in regression modeling. Note that the terms "category" and "class" are used interchangeably in the context of classification.</p><p>Algorithms that implement classification techniques are called classifiers. A <span class="strong"><strong>classifier</strong></span><a id="id212" class="indexterm"/> can be formally defined as a function that maps a set of values to a category or class. Classification is still an active area of research in computer science, and there are several prominent classifier algorithms that are used in software today. There are several practical applications of classification, such as data mining, machine vision, speech and handwriting recognition, biological classification, and geostatistics.</p><div class="section" title="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec23"/>Understanding the binary and multiclass classification</h1></div></div></div><p>We will first study some theoretical aspects about data classification. As with other supervised machine learning techniques, the goal is to estimate a model or classifier from the sample data and use it to predict a given set of outcomes. Classification can be thought of as a way of determining a<a id="id213" class="indexterm"/> function that maps the features of the sample data to a specific class. The predicted class is selected from a given set of predetermined classes. Thus, similar to regression, the problem of classifying the observed values for the given independent variables is analogous to determining a best-fit function for the given training data.</p><p>In some cases, we might be interested in only a single class, that is, whether the observed values belong to a specific class. This form of classification is termed as <span class="strong"><strong>binary classification</strong></span><a id="id214" class="indexterm"/>, and the output variable of the model can have either the value <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>. Thus, we can say that <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_01.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>, where <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> is the outcome or dependent variable of the classification model. The outcome is said to be negative when <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_03.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>, and conversely, the outcome is termed positive when <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_04.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>.</p><p>In this perspective, when some observed values for the independent variables of the model are provided, we must be able to determine the probability of a positive outcome. Thus, the estimated model of the given sample data has the probability <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_05.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> and can be expressed as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_06.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>In the preceding equation, the parameters <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_07.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> represent the independent variables of the estimated classification model <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_08.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>, and the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_09.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> represents the estimated parameter vector of this model.</p><p>An example<a id="id215" class="indexterm"/> of this kind of classification is deciding whether a new e-mail is spam or not, depending on the sender or the content within the e-mail. Another simple example of binary classification is determining the possibility of rainfall on a particular day depending on the observed humidity and the minimum and maximum temperatures on that day. The training data for this example might appear similar to the data in the following table:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_10.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>A mathematical function that we can use to model binary classification is the <span class="strong"><strong>sigmoid</strong></span><a id="id216" class="indexterm"/> or <span class="strong"><strong>logistic</strong></span> function. If the<a id="id217" class="indexterm"/> outcome for the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> has an estimated parameter vector <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_12.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>, we can define the estimated probability of the positive outcome <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> (as a sigmoid function) as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_13.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>To visualize the preceding equation, we can simplify it by substituting <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> as <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_14.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_15.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>We could model the data using several other functions as well. However, the sample data for a binary classifier can be easily transformed such that it can be modeled using a sigmoid function. This modeling of a classification problem using the logistic function is called <span class="strong"><strong>logistic regression</strong></span><a id="id218" class="indexterm"/>. The simplified sigmoid function defined in the preceding equation produces the following plot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_16.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>Note that if the term <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> has a negative value, the plot appears reversed and is a mirror of the previous plot. We can visualize how<a id="id219" class="indexterm"/> the sigmoid function varies with respect to the term <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>, through the following plot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_18.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>In the previous graph, the sigmoid function is shown for different values of the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_20.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>; it ranges from <span class="emphasis"><em>-5</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>5</em></span>. Note that for two dimensions, the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_20.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> is a linear function of the independent variable <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. Interestingly, for <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_21.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_22.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>, the sigmoid function looks more or less like a straight line. This function reduces to a straight line when <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_23.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> and can be represented by a constant <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> value (the equation <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_24.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> in this case).</p><p>We observe that the<a id="id220" class="indexterm"/> estimated outcome <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> is always between <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>, as it represents the probability of a positive outcome for the given observed values. Also, this range of the outcome <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> is not affected by the sign of the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_25.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>. Thus, in retrospect, the sigmoid function is an effective representation of binary classification.</p><p>To use the logistic function to estimate a classification model from the training data, we can define the cost function of a logistic regression model as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_26.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>The preceding equation essentially sums up the differences between the actual and predicted values of the output variables in our model, just like linear regression. However, as we are dealing with probability values between <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>, we use the preceding log function to effectively measure the differences between the actual and predicted output values. Note that the term <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> denotes the number of samples in the training data. We can apply the gradient descent to this cost function to determine the local minimum or rather the predicted class of a set of observed values. This equation can be regularized to produce the following cost function:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_27.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>Note that in this equation, the second summation term is added as a regularization term, like we discussed in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Understanding Linear Regression">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Understanding Linear Regression</em></span>. This term basically prevents the <span class="emphasis"><em>underfitting</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>overfitting</em></span> of the estimated model over the sample data. Note that the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_28.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> is the regularization parameter and has to be appropriately selected <a id="id221" class="indexterm"/>depending on how accurate we want the model to be.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Multiclass classification</strong></span><a id="id222" class="indexterm"/>, which is the other form of classification, predicts the outcome of the classification as a value from a specific set of predetermined values. Thus, the outcome is selected from <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> discrete values, that is, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_29.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>. This model produces <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> probabilities for each possible class of the observed values. This brings us to the following formal definition of multiclass classification:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_30.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>Thus, in multiclass classification, we predict <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> distinct values, in which each value indicates the probability of the input values belonging to a particular class. Interestingly, binary classification can be reasoned as a specialization of multiclass classification in which there are only two possible classes, that is, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_31.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_01.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>.</p><p>As a special case of multiclass classification, we can say that the class with the maximum probability is the outcome or simply, the predicted class of the given set of observed values. This specialization of multiclass classification is called<a id="id223" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>one-vs-all</strong></span> classification<a id="id224" class="indexterm"/>. Here, a single class with the maximum (or minimum) probability of occurrence is determined from a given set of observed values instead of finding the probabilities of the occurrences of all the possible classes in our model. Thus, if we intend to predict a single class from a specific set of classes, we can define the outcome <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span> as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_32.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>For example, let's assume that we want to determine the classification model for a fish packing plant. In this scenario, the fish are separated into two distinct classes. Let's say that we can categorize the fish either as a sea bass or salmon. We can create some training data for our model by selecting a sufficiently large sample of fish and analyzing their distributions over some selected features. Let's say that we've identified two features to categorize the data, namely, the length of the fish and the lightness of its skin. </p><p>The distribution of the first feature, that is, the length of the fish, can be visualized as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_33.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>Similarly, the distribution <a id="id225" class="indexterm"/>of the lightness of the skin of the fish from the sample data can be visualized through the following plot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_35.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>From the preceding graphs, we can say that only specifying the length of the fish is not enough information to determine its type. Thus, this feature has a smaller coefficient in the classification model. On the contrary, since the lightness of the skin of the fish plays a larger role in determining the type of the fish, this feature will have a larger coefficient in the parameter vector of the estimated classification model.</p><p>Once we have modeled a given classification problem, we can partition the training data into two (or more) sets. The surface in the vector space that partitions these two sets is called the <span class="strong"><strong>decision boundary</strong></span><a id="id226" class="indexterm"/> of the formulated classification model. All the points on one side of the decision boundary are part of one class, while the points on the other side of the decision boundary are part<a id="id227" class="indexterm"/> of the other class. An obvious corollary is that depending on the number of distinct classes, a given classification model can have several such decision boundaries.</p><p>We can now combine these two features to train our model, and this produces an estimated decision boundary between the two categories of fish. This boundary can be visualized over a scatter plot of the training data as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_37.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>In the preceding plot, we approximate the classification model by using a straight line, and hence, we effectively model the classification as a linear function. We can alternatively model our data as a polynomial function, as it would produce a more accurate classification model. Such a model produces a decision boundary that can be visualized as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_39.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div><p>The decision boundary <a id="id228" class="indexterm"/>partitions the sample data into two dimensions as shown in the preceding graphs. The decision boundary will become more complex to visualize when the sample data has a higher <a id="id229" class="indexterm"/>number of features or dimensions. For example, for three features, the decision boundary will be a three-dimensional surface, as shown in the following plot. Note that the sample data points are not shown for the sake of clarity. Also, two of the plotted features are assumed to vary within the range <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_41.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>, and the third feature is assumed to vary within the range <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_42.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_43.jpg" alt="Understanding the binary and multiclass classification"/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Understanding the Bayesian classification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec24"/>Understanding the Bayesian classification</h1></div></div></div><p>We will now explore the<a id="id230" class="indexterm"/> Bayesian techniques that are used to classify data. A <span class="strong"><strong>Bayes</strong></span> classifier<a id="id231" class="indexterm"/> is essentially a probabilistic classifier that is built using the Bayes' theorem of conditional probability. A model based on the Bayes classification assumes that the sample data has strongly independent features. By <span class="emphasis"><em>independent</em></span>, we mean that every feature of the model can vary independent of the other features in the model. In other words, the features of the model are mutually exclusive. Thus, a Bayes classifier assumes that the presence or absence of a particular feature is completely independent of the presence or absence of the other features of the classification model.</p><p>The term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_45.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> is used to represent the probability of occurrence of the condition or the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. Its value is always a fractional value within the range of <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>, both inclusive. It can also be represented as a percentage valve. For example, the probability <span class="emphasis"><em>0.5</em></span> is also written as <span class="emphasis"><em>50%</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>50 percent</em></span>. Let's assume that we want to find the probability of occurrence of a feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_46.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, from a given number of samples. Thus, a higher value of <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_46.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> indicates a higher chance of occurrence of the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. We can formally represent the probability <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_46.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_47.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>If <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> are two conditions or features in our classification model, then we use the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_48.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> to represent the occurrence of <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> when <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> is known to have occurred. This value is called the <span class="strong"><strong>conditional probability</strong></span><a id="id232" class="indexterm"/> of <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> given <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>, and the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_48.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> is also read as the probability of <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> given <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>. In the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_48.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> is also called the evidence of <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. In conditional probability, the two events, <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>, may or may not be independent of each other. However, if <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> are indeed independent conditions,<a id="id233" class="indexterm"/> then the probability <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_48.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> is equal to the product of the probabilities of the separate occurrences of <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>. We can express this axiom as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_49.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>Bayes' theorem describes a relation between the conditional probabilities, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_48.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_50.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, and the probabilities, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_46.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_51.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>. It is formally expressed using the following equality:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_52.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>Of course, the probabilities, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_46.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_51.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, must both be greater than <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> for the preceding relation to be true.</p><p>Let's revisit the classification example of the fish packaging plant that we described earlier. The problem is that we need to determine whether a fish is a sea bass or salmon depending on its physical features. We will now implement a solution to this problem using a Bayes classifier. Then, we will use Bayes' theorem to model our data.</p><p>Let's assume that each category of fish has three independent and distinct features, namely, the lightness of its skin <a id="id234" class="indexterm"/>and its length and width. Hence, our training data will look like that in the following table:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_53.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>For simplicity in implementation, let's use the Clojure symbols to represent these features. We need to first generate the following data:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(defn make-sea-bass []
  ;; sea bass are mostly long and light in color
  #{:sea-bass
    (if (&lt; (rand) 0.2) :fat :thin)

    (if (&lt; (rand) 0.8) :light :dark)})

(defn make-salmon []
  ;; salmon are mostly fat and dark
  #{:salmon
    (if (&lt; (rand) 0.8) :fat :thin)
    (if (&lt; (rand) 0.5) :long :short)
    (if (&lt; (rand) 0.3) :light :dark)})

(defn make-sample-fish []
  (if (&lt; (rand) 0.3) (make-sea-bass) (make-salmon)))

(def fish-training-data
  (for [i (range 10000)] (make-sample-fish)))</pre></div><p>Here, we define two functions, <code class="literal">make-sea-bass</code> and <code class="literal">make-salmon</code>, to create a set of symbols to represent the two categories of fish. We conveniently use the<code class="literal">:salmon</code> and <code class="literal">:sea-bass</code> keywords to represent these two categories. Similarly, we can also use Clojure keywords to enumerate the features of a fish. In this example, the lightness of skin is either <code class="literal">:light</code> or <code class="literal">:dark</code>, the length is either <code class="literal">:long</code> or <code class="literal">:short</code>, and the width is either <code class="literal">:fat</code> or <code class="literal">:thin</code>. Also, we define the <code class="literal">make-sample-fish</code> function to randomly create a fish that is represented by the set of features defined earlier.</p><p>Note that we define these<a id="id235" class="indexterm"/> two categories of fish such that the sea bass are mostly long and light in skin color, and the salmon are mostly fat and dark. Also, we generate more salmon than sea bass in the <code class="literal">make-sample-fish</code> function<a id="id236" class="indexterm"/>. We add this partiality in our data only to provide more illustrative results, and the reader is encouraged to experiment with a more realistic distribution of data. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Iris</em></span> dataset, which is available in the Incanter library that we introduced in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Understanding Linear Regression">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Understanding Linear Regression</em></span>, is an example of a real-world dataset that can be used to study classification.</p><p>Now, we will implement the following function to calculate the probability of a particular condition:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(defn probability

        negative (- (count by-category) positive)
        total (+ positive negative)]
    (/ positive negative)))</pre></div><p>We essentially implement the basic definition of probability by the number of occurrences.</p><p>The <code class="literal">probability</code> function defined in the preceding code requires a single argument to represent the attribute or condition whose probability of occurrence we want to calculate. Also, the function accepts several optional arguments, such as the data to be used to calculate this value, which defaults to the <code class="literal">fish-training-data</code> sequence that we had defined earlier, and a category, which can be reasoned simply as another condition. The arguments, <code class="literal">category</code> and <code class="literal">attribute</code>, are in fact analogous to the conditions <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> in the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_48.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> probability. The <code class="literal">probability</code> function determines the total positive occurrences of the condition by filtering the training data using the <code class="literal">filter</code> function. It then determines the number of negative occurrences by calculating the difference between the positive and total number of values represented by <code class="literal">(count by-category)</code>, in the sample data. The function finally returns the ratio of the positive occurrences of the condition to the total number of occurrences in the given data. </p><p>Let's use the <code class="literal">probability</code> function to tell us a bit about our training data as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">user&gt; (probability :dark :category :salmon)

The probabilities of a sea bass being dark and a salmon being light are also low when compared to the probabilities of a sea bass being light and a salmon being dark.</p><p>Let's assume that our observed values for the features of a fish are that it is dark-skinned, long, and fat. Given these conditions, we need to classify the fish as either a sea bass or a salmon. In terms of probability, we need to determine the probability that a fish is a salmon or a sea bass given that the fish is dark, long, and fat. Formally, this probability is represented by the terms <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_55.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_56.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> for either category of fish. If we calculate these two probabilities, we can select the category with the highest of these two probabilities to determine the category of the fish.</p><p>Using Bayes' theorem, we define the terms, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_55.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_56.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_57.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_58.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>The terms, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_55.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_59.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, might seem a bit confusing, but the difference between these two terms is the order of occurrence of the specified conditions. The term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_60.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, represents the probability that a fish that is dark, long, and fat is a salmon, while the term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_61.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, represents the probability that a salmon is a dark, long, and fat fish.</p><p>The <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_62.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> probability can be calculated from the given training data as follows. As the three features of the fish are assumed to be mutually independent, the term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_62.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, is simply the<a id="id238" class="indexterm"/> product of the probabilities of the occurrences of each individual feature. By mutually independent, we mean that the variance or distribution of these features does not depend on any of the other features of the classification model.</p><p>The term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_62.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, is also called the <span class="strong"><strong>evidence</strong></span> of the given category, which is the category "salmon" in this case. We can express the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_62.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> probability as the product of the probabilities of the independent features of the model; this is shown as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_63.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>Interestingly, the terms, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_64.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_65.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_66.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, can be easily calculated from the training data and the <code class="literal">probability</code> function<a id="id239" class="indexterm"/>, which we had implemented earlier. Similarly, we can find the probability that a fish is a salmon or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_67.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>. Thus, the only term that's not accounted for in the definition of <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_60.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> is the term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_68.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>. We can actually avoid calculating this term altogether using a simple trick in probability.</p><p>Given that a fish is dark, long, and fat, it can either be a salmon or a sea bass. The two probabilities of occurrence of either category of fish are both complementary, that is, they both account for all the possible conditions that could occur in our model. In other words, these two probabilities both add up to a probability of <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>. Thus, we can formally express the term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_68.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_70.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>Both terms on the right-hand side of the preceding equality can be determined from the training data, which is similar to the terms, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_67.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_71.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, and so on. Hence, we can calculate the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_60.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> probability directly from our training data. We express this probability through the following equality:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_72.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>Now, let's implement the<a id="id240" class="indexterm"/> preceding equality using the training data and the <code class="literal">probability</code> function<a id="id241" class="indexterm"/>, which we defined earlier. Firstly, the evidence of a fish being a salmon, given that it's dark, long, and fat in appearance, can be expressed as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(defn evidence-of-salmon [&amp; attrs]
  (let [attr-probs (map #(probability % :category :salmon) attrs)
        class-and-attr-prob (conj attr-probs
                                  (probability :salmon))]
    (float (apply * class-and-attr-prob))))</pre></div><p>To be explicit, we implement a function to calculate the probability of the term, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_73.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, from the given training data. The equality of the terms, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_62.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_64.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_65.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_66.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> will be used as a base for this implementation.</p><p>In the preceding code, we determine the terms, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_67.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_74.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, for all the attributes or conditions of <span class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> by using the <code class="literal">probability</code> function. Then, we multiply all these terms using a composition of the <code class="literal">apply</code> and <code class="literal">*</code> functions. Since all the calculated probabilities are ratios returned by the <code class="literal">probability</code> function, we cast the final ratio to a floating-point value using the <code class="literal">float</code> function . We can try out this function in the REPL as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">user&gt; (evidence-of-salmon :dark)
0.4816
user&gt; (evidence-of-salmon :dark :long)
0.2396884
user&gt; (evidence-of-salmon)
0.6932</pre></div><p>As the REPL output indicates, 48.16 percent of all the fish in the training data are salmon with dark skin. Similarly, 23.96 percent of all the fish are dark and long salmon, and 69.32 percent of all the fish are salmon. The value returned by the <code class="literal">(evidence-of-salmon :dark :long)</code> call can be expressed as <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_75.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, and similarly, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_76.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> is returned by <code class="literal">(evidence-of-salmon)</code>.</p><p>Similarly, we can define the <code class="literal">evidence-of-sea-bass</code> function<a id="id242" class="indexterm"/> that determines the evidence of occurrence of<a id="id243" class="indexterm"/> a sea bass given some observed features of the fish. As we are dealing with only two categories, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_77.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span>, we can easily verify this equality in the REPL. Interestingly, a small error is observed, but this error is not related to the training data. This small error is, in fact, a floating-point rounding error, which arises due to the limitations of floating-point numbers. In practice, we can avoid this using the decimal or <code class="literal">BigDecimal</code> (from <code class="literal">java.lang</code>) data types, instead of floating-point numbers. We can verify this using the <code class="literal">evidence-of-sea-bass</code> and <code class="literal">evidence-of-salmon</code> functions in the REPL as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">user&gt; (+ (evidence-of-sea-bass) (evidence-of-salmon))

Let's first define a simple data structure<a id="id247" class="indexterm"/> that can be passed around. In the spirit of idiomatic Clojure, we conveniently use a map for this purpose. Using a map, we can represent a category in our model along with the evidence and probability of its occurrence.

Both expressions produce the same probability of 95.7 percent of a fish being a salmon, given that it's dark, long, and fat in appearance.

An obvious corollary is that given a single category, the <code class="literal">classify-by-attrs</code> function always predicts the supplied category with complete certainty, that is, a probability of <span class="emphasis"><em>1.0</em></span>. However, the evidence returned by this function vary depending on the observed features passed to it as well as the sample data that we used to train our model.</p><p>In a nutshell, the preceding implementation describes a Bayes classifier that can be trained using some sample data. It also classifies some observed values for the features of our model.</p><p>We can describe a generic Bayes classifier by building upon the definition of the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_60.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> probability from our previous example. To quickly recap, the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_60.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> can be formally expressed as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_72.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>In the preceding equality, we deal with a single class, namely salmon, and three mutually independent features, namely the length, width, and lightness of the skin of a fish.

If we are given a number of classes to choose from, we must select the class with the highest probability of occurrence. This brings us to the basic definition of a Bayes classifier, which is formally expressed as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_80.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>In the preceding equation, the function <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_81.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></span> describes a Bayes classifier that selects the class with the highest probability of occurrence.

Also, the variable <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span>, on the right-hand side of the equation, can have values from within a set of all the distinct classes in the classification model.</p><p>We can further simplify the preceding equation of a Bayes classifier via the <span class="strong"><strong>Maximum a Posteriori</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MAP</strong></span>) estimation,<a id="id257" class="indexterm"/> which can be thought of as a regularization of the features in Bayesian statistics. A simplified Bayes classifier can be formally expressed as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_84.jpg" alt="Understanding the Bayesian classification"/></div><p>This definition essentially means that the <span class="emphasis"><em>classify</em></span> function determines the class with the maximum probability of occurrence for the given features. Thus, the preceding equation describes a Bayes classifier that<a id="id258" class="indexterm"/> can be trained using some sample data and then be used to predict the class of a given set of observed values.

Of course, we will still maintain the partiality in our training data such that the salmon are mostly fat and dark-skinned, while the sea bass are mostly long and light-skinned. The following code implements this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(defn rand-in-range

In order to specify a particular attribute in the vector to represent the category of an entire set of observed values, we use the <code class="literal">dataset-set-class</code> function.

We can now use this trained classifier to predict the category of a set of observed values for the features of our model.</p><p>Let's first define the observed values that we intend to classify. To do so, we use the following <code class="literal">make-instance</code> function, which requires a dataset and a vector of observed values that agree with the data template of the supplied dataset:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(def sample-fish
  (make-instance fish-dataset [:salmon 5.0 6.0 3.0]))</pre></div><p>Here, we simply defined a<a id="id270" class="indexterm"/> sample fish using the <code class="literal">make-instance</code> function<a id="id271" class="indexterm"/>. We can now predict the class of the fish represented by <code class="literal">sample-fish</code> as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">user&gt; (classifier-classify bayes-classifier sample-fish)
:salmon</pre></div><p>As shown in the preceding code, the fish is classified as a <code class="literal">salmon</code>. Note that although we provide the class of the fish as <code class="literal">:salmon</code> while defining <code class="literal">sample-fish</code>, it's only for conformance with the data template defined by <code class="literal">fish-dataset</code>. In fact, we could specify the class of <code class="literal">sample-fish</code> as <code class="literal">:sea-bass</code> or a third value, say <code class="literal">:unknown</code>, to represent an undefined value, and the classifier would still classify <code class="literal">sample-fish</code> as a <code class="literal">salmon</code>.</p><p>When dealing with the continuous values for the various features of the given classification model, we can specify a Bayes classifier to use discretization of continuous features. By this, we mean that all the values for the various features of the model will be converted to discrete values by the probability density estimation. We can specify this option to the <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function<a id="id272" class="indexterm"/> by simply passing an extra argument, <code class="literal">{:supervised-discretization true}</code>, to the function. This map actually describes all the possible options that can be provided to the specified classifier.</p><p>In conclusion, the <code class="literal">clj-ml</code> library provides<a id="id273" class="indexterm"/> a fully operational Bayes classifier that we can use to classify arbitrary data. Although we generated the training data ourselves in the previous example, this data can be fetched from the Web or a database as well.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec25"/>Using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm</h1></div></div></div><p>A simple technique that can be used to classify a set of observed values is the <span class="strong"><strong>k-nearest neighbors</strong></span> (abbreviated as <span class="strong"><strong>k-NN</strong></span>) algorithm. This algorithm is a form of <span class="strong"><strong>lazy learning</strong></span> in which all the computation is deferred until classification. Also, in the classification phase, the k-NN algorithm approximates the class of the observed values using only a few values from the training data, and the reading of other values is deferred until they are actually needed.</p><p>While we now explore the k-NN algorithm<a id="id274" class="indexterm"/> in the context of classification, it can be applied to regression as well by simply selecting the predicted value as the average of the nearest values of the dependent variable for a set of observed feature values. Interestingly, this technique of modeling regression is, in fact, a generalization of <span class="strong"><strong>linear interpolation</strong></span><a id="id275" class="indexterm"/> (for more information, refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression</em></span>).</p><p>The k-NN algorithm reads<a id="id276" class="indexterm"/> some training data and analyzes this data lazily, that is, only when needed. Apart from the training data, the algorithm requires a set of observed values and a constant <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> as parameters to classify the set of observed values. To classify these observed values, the algorithm predicts the class that is the most frequent among the <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> training samples nearest to the set of observed values. By nearest, we mean a point with the least Euclidean distance from the point that is represented by a set of observed values in the Euclidean space of the training data.</p><p>An obvious corollary is that when <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_85.jpg" alt="Using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm"/></span>, the predicted class is the class of the single neighbor nearest to the set of observed values. This special case of the k-NN algorithm<a id="id277" class="indexterm"/> is called the <a id="id278" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>nearest neighbor</strong></span> algorithm.</p><p>We can create a classifier that uses the k-NN algorithm using the <code class="literal">clj-ml</code> library's <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function. Such a classifier is specified using the keywords <code class="literal">:lazy</code> and <code class="literal">:ibk</code> as arguments to the <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function. We will now use such a classifier to model our previous example of a fish packaging plant, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(def K1-classifier (make-classifier :lazy :ibk))

<div class="section" title="Using decision trees"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec26"/>Using decision trees</h1></div></div></div><p>We can also use decision trees<a id="id282" class="indexterm"/> to model a given classification problem. A decision tree is, in fact, constructed from the given training data, and we can use this decision tree to predict the class of a given set of observed values. The process of constructing a decision tree is loosely based on the concepts of information entropy and information gain from information theory (for more information, refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>Induction of Decision Trees</em></span>). It is also often termed as <span class="strong"><strong>decision tree learning</strong></span><a id="id283" class="indexterm"/>. Unfortunately, a detailed study of information theory is beyond the scope of this book. However, in this section, we will explore some concepts in information theory that will be used in the context of machine learning.</p><p>A decision tree is a tree or graph that describes a model of decisions and their possible consequences. An internal node in a decision tree represents a decision, or rather a condition of a particular feature in the context of classification. It has two possible outcomes that are represented by the left and right subtrees of the node. Of course, a node in the decision tree could also have more than two subtrees. Each leaf node in a decision tree represents a particular class, or a consequence, in our classification model.</p><p>For example, our previous classification problem involving the fish packaging plant could have the following decision tree:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_86.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></div><p>The previously illustrated decision tree uses two conditions to classify a fish as either a salmon or a sea bass. The internal nodes represent the two conditions based on the features of our classification model. Note that the decision tree uses only two of the three features of our classification model. We can thus say the tree is <span class="emphasis"><em>pruned</em></span>. We shall briefly explore this technique as well in this section.</p><p>To classify a set of observed <a id="id284" class="indexterm"/>values using a decision tree, we traverse the tree starting from the root node until we reach a leaf node that represents the predicted class of the set of observed values. This technique of predicting the class of a set of observed values from a decision tree is always the same, irrespective of how the decision tree was constructed. For the decision tree described earlier, we can classify a fish by first comparing its length followed by the lightness of its skin. The second comparison is only needed if the length of the fish is greater than <span class="strong"><strong>6</strong></span> as specified by the internal node with the expression <span class="strong"><strong>Length &lt; 6</strong></span> in the decision tree. If the length of the fish is indeed greater than <span class="strong"><strong>6</strong></span>, we use the lightness of the skin of the fish to decide whether it's a salmon or a sea bass.</p><p>There are actually several algorithms that are used to construct a decision tree from some training data. Generally, the tree is constructed by splitting the set of sample values in the training data into smaller subsets based on an attribute value test. The process is repeated on each subset until splitting a given subset of sample values no longer adds internal nodes to the decision tree. As we mentioned earlier, it's possible for an internal node in a decision tree to have more than two subtrees.</p><p>We will now explore the <span class="strong"><strong>C4.5</strong></span> algorithm to construct a decision tree (for more information, refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning</em></span>). This algorithm uses the concept of information entropy to decide the feature and the corresponding value on which the set of sample values must be partitioned. <span class="strong"><strong>Information entropy</strong></span><a id="id285" class="indexterm"/> is defined as the measure of uncertainty in a given feature or random variable (for more information, refer to "A Mathematical Theory of Communication").</p><p>For a given feature or <a id="id286" class="indexterm"/>attribute <span class="emphasis"><em>f</em></span>, which has values within the range of <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span>, we can define the information entropy of the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_88.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></span> feature as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_89.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></div><p>In the preceding equation, the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_90.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></span> represents the number of occurrences of the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>f</em></span> with respect to the value <span class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>. Based on this definition of the information entropy of a feature, we define the normalized information gain <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_91.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></span>. In the following equality, the term <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> refers to the set of sample values or training data supplied to the algorithm:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_92.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></div><p>In terms of information entropy, the preceding definition of the information gain of a given attribute is the change in information entropy of the total set of values when the attribute <span class="emphasis"><em>f</em></span> is removed from the given set of features in the model.</p><p>The algorithm selects a feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> from the given set of features in the training data such that the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> has the maximum possible information gain in the set of features. We can represent this with the help of the following equality:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_93.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></div><p>In the preceding equation, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_94.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></span> represents the set of all the possible values that a feature <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> is known to have. The <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_95.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></span> set represents the observed values in which the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> has the value <span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span> and the term <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/4351OS_03_96.jpg" alt="Using decision trees"/></span> represents the information entropy of this set of values.</p><p>Using the preceding equation to select a feature with the maximum information gain from the training data, we can describe the C4.5 algorithm through the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">For each feature <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span>, find the normalized information gain from partitioning the sample data on the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Select the feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> with the maximum normalized information gain.</li><li class="listitem">Create an internal decision node based on the selected feature <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. Both the subtrees created from this step are either leaf nodes or a new set of sample values to be partitioned further.</li><li class="listitem">Repeat this process on each partitioned set of sample values produced from the previous step. We repeat the preceding steps until all the features in a subset of sample values have the same information entropy.</li></ol></div><p>Once a decision tree has been created,<a id="id287" class="indexterm"/> we can optionally perform <span class="strong"><strong>pruning</strong></span> on the tree. Pruning is simply the process of removing any extraneous decision nodes from the tree. This can be thought of as a form for the regularization of decision trees through which we prevent underfitting or overfitting of the estimated decision tree model.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>J48</strong></span> is an open source implementation of the C4.5 algorithm in Java, and the <code class="literal">clj-ml</code> library contains a working J48 decision tree classifier. We can create a decision tree classifier using the <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function, and we supply the keywords <code class="literal">:decision-tree</code> and <code class="literal">:c45</code> as parameters to this function to create a J48 classifier as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(def DT-classifier (make-classifier :decision-tree :c45))

Apparently, the decision tree has three distinct internal nodes. The root node of the tree is based on the width of a fish, the subsequent node is based on the length of a fish, and the last decision node is based on the lightness of the skin of a fish.</p><p>We can now use the decision tree classifier to predict the class of a fish, and we use the following <code class="literal">classifier-classify</code> function<a id="id289" class="indexterm"/> to perform this classification:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">user&gt; (classifier-classify DT-classifier sample-fish)

Another interesting option that we can specify to the <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function is the maximum number of internal nodes or folds that can be removed by pruning the decision tree. We can specify this option using the <code class="literal">:pruning-number-of-folds</code> option, and by default, the <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function imposes no such limit while pruning the decision tree. Also, we can specify that each internal decision node in the <a id="id296" class="indexterm"/>decision tree has only two subtrees by specifying the <code class="literal">:only-binary-splits</code> option to the <code class="literal">make-classifier</code> function.</p></div>
