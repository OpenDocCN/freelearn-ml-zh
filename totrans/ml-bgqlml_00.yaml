- en: '**Machine Learning** (**ML**) democratization is one of the fastest growing
    trends in the AI industry. In this field, BigQuery ML represents a fundamental
    tool for bridging the gap between data analysis and the implementation of innovative
    ML models. Through this book, you will have the opportunity to learn how to use
    BigQuery and BigQuery ML with an incremental approach that combines technical
    explanations with hands-on exercises. Following a brief introduction, you will
    immediately be able to build ML models on concrete use cases using BigQuery ML.
    By the end of this book, you will be able to choose the right ML algorithm to
    train, evaluate, and use advanced ML models.'
