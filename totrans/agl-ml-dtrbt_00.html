This chapter covers several features and functions that DataRobot provides to assist in governing and maintaining ML models.</p>
			<p><a href="B17159_14_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor199"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conclusion</em>, covers where to go for additional information and other topics that might be outside the scope of this book. We also describe where we see automated ML and DataRobot heading in the future.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>To get the most out of this book, you will need access to the DataRobot software. The commercial version has all the functionality. If you do not have access to a commercial version, you can get an evaluation version that works for a limited time and does not have all the capabilities discussed. For some of the advanced capabilities and the API to work, you will need to know some Python and have access to an open source Python environment (for instance, Anaconda or Jupyter Notebooks).</p>
