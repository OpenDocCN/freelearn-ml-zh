<p class="mce-root">Julia is a powerful programming language that is designed to enable high-performance applications with developer productivity in mind. Its dynamic nature allows you to quickly perform small-scale experiments and then migrate to larger applications. Its introspection tools allow us to optimize performance by analyzing how high-level code is translated into lower-level instructions and machine code. Its metaprogramming facility helps more advanced programmers to build custom syntax for their specific domain usage. Its multiple dispatch and generic function features make it easy to build new capabilities by extending existing functions. For these and many more reasons, Julia is an excellent tool for developing applications across a wide spectrum of industries.</p>
<p>This book fulfills several demands from Julia developers. <em>A desire to write better code. A desire to improve system performance. A desire to design software that is easy to maintain.</em> From the time that the Julia language was born to its magnificent milestone of version 1.0 in August 2018, many design patterns have already emerged from the brightest minds, ranging from the core developers of the language to heavy users of the language. At times, these patterns were presented in blog posts and conferences. Sometimes, they showed up in random discussion threads on the Julia Discourse forum. At other times, they come up in casual talks between community members on various Julia Slack channels. This book is a collection of patterns, documenting the best approaches to designing high-quality Julia applications.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this book is to organize these well-proven patterns into a format that is easily consumable by the Julia developer community. There are several benefits to organizing and naming these patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">It allows developers to communicate with each other more easily.</li>
<li class="mce-root">It allows developers to better understand code that uses these patterns.</li>
<li class="mce-root">It allows developers to articulate when a pattern should be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this book is simple but powerful – after reading this book, you should be more knowledgeable about how to design and develop software in Julia. In addition, the material presented in this book can serve as a reference for any future discussions regarding design patterns in Julia. As we know from history, new design patterns will continue to emerge alongside the continuous evolution of the Julia language.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this book. <em>Happy reading!</em></p>

<p>This book is for beginner-to-intermediate Julia developers who want to get better at writing <em>idiomatic</em> Julia code for larger applications. It is not an introductory book, so you are expected to have some basic programming knowledge. If you are familiar with the object-oriented programming paradigm, then you may find this book helpful where it shows how the same problem can be solved differently, and often in a better way, in Julia.</p>
<p>Many of the patterns described in this book are applicable to any industry domain and use cases. Whether you are a data scientist, researcher, system programmer, or enterprise application developer, you should be able to benefit from using these patterns in your projects.</p>

<p><a href="6c453014-3590-4a63-9d39-9bdd735185d5.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Designing Functions and Interfaces</em><span>, explains how functions are defined and how multiple dispatch come into play. It also discusses parametric method and interfaces, for which different functions can work with each other properly based on a pre-determined contract.</span></p>
<p><a href="ddf3571b-597d-42cc-a9b0-367318509806.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Macros and Metaprogramming Techniques</em><span>, introduces macro programming facility and how it can be used to transform source code into a different form. It describes several techniques for developing and debugging macros more effectively.</span></p>
<p><a href="962e7c27-570f-498e-89b9-d9075c58cd45.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Reusability Patterns</em><span>, covers design patterns that relate to code reuse. This includes the Delegation pattern for reusing code via composition, the Holy Traits pattern for a more formal interface contract, and the Parametric Type pattern for creating new types from a parameterized data structure.</span></p>
<p><a href="c8cedc0d-716d-46c4-8768-ae0084a10bf9.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Performance Patterns</em><span>, covers design patterns that relate to improving system performance.

The main anti-pattern is Piracy, which involves defining or extending functions for data types that you do not own. Then, it covers the Narrow Arguments and Non-Concrete Type Fields patterns, which hinder system performance.</span></p>
<p><a href="9984b03e-c2c1-4b65-8f07-6240804db32d.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Traditional Object-Oriented Patterns</em><span>, covers the traditional object-oriented patterns described in the <em>Design Patterns</em> book by Gang-of-Four. It discusses how those patterns can be simplified or implemented differently in Julia.</span></p>
<p><a href="97049a94-ad30-452a-bbb0-296d9438c886.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Inheritance and Variance</em><span>, discusses how Julia supports inheritance and why it is designed as such since its approach is quite different from mainstream object-oriented programming languages. Then, it covers the topic of type variance, an important concept in terms of subtyping relationships between data types used by multiple dispatch.</span></p>

<p>You are encouraged to run and experiment with the code samples accompanying this book. The code samples are typically stored in one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code snippets in a Julia source file. These snippets can be copied and pasted into the REPL.</li>
<li>Code residing in a package directory. The package can be instantiated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in <a href="962e7c27-570f-498e-89b9-d9075c58cd45.xhtml">Chapter 5</a><span>, </span><em>Reusability Patterns</em>, the content is listed as follows:</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text such as variable names, function names, data types, etc. For example, <span>"The </span><kbd>format</kbd><span> function takes a </span><kbd>formatter</kbd><span> and a numeric value, </span><kbd>x</kbd><span>, and returns a formatted string."</span></p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>abstract type Formatter end<br/>struct IntegerFormatter &lt;: Formatter end<br/>struct FloatFormatter &lt;: Formatter end</pre>
<p>Any experiment or output from the REPL is presented as screenshots:</p>

<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates an important word or concept. For example, "T<span>he </span><strong>Bridge pattern</strong><span> is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that it can evolve independently."</span></p>
<p><em>Italics</em>: Emphasizes a new concept that will be explained later in the text. For example, "The<span> cases presented in previous chapters include various situations that we can solve by writing </span><em>idiomatic</em><span> Julia code."</span></p>
