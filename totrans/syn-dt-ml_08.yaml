    The player usually interacts with game elements to achieve an objective. The volume,
    quality, and quantity of games released each year have grown exponentially in
    recent years. Video games are now utilized in education, training, rehabilitation,
    personal development, and just recently in **machine learning** (**ML**) research.
    Specifically, they are presented as a rich and excellent synthetic data resource
    for training and testing ML models.

    and present a clever solution for generating large-scale and automatically annotated
    datasets; refer to *Chapters 6* and *7*. However, they still have a few limitations
    due to the complexity, time, and effort required to set up the data generation
    system. Some of these limitations can be summarized in the following:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For synthetic data to be useful, most often, it needs to be photorealistic.
    However, attaining a high level of photorealism is not simple. If you recall,
    we briefly discussed these points in [*Chapter 6*](B18494_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099).
    It requires skilled engineers, artists, designers, experts in lighting and animation,
    and others to achieve this aim. In addition, the hardware to run these state-of-the-art
    game engines, the game engine itself, the tools, and the assets to build a rich
    and realistic virtual world are expensive and require extensive training. For
    example, the *Wacom Cintiq Pro 24”* costs more than £2,200 and requires months
    of training. This and similar devices are essential to create 3D content for games.
    Please refer to *Figure 8**.1*.

    generalizing from synthetic to real data. Thus, it limits the usability of the
    generated synthetic data in real-world applications.

    GANs require a considerable amount of time and effort to design and train. Additionally,
    significant computational and data storage resources are required for the training.
