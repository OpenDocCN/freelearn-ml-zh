<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The appeal of the model-centric approach is its relative simplicity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Its dominance in the field isn’t necessarily because it’s superior, but rather because it’s more straightforward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">It focuses primarily on refining models, tweaking algorithms, and enhancing computational power. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">However, this approach often neglects a fundamental aspect of ML – the quality and relevance of the data feeding </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">these models.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">The data-centric approach, on the other hand, prioritizes improving data quality over perfecting models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">It recognizes that even the most sophisticated models can falter if they’re built on a shaky foundation of poorly curated or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">irrelevant data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">The challenge you will have to lean into is that adopting a data-centric ML approach may require a significant amount </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">of effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">In this concluding chapter, we will concentrate on how you can effectively implement the knowledge you’ve accumulated throughout this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">We will cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Let’s start by looking at how a data-centric approach provides the tools to remove common bottlenecks in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">ML development.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Solving six common ML challenges</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">We have </span><a id="_idIndexMarker831"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">written this book to provide you with the tools and techniques </span><a id="_idIndexMarker832"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">required to overcome six common challenges that typically become bottlenecks in the development of ML models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">These six challenges are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">as follows:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The typical development approach is model-centric</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">: In traditional ML, the focus is primarily on the model – choosing the right algorithm, tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing performance metrics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">This model-centric approach often involves countless iterations of tweaking the model to squeeze out a bit more accuracy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">However, while models are undoubtedly important, this approach can sometimes lead to overlooking other equally crucial aspects, such as the quality and relevancy of the data feeding </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">these models.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">The potential of any ML model is capped by data quality and quantity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">: No matter how sophisticated an ML model is, its performance is ultimately determined by the quality and quantity of the data it is trained on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate predictions, while insufficient data may result in overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">unseen data.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">We can’t always just “get more data”</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">: While having more data can help improve model performance, obtaining additional data isn’t always feasible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">It may be expensive, time-consuming, or even impossible due to privacy concerns or the rarity of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">certain events.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Most data is not collected and curated for ML purposes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">: Data is often collected for a variety of reasons, such as reporting, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">business intelligence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">BI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">), or record-keeping, but not specifically for ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">This can result in data that is irrelevant, incomplete, or noisy for our specific </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">ML task.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">SMEs and annotators don’t know the end goal of data collection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">: In many cases, those collecting or annotating the data are not fully aware of the end goal of the ML project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">This lack of understanding can lead to inconsistencies in data annotation or collection, as different people might interpret </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">instructions differently.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">SMEs and annotators are biased</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">: Everyone has biases, and SMEs and annotators are no exception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">These biases can inadvertently influence how they collect or annotate data, leading to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">skewed datasets.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">To solve these</span><a id="_idIndexMarker833"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> six challenges, or bottlenecks, we presented you with four principles of data-centric ML (in </span><a href="B19297_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">, Principles of Data-Centric ML</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">) and a data-centric ML toolkit consisting of a range of technical and non-technical tools </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">and approaches.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">However, knowledge is only useful when it is applied. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">As we draw a close to our exploration of data-centric ML, it is time for you to reflect on what you will have to do differently to apply what you have learned in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">this book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Inevitably, you will have to change some of your own approaches and habits and reshape some of the interactions you have with your colleagues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">As we have mentioned many times over, data science is a team sport, and it is time for you to become the captain of the team playing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">data-centric ML.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">To successfully navigate this role, there are three key areas where you need </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">to focus:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Being a champion for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">data quality</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Let’s go through each of these areas </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">in detail.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Being a champion for data quality</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">The cornerstone</span><a id="_idIndexMarker834"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1"> of any successful data-centric ML initiative is high-quality data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">As an expert in this space, it’s your responsibility to advocate for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker835"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">and maintain rigorous data quality standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">This involves ensuring that data collection, cleaning, and annotation processes are robust and consistent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">However, it may sometimes feel like the universe is against you, continuously supplying you with poor data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">That’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">probably true!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">The second law of thermodynamics states that energy tends to spread out and systems naturally progress toward disorder or increase in “entropy” if not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">actively managed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">This phenomenon also plays out in pretty much every ordered system you can think of, including business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">At its core, a business is a collection of people, technologies, and processes systematically organized toward a set of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">common goals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">But as time goes on, people will move in and out of the business, technology stacks grow in size and complexity, and processes become redundant or superseded by people’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">personal interests.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Let’s apply this concept to a business scenario where an organization’s technology stack grows over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">As the tech stack expands, adding more software, platforms, and infrastructure, it’s like adding more energy to the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">Without proper management and organization, this can lead to increased complexity and “disorder.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.4">Systems may not interact efficiently, there might be redundancies, or critical processes could fall through the cracks – this is the “entropy” in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">our scenario.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">We see this scenario play out in every organization we interact with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">Even though any organization would have started from zero, the typical medium- to large-sized corporation will have hundreds, if not thousands, of technology applications running at any given time, generating an increasingly complex web </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">of data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">A 2022 survey of more than 200 IT and data professionals at North American organizations with at least 1,000 employees confirms this</span><span class="superscript"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">1</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">The survey found that these organizations manage data from an average of 400 sources, with 20% of respondents pulling data from 1,000 or more sources to feed their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">analytics systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">In other</span><a id="_idIndexMarker836"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1"> words, data disorder is not a random occurrence, but the default outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">Unless lots of effort is put into keeping things in order, chaotic data </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> ensue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">As a data professional, it is your job to identify and reverse this data entropy, with help from the rest of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">If you don’t, your job will become harder, not easier, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">over time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">To manage and reverse data entropy, you first need to measure it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">There are several sophisticated tools available in the marketplace for this purpose, but if your organization isn’t able and willing to invest in these, then start championing data quality using simple data quality measures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">If your organization doesn’t have effective data quality measurement protocols in place, you can be the one to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">inspire action.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Championing data quality means showing others how it’s done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">In this book, we have given you the tools you need to take a data-centric approach to ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">Now, it’s your turn to inspire your colleagues by showing them the potential of this approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.4">Be generous in sharing the knowledge you’ve gained throughout </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">this book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Championing data quality also means creating an environment where data accuracy is valued and prioritized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">Encourage your team to never make assumptions about the state of the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">By doing so, you’ll be laying the groundwork for reliable, accurate, and effective </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">ML models.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">And to do this, you need to bring people together from across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">the business.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Bringing people together</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker837"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">science is, at its core, a collaborative discipline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">It requires the input and expertise of individuals from various backgrounds and skill sets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">As the expert at the center of any ML project, one of your primary roles is to facilitate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">this collaboration.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Here is the challenge: most data scientists are curious, technically gifted, autonomous, and highly intelligent systematic thinkers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">We like to solve complex problems, and we like to solve them </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">on our own</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">We like working in solitude. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">We revel in detail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">We are used to people asking </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">us</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1"> for help, not the other way around. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">We are problem solvers, not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">problem creators.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">For people</span><a id="_idIndexMarker838"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> with these behavioral traits, it can be really tough to bring people together and manage the inevitable interpersonal complexities that emerge from group dynamics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">It can take a lot of energy and push us beyond what we’re comfortable with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">Out of everything we’ve covered in this book, learning to bring people together might be the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">hardest part.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">At the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker839"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1"> same time, our stakeholders typically don’t have a deep technical understanding of ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">They’re probably not even interested in how it all works – they just want the business outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">They want to see results, not data quality issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">This is a tough crowd </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">to inspire.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">It’s not easy to foster an environment where open communication, idea sharing, and constructive feedback are the norm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">It’s not easy to break down silos and encourage cross-functional collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">But that is what it takes if you want to maximize your chances of building impactful ML solutions that make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">a difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">You get non-technical stakeholders excited about data quality by linking it to a business problem, not by describing the technical intricacies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">This requires you to understand the business, more than it requires business stakeholders to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">understand data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Therefore, we encourage you to step outside your comfort zone and do your very best to make data science a team sport, even if it is really difficult and feels uncomfortable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">It will be very rewarding when you succeed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Remember – the most innovative solutions often come from diverse teams that bring together different perspectives </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">and approaches.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Finally, adopting a data-centric approach extends beyond merely optimizing ML performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">It also involves the important responsibility of using data ethically </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">and fairly.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">Taking accountability for AI ethics and fairness</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">As the use </span><a id="_idIndexMarker840"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">of ML and AI continues to grow, so does the importance of ethics and fairness in these technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">As an expert in this field, it’s your responsibility to ensure that the data you build models on is as fair and unbiased </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">as possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">ML is an act of creation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">It’s a process that shapes the world around us, influencing how we interact with products, services, and even each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.3">ML models have the power to shape behaviors, mold perceptions, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">establish norms.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">This means being proactive in identifying potential sources of bias and taking steps to mitigate them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">It also means being transparent about how models are built and used, and being accountable for their outcomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">By owning this responsibility, you’ll be helping to build trust in ML systems and ensuring that they are used in a way that is fair and beneficial </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">for all.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Making data everyone’s business – our own experience</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">A few years ago, I (Jonas) took over the leadership of a highly skilled team that included data engineers, BI developers, data analysts, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">data scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Although </span><a id="_idIndexMarker843"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">this was a very competent team with a solid understanding of their business, they struggled to live up to their full potential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">I quickly identified the team’s number one challenge: stakeholders from across the organization were inundating the team with basic data requests that kept everyone very busy but were not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">particularly impactful.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">In short, stakeholders were accustomed to requesting raw or minimally curated data so that they could find their own insights, and the team was conditioned to reluctantly accept this as the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">modus operandi.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">The scattered use of data and analytics showed that the organization hadn’t grasped the importance of data quality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">They were also missing out on greatly boosting business performance by using advanced analytics in a more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">organized way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">We</span><a id="_idIndexMarker844"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1"> wanted to flip this situation around so that we could establish a more structured, streamlined approach to data usage and analytics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Our goal was to emphasize the importance of data quality and its potential to drive enhanced business performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">We aimed to change the approach from self-service raw data to providing valuable insights through well-curated, advanced analytics, thus transforming the modus operandi from a reactive to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">proactive one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">We had three areas </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">of focus:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">We wanted to open people’s eyes to the importance of data quality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">Our definition of success was seeing key business stakeholders turn into self-nominated data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">quality champions.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">We wanted to deliver advanced data products that created enduring business value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">Our definition of success was seeing our team and business stakeholders coming together to define, build, and use data-driven business tools </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">and products.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">We wanted data to be an asset for the company and its customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">Our definition of success was that data-driven solutions delivered by the team were creating enduring value for customers and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">employees alike.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">We started by holding companywide education sessions on the importance of data quality and the potential to improve business performance with ML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">People were nodding their heads in agreement and commending the team for making this complex information digestible by a layman’s audience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">But we didn’t see the behavior change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">we wanted.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">The influx of basic requests amplified as our stakeholders had now been inspired to use data to inform their decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">The team got busier than ever, trying to make the best of these poorly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">designed requests.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">We quickly decided to change our approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">Firstly, we introduced a requirement for a business case to be established before we committed to any new piece of work that would take more than half a day </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">to complete.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">Secondly, we conducted a series of workshops with senior stakeholders to identify and rank the company’s biggest pain points that could be solved through better provision of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">advanced analytics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">From these workshops came three major projects that involved stakeholders from across the organization: the provision of a new portfolio management system for customer-facing staff, a task management system for back-office staff, and a process automation project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">All three projects relied on rules-based and ML algorithms and required an increased focus on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">data quality.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker845"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">projects relied on business stakeholders taking charge of data quality and creating processes that would ensure data quality always met our standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">Our team collaborated closely with business stakeholders to make sure there was always a clear link between business problems and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">data capture.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">To our great excitement, it didn’t take long before meeting agendas around the company included data quality issues and initiatives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">Our senior stakeholders had taken on the role of championing data quality and were holding their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">teams accountable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">Each of the three projects was a resounding success, producing robust data products while simultaneously enhancing cross-functional collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">These projects generated a shift toward data-driven decision-making and reinforced the perception of data as a strategic asset across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">the company.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">This significant transformation was only possible because the data professionals on my team bravely stepped outside their comfort zones to make data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">everybody’s business.</span></span></p>
