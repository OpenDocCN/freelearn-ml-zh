    improving decision-making is not the algorithm, but the softer, more qualitative
    skills of communication and influence. The problem many of us have with this is
    that it is hard to quantify how effective one is around these skills. It is probably
    safe to say that many of us ended up in this position because of a desire to avoid
    it. After all, the highly successful TV comedy *The Big Bang Theory* was built
    on this premise. Therefore, the goal of this chapter is to set you up for success.
    The intent is to provide a process, a flexible process no less, where you can
    become a **change agent**: a person who can influence and turn their insights
    into action without positional power. We will focus on **Cross-Industry Standard
    Process for Data Mining** (**CRISP-DM**). It is probably the most well-known and
    respected of all processes for analytical projects. Even if you use another industry
    process or something proprietary, there should still be a few gems in this chapter

    the problem. An effective question to ask is, "What are we going to do different?"
    This may seem like a benign question, but it can really challenge people to work
    out what they need from an analytical perspective and it can get to the root of
    the decision that needs to be made. It can also prevent you from going out and
    doing a lot of unnecessary work on some kind of "fishing expedition." As such,
    the key for you is to identify the decision. A working definition of a decision
    can be put forward to the team as the irrevocable choice to commit or not commit
    the resources. Additionally, remember that the choice to do nothing different
    is indeed a decision.
  prefs: []

    not absolutely clear. There will be times when the problem is not, or cannot be,
    well defined; to paraphrase former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, there are
    known-unknowns. Indeed, there will probably be many times when the problem is
    ill defined and the project's main goal is to further the understanding of the
    problem and generate hypotheses; again calling on Secretary Rumsfeld, unknown-unknowns,
    which means that you don't know what you don't know. However, with ill-defined
    problems, one could go forward with an understanding of what will happen next
    in terms of resource commitment based on the various outcomes from hypothesis
    exploration.

    not neglect to scour the records of past and current projects. Odds are someone
    in the organization has worked, or is working on the same problem and it may be
    essential to synchronize your work with theirs. Don't forget to enumerate the
    risks considering **time**, **people**, and **money**. Do everything in your power
    to create a list of stakeholders, both those that impact your project and those
    that could be impacted by your project. Identify who these people are and how
    they can influence/be impacted by the decision. Once this is done, work with the
