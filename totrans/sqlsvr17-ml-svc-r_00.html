Using simple examples showing that R Services can also be useful for other roles involved in SQL Server, this chapter shows how R Services integrated in SQL Server enables DBAs to be more empowered by evolving their rudimentary monitoring activities into more useful actionable predictions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0158.html#4MLOS0-e3f81285367248f4bbc6431bcd4f926d" class="calibre10">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre12">R and SQL Server 2016/2017 Features Extended</em>, covers how new features of SQL Server 2016 and 2017 and R services can be used together, such as taking advantage of the new JSON format with the R language, using new improvements to the in-memory OLTP technology to deliver almost real-time analytics, combining new features in Column store index and R, and how to get the most out of them. It also considers how to leverage PolyBase and Stretch DB to reach beyond on-premises to hybrid and cloud possibilities. Lastly, the query store holds many statistics from execution plans, and R is a perfect tool to perform deeper analysis.</p>
