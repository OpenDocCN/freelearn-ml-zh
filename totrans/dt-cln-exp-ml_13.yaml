- en: There are a good number of high performing algorithms for predicting categorical
    targets. We will examine the most popular classification algorithms in this part.
    We will also consider why we might choose one algorithm over any of the others
    given the attributes our data and our domain knowledge.

- en: We are as concerned with underfitting and overfitting with classification models
    as we were with regression models in the previous part. When the relationship
    between features and the target is complicated, we need to use an algorithm that
    can capture that complexity. But there is often a non-trivial risk of overfitting.
    We will discuss strategies for modeling complexity without overfitting in the
    chapters in this part. This usually involves some form of regularization for logistic
    regression models, limits on tree depth for decision trees, and adjusting the
    tolerance for margin violations with support vector classification.

- en: If we are trying to model complexity without overfitting we have to be prepared
    to spend a good chunk of time doing hyperparameter tuning. We will definitely
    spend a fair bit of time on that in these chapters. Related to that, we also get
    really good at cross validation and generating and interpreting evaluation metrics.
    We will discuss accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity in each of the
    next five chapters. We will also get very used to staring at a confusion matrix.

- en: We will also examine how these algorithms can be extended to multiclass targets.
    This is straightforward with k-nearest neighbors and decision tress, but requires
    extension to the algorithm for logistic regression and support vector regression.
    We go over that in these chapters.
