Before they were adopted into data science and placed into the syllabi of numerous boot camps and in the early chapters of many practical how-to-do books, they have been a prominent and relevant element of the body of knowledge of statistics, economics, and of many other respectable quantitative fields of study.</p><p class="calibre8">Consequently, there is a vast availability of monographs, book chapters, and papers about linear regression, logistic regression (its classification variant), and the different types of generalized linear models; models where the original linear regression paradigm is adapted in its formulation in order to solve more complex problems.</p><p class="calibre8">Yet, in spite of such an embarrassment of riches, we have never encountered any book that really explains the speed and ease of implementation of such linear models when, as a developer or a data scientist, you have to quickly create an application or API whose response cannot be defined programmatically but it does have to learn from data.</p><p class="calibre8">Of course we are very well aware of the limitations of linear models (being simple unfortunately has some drawbacks) and we also know how there is no fixed solution for any data science problem; however, our experience in the field has told us that the following advantages of a linear model cannot be easily ignored:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">It's easy to explain how it works to yourself, to the management, or to anyone</li><li class="listitem">It's flexible in respect of your data problem, since it can handle numeric and probability estimates, ranking, and classification up to a large number of classes</li><li class="listitem">It's fast to train, no matter what the amount of data you have to process</li><li class="listitem">It's fast and easy to implement in any production environment</li><li class="listitem">It's scalable to real-time response toward users</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">If for you, as it is daily for us, it is paramount to deliver value from data in a fast and tangible way, just follow us and discover how far linear model can help you get to.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre17" id="calibre_pb_1"/>

Then, you will learn how to tune the model for higher performances and understand every parameter of it, deeply. Finally, the engine under the hood the gradient descent will be described.</p><p class="calibre8"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. Multiple Regression in Action" href="part0023_split_000.html#LTSU2-a2faae6898414df7b4ff4c9a487a20c6">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="strong"><em class="calibre9"> Multiple Regression in Action</em></span>, extends the simple linear regression to extract predictive information from more than a feature and create models that can solve real-life prediction tasks. The stochastic gradient descent technique, explained in the previous chapter, will be powered up to cope with a matrix of features and to complete the overview, you will be shown multi-collinearity, interactions, and polynomial regression topics.</p><p class="calibre8"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. Logistic Regression" href="part0029_split_000.html#RL0A2-a2faae6898414df7b4ff4c9a487a20c6">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Logistic Regression,</em></span> continues laying down the foundations of your knowledge of linear model.

Without getting too deep into their mathematical formulation, but always keeping an eye on practical applications, we will discuss the ideas underneath Least Angle Regression, Bayesian Regression, and stochastic gradient descent with hinge loss, and also touch upon bagging and boosting techniques.</p><p class="calibre8"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 9. Real-world Applications for Regression Models" href="part0056_split_000.html#1LCVG1-a2faae6898414df7b4ff4c9a487a20c6">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Real-world Applications for Regression Models,</em></span> comprises of four practical examples of real-world data science problems solved by linear models.

Though the book doesn't require a previous background in data science or statistics, it can well address data scientists of any seniority who intend to learn how to best do regression analysis on a dataset. We imagine that you want to put intelligence in your data products but you don't want to depend on any black box. Therefore, you prefer a technique which is simple, understandable, and yet effective to be production grade. Through the book, we will provide you with the knowledge to use Python for building fast and better linear models and to deploy the resulting models in Python or in any computer language you prefer.</p></div>
