<p><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought; and that</span></em> <em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.</span></em><br/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many people who we are grateful to because their support, help, knowledge, and advice were instrumental in shaping this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First of all, we would like to thank Tomás Fernández Marcos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He taught both of us — albeit in different millennia! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">— some of the mathematical notions that, in our future, would be indispensable for our study of quantum computing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, he introduced us to each other, because he had the prescient intuition that we would share many interesting projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is fair to say that, without him, this book would not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We would also like to thank Alberto Di Meglio for writing such a wonderful foreword for us. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rest of the book can only go downhill from there!</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many parts of this book originate from courses on quantum computing taught over the years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Those courses would not have been possible without the help and trust of Enrique Arias, Alberto Di Meglio, Melissa Gaillard, Ester Martín Garzón and José Ranilla, among others.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We are also indebted to all the colleagues with whom we have discussed different topics on quantum computing and from whom we have learned a lot. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We are particularly grateful to those who gave us very useful feedback and comments on preliminary versions of our lectures and of material for this book, including Vasilis Belis, Héctor García Morales, Miguel Hernández-Cáceres, Carla Rieger, Ignacio F. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rúa, Bruno Santidrián Manzanedo, Daniel Setó, Erik Skibinsky Gitlin, and Sofia Vallecorsa. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also want to give heartfelt thanks to Ferdous Khan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was the first to suggest that our lectures should be collected in book form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We cannot overstate how much we appreciate his constant encouragement and support.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, we would also like to thank our team at Packt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They believed in our ability to write a whole book on quantum computing much more than we did ourselves! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And they provided many useful suggestions and advice, making the complicated process of preparing a technical manuscript as smooth as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We’ve been extremely lucky to have such wonderful technical reviewers as Guillermo Botella and Francisco Orts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They went well beyond the call of duty to check that everything was correct, they gave us invaluable feedback and suggestions, and they located quite a number of errata and typos that would have been very embarrassing had they made it to the print version. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obviously, all remaining errors are our sole responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And last but certainly not least, we would like to thank our friends and families. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Writing a book takes a lot of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And when we say ”a lot,” we really mean ”an incredibly awful lot.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sadly, we had to steal part of that time from them and, moreover, they had to listen to our complaints and worries when we went through rough spots in the writing process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If it weren’t for them, we could not have made it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is all because of them and dedicated to them.</span></p>
