- en: For data scientists and machine learning engineers, notebooks are a fundamental
    productivity tool. Notebooks allow us to interact with computing resources because
    we can use them to write and execute code, visualize the results, and share the
    outcomes with other data scientists. Data engineers, data scientists, and machine
    learning engineers make experiments and explore data before deploying code into
    the production environment. They leverage notebooks because they offer a flexible
    and agile environment to develop and test in.
