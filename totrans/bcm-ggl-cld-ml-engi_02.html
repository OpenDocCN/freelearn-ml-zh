<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Mastering Python Programming</h1>
<p>Before we train a machine to learn, we need to teach it a language. Computers are very good at binary code since they were created to operate in zeros and ones. Human beings have invented a language compiler to compile a high-level language (such as Python) program into binary code so that a computer can run it. Python is a high-level language that is intuitive – it has a simplified syntax very similar to natural language. Python is widely used in solving problems using computer programming, especially in <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>).</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will start with a simple mathematical problem and show how Python can solve it directly and concisely. Understanding the solution will help us understand the Python basics, including variables, data structures, conditions, and controls. Then, we will cover Python’s data processing packages, including NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. </p>
<p>Python is a programming language and practicing is a big portion of mastering the language. In <a href="B18333_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184"><em class="italic">Appendix 1</em></a> of this book, we have provided a step-by-step guide to using Python data processing packages. Practicing these steps is essential to mastering Python skills.</p>
<p>In the chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basics of Python</li>
<li>Python data libraries and packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we begin, let’s take a look at the prerequisites for this chapter.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>To follow the instructions in this chapter, make sure that you have set up Google Colab, a product from Google Research that allows programmers to write and execute Python code through a browser (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com">https://colab.research.google.com</a>). Colab is well suited to ML and data analysis, and we will use it to run basic Python code in this chapter. Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>The basics of Python</h1>
<p>We will cover the basics<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> of Python programming by starting with a simple egg-counting problem.</p>
<p>There are less than 2,000 eggs in a big basket. Let’s say that we take the eggs out in groups of two each time so that one egg is left in the basket at the end. Here, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a group of 3 is used, 0 are left.</li>
<li>If a group of 4 is used, 1 is left.</li>
<li>If a group of 5 is used, 4 are left.</li>
<li>If a group of 6 is used, 3 are left.</li>
<li>If a group of 7 is used, 0 are left.</li>
<li>If a group of 8 is used, 1 is left.</li>
<li>If a group of 9 is used, 0 are left.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how many eggs are in the bucket?</p>
<p>Let’s look at a solution to this problem using Python programming:</p>
<pre class="source-code">for i in range (1, 2001, 2):
      if ( ((i % 3) == 0) and ((i % 4) == 1) and ((i % 5) == 4) and ((i % 6) == 3) and ((i % 7) == 0) and ((i % 8) == 1) and  ((i % 9) == 0) ):
      print("Total number of eggs in the bucket can be %d" %i)</pre>
<p>As you can see, we tell the computer to try each odd number (why?) between 1 and 2,000 and test it against all the conditions specified in the problem. If, for a certain number, all the conditions are met, then we print out the number. When all the odd numbers are examined, the numbers that meet the conditions are printed out. That’s neat!</p>
<p>Executing the preceding program on Colab yields the following output:</p>
<pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">Total number of eggs in the bucket can be 1449</strong></pre>
<p>If we examine the Python program more closely, we can observe the following: we use <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> as a variable that is assigned an odd number at a time, between <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">2000</strong>, and we use a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> clause to construct a loop that repeatedly checks if the value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> satisfies the conditions (the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> clause) and print the value if it does. The variables and their operations, the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> clause, and the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> clause are the basics of Python. Next, we will examine these basic <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>concepts in Python.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Basic Python variables and operations</h2>
<p>Programming <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>languages use variables. A Python variable is a reserved memory location in a computer that stores values – that is, a variable in a Python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a data type. The action of placing data in a variable is<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> called <strong class="bold">assignment</strong>. The action of calling a variable after it is created is<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> called <strong class="bold">using the variable</strong>. </p>
<p>For example, the following actions are <em class="italic">assignments</em>:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer017">
<img alt="Table 2.1 – Python variable assignments " height="347" src="image/Table_2.1.jpg" width="1407"/>
</div>

<p>The following actions are <em class="italic">using variables</em>:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.2 – Python using variables</p>
<p>To further understand the variables’ data types and their operations, let’s run some small Python code snippets using Colab:</p>
<pre class="source-code">x = int(2.8)        
print(x) 
<strong class="bold">2 </strong>
z = str(3.0)    
z = float(z) 
z = int(z/2)       
z = z * 4.5
print(z)
<strong class="bold">4.5</strong>
z = z ** x
print (z)
<strong class="bold">20.25</strong>
y = float("3")     
a = (x==y)
print (a)
<strong class="bold">False</strong>
b = ((z==z) and (a != x))
print (b)
<strong class="bold">True</strong></pre>
<p>Please take a <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>moment here and make sure you understand how the preceding code snippet was executed to get the results.</p>
<p>For Python variables, we can operate on them using mathematical operations. The following table lists the arithmetic operations for Python variables:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.5 – Python logical operations</p>
<p>Now that we’ve introduced Python variables and their basic operations, let’s look at Python’s basic <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>data structures and control operations. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Basic Python data structure</h2>
<p>Python<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> has five basic data types: </p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Tuples </li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we’ve already covered numbers and strings, we will cover <strong class="bold">lists</strong>, <strong class="bold">tuples</strong>, and <strong class="bold">dictionaries</strong> here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong class="bold">list</strong> is an ordered<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> collection of values. The values in the list are called elements, or items. A list can contain zero or more items and is a collection that maintains the order of its items. Lists are written in brackets, <strong class="source-inline">[ ]</strong>. The following is an example:<p class="source-code">ints = [10, 20, 30, 40]</p><p class="source-code">words = ["flower", "soil", "water"]</p><p class="source-code">mix = ["flower", -3.2, True, 6]  </p><p class="source-code">empty_list = []</p><p class="source-code">floats = [4.7, -6.0, 0.22, 1.6]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The basic operations <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>of lists are shown in the following table:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer022">
<img alt="Table 2.6 – Python list operations  " height="356" src="image/Table_2.6.jpg" width="1336"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.6 – Python list operations </p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong class="bold">tuple</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>collection of Python objects separated by commas. Like a list, a tuple has an index and allows nested objects. Unlike a list, which is mutable, a tuple is immutable. Tuples are written in round brackets, <strong class="source-inline">()</strong>. The following is an example: <p class="source-code">coordinates = (1, 2, 3)</p></li>
<li>A <strong class="bold">dictionary</strong> is a Python<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> container that stores mappings of unique keys to their values. Unlike a set, a dictionary is unordered. Like a list, a dictionary is mutable. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>, and the key-value pairs inside a dictionary are separated by commas (<strong class="source-inline">,</strong>). Each key is separated from its value by a colon (<strong class="source-inline">:</strong>). The<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> following is an example:<p class="source-code">person = {'name': 'Lini', 'year': 1989, 'expertise': 'data analytics'}</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Python conditions and loops </h2>
<p>Python <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>programs need to make decisions based on conditions, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">if</strong> (condition) <strong class="bold">else</strong> (action)</li>
<li><strong class="bold">while</strong> (condition) <strong class="bold">do</strong> (action loop) </li>
<li><strong class="bold">for</strong> (condition)  <strong class="bold">do</strong> (action loop)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you saw in the egg-counting program, it contains a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements:</p>
<pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">for i</strong> in range (1, 2001, 2):
    <strong class="bold">if</strong> ( ((i %for  3) == 0) and ((i % 4) == 1) and ((i % 5) == 4) and ((i % 6) == 3) and ((i % 7) == 0) and ((i % 8) == 1) and  ((i % 9) == 0) ):
    print («Total number of eggs is %d» %i)</pre>
<p>With the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, the problem was solved. These control statements <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>manage how the logic flows in Python programs. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Python functions </h2>
<p>Python functions <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>have two parts in a program: the <strong class="bold">function definition</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> the <strong class="bold">function call</strong>. First, a function is defined, and then the function that was defined is called. Let’s look at an example to explain function definition and calling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Problem</strong>: Find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Solution</strong>: Use Python functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how function definition and calling are used to solve the given problem:</p>
<ol>
<li><em class="italic">Function 1</em> takes in a number and checks if it’s a prime number:<p class="source-code">def Prime(Number):</p><p class="source-code">for i in range(2, (int(math.sqrt(Number))+1)):</p><p class="source-code">           if(Number % i == 0):</p><p class="source-code">                  return 0</p><p class="source-code">           else:</p><p class="source-code">                  continue</p><p class="source-code">           return 1</p></li>
<li><em class="italic">Function 2</em> finds and returns all the prime numbers between the <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">b</strong> integers. For each integer between <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">b</strong>, it checks if it’s a prime number by calling <em class="italic">Function 1</em>. If it is, then it adds it to a list. In the end, the list is returned:<p class="source-code">def PNlist(a,b):</p><p class="source-code">           list=[]</p><p class="source-code">          for Number in range (a, b):</p><p class="source-code">             if (Prime(Number)==1):</p><p class="source-code">                 list.append(Number)</p><p class="source-code">          return list</p></li>
<li>The <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> program finds and returns all the prime numbers between <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>:<p class="source-code">list1=PNlist(1,100)</p><p class="source-code">print(list1)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, when the computer executes the main program, it will call <em class="italic">Function 2</em>, <strong class="source-inline">PNlist(1,100)</strong>, to examine the numbers between <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>: for each number, it will call <em class="italic">Function 1</em>, <strong class="source-inline">Prime(number)</strong>, to see if it is a prime number or not – if it is, it’s put into the<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> list. Finally, the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> program prints the list of prime numbers.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Opening and closing files in Python</h2>
<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>Python code opens an input file and reads it from user inputs:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Open a file named <strong class="source-inline">“lifeguards.in”</strong> for reading only.</li>
<li>Read a line in the file.</li>
<li>Convert the text read into integers:<p class="source-code"> f1=open("lifeguards.in", "r")</p><p class="source-code"> n1=f1.readline()</p><p class="source-code"> n=int(n1)</p><p class="source-code"> f1.close</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following Python code block calculates the answer, writes it to the output file, and closes the file:</p>
<p class="source-code">  answer=n*(n+1)/2</p>
<p class="source-code">  f2=open("lifeguards.out", "w")</p>
<p class="source-code">  f2.write(str(answer))</p>
<p class="source-code">  f2.close</p>
<p>Now that we have gone over the basics of Python, let’s solve an interesting problem using the<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> knowledge and skills we have learned so far.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>An interesting problem</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll use<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> the basic Python knowledge and skills we have learned so far to solve the USA Computer Olympiad problem (source: <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=784">http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=784</a>).</p>
<p>Farmer John has opened a swimming pool and hired <em class="italic">N</em> cows as lifeguards, each of which has a shift that covers some contiguous interval of time during the day. For simplicity, the pool is open from time <strong class="source-inline">t=0</strong> until time <strong class="source-inline">t=1000</strong> daily, and each shift can be described by two integers – the starting and ending time. For example, a lifeguard starting at time <strong class="source-inline">t=4</strong> and ending at time <strong class="source-inline">t=7</strong> covers three time units. Unfortunately, John is over budgeted and must fire exactly one lifeguard. What is the maximum amount of time that can still be covered by the shifts of the remaining lifeguards? An interval of time is covered if at least one lifeguard is present. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Input</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first line of input contains <em class="italic">N (1≤N≤100)</em>. Each of the next <em class="italic">N</em> lines describes a lifeguard in terms of two integers between <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">1000</strong> to provide the start/end point of a lifeguard’s shift. All such endpoints are distinct. The shifts of different lifeguards may overlap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Output</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Write a single number that specifies the maximum amount of time that can still be covered if Farmer John fires <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> lifeguard:</p>
<p class="source-code">SAMPLE INPUT:</p>
<p class="source-code">3</p>
<p class="source-code">5 9</p>
<p class="source-code">1 4</p>
<p class="source-code">3 7</p>
<p class="source-code">SAMPLE OUTPUT:</p>
<p class="source-code">7</p>
<p>Let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>at the following diagram to understand the problem:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer023">
<img alt="Figure 2.7 – Understanding the sample inputs and output " height="600" src="image/Figure_2.1.jpg" width="1445"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Understanding the sample inputs and output</p>
<p>The preceding diagram shows the sample inputs and output. Here, we can see that there are three guards and that their time coverages are 5-9, 1-4, and 3-7, respectively. If we remove the first guard, the remaining coverage will be 1-7, which is 6. If we remove the second guard, the remaining coverage will be 3-9, which equals 6. If we remove the third guard, the remaining coverage will be 1-4 and 5-9, which equals 7. So, the maximum coverage when removing one guard at a time is <em class="italic">max(6,6,7)=7</em>.</p>
<p>Understanding this sample helps us think about the solution. We need to find out what the largest coverage is by comparing the remaining coverage after removing one guard at a time. The simplest way to do this is by using brute-force and Python lists. The following is a solution using Python:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Claim/initialize the variable and arrays:<p class="source-code">start=[0 for i in range(1001)]</p><p class="source-code">end=[0 for i in range(1001)]</p><p class="source-code">cover=[0 for i in range(1001)]</p><p class="source-code">cover1=[0 for i in range(1001)]</p></li>
<li>Open the<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> input file and read the input data:<p class="source-code">f1 = open("lifeguards.in", "r")</p><p class="source-code">n=f1.readline()</p><p class="source-code">n=int(n)</p></li>
<li>Read the data and assign it to variables (<strong class="source-inline">start[i]</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">end[i]</strong> are the start/end time for guard <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>):<p class="source-code">for i in range(1, n+1):</p><p class="source-code">  a,b=f1.readline().split()</p><p class="source-code">  a=int(a)</p><p class="source-code">  b=int(b)</p><p class="source-code">  start[i]=a</p><p class="source-code">  end[i]=b</p></li>
<li>Use a new list to record the total guard coverage at time <strong class="source-inline">j</strong>:<p class="source-code"> for j in range (a, b):</p><p class="source-code">     cover[j] += 1</p><p class="source-code"> f1.close()</p></li>
<li>Remove one guard at a time, compare the maximum coverages, and get the maximum:<p class="source-code">answer=0</p><p class="source-code">for i in range (1, n+1):</p><p class="source-code">     for j in range (1, 1000):</p><p class="source-code">     cover1[j]=cover[j]</p><p class="source-code">     max = 0</p><p class="source-code">     for j in range (int(start[i]), int(end[i])):</p><p class="source-code">      cover1[j] -= 1</p><p class="source-code"> for k in range (1, 1000):</p><p class="source-code">          if (cover1[k] &gt; 0): max=max+1</p><p class="source-code">      if (answer &lt; max):</p><p class="source-code">      answer = max</p></li>
<li>Open the output file, write the output data in it, and close the file:<p class="source-code">f2 = open("lifeguards.out", "w")</p><p class="source-code">f2.write(str(answer))</p><p class="source-code">F2.close()</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While there are <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>many solutions to this problem, this solution shows a simple and logical way to tackle the problem. It helps Python beginners follow and learn the problem-solving logic and skills that are required.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Python data libraries and packages</h1>
<p>As we mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> earlier, Python has five standard data types: numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Using these data structures, Python can handle many tasks. To extend its ability for data manipulation and visualization, Python libraries and packages are created. We will briefly introduce four libraries: <strong class="bold">NumPy</strong>, <strong class="bold">Pandas</strong>, <strong class="bold">Matplotlib</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Seaborn</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>NumPy </h2>
<p>NumPy is<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> short <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>for <strong class="bold">Numerical Python</strong>. It is a fundamental library in Python and is a general-purpose array-processing package. NumPy is very good at basic and advanced array operations. It is used to process arrays that store values of the same data type. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Pandas </h2>
<p><strong class="source-inline">Pandas</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>considered the most powerful and<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> flexible open source data analysis and manipulation tool available. It is a Python library that’s been optimized for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating multidimensional arrays of data. Pandas contains the Series and DataFrame data structures. The Series data structure is for storing a 1D array (or vector) of data elements, whereas a DataFrame is a Pandas data structure for storing and manipulating 2D arrays. In practice, we often think of it as an Excel spreadsheet. Pandas also has a robust set of plotting functions that we will also use for dataset visualizing. The plotting features of Pandas can be found in the <strong class="source-inline">plotting</strong> module.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Matplotlib </h2>
<p>Matplotlib is a <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>graphics package for data <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>visualization in Python. It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy, and it is well integrated with NumPy and Pandas. </p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Seaborn </h2>
<p>On top of<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> Matplotlib, Seaborn is an open source Python<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> library that is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Seaborn works with Pandas DataFrames and supports built-in Python types such as lists and dictionaries. Most Seaborn functions support objects from the Pandas and NumPy libraries.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we reviewed the Python basics, including variables, data structures, condition and loop clauses, and various Python data libraries. It is essential to understand the Python code snippets in this chapter and go through the examples in <a href="B18333_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor195"><em class="italic">Appendix 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Practicing with Python Data Libraries</em>, where we have provided examples to help you practice using Python data libraries, step by step. By doing so, you can develop Python code with Google Colab. </p>
<p>Now we have built up the foundation of GCP and Python, it is time to conclude <em class="italic">Part 1</em> of this book. In <em class="italic">Part 2</em>, we will explore the ML process, including problem framing, data preparation and feature engineering, ML model development, neural networks, and deep learning. In this next chapter, we will look at ML problem framing.</p>

<p>This part introduces machine learning (ML) concepts. We start with the preparations for the machine learning process, including ML problem definition and data preparations. We dive into the ML process, including platform preparation, dataset splitting, model training, validation, testing, and deployment. We then introduce the modern ML concepts such as neural networks, deep learning, cost function, optimizer algorithm, activation function, and so on. We further discuss several neural network models and their business use cases.</p>
