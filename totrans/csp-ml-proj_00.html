            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">In the era of data, it is hard to overlook the importance of <strong class="calibre4">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">ML</strong>) and data science. ML has been used and adopted widely across many industries, and its adoption rate is growing faster than ever. Not only big technology companies, such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple, but also many non-technology companies such as Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs, invest heavily in ML. From searching for what to eat for dinner tonight on search engines to getting approvals for new credit cards, the applications of ML are everywhere in our daily lives. As a fellow data scientist and ML practitioner, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of ML in the current era of data, especially of big data.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you are looking for resources to learn applied ML, you have come to the right place. For many aspiring data scientists and ML practitioners, the amount of resources for applied ML in C# is lacking in the ML books out there. You can easily find books that have detailed explanations on the theory behind ML. You can also easily find books that touch the practical aspects of ML in different programming languages, such as Python. However, as you might have noticed, there are not many books that cover how to build practical ML models and applications using C#.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this book, we are going to focus on the practical side of ML and dive right into building ML models and applications for various real-world projects that are actively being researched and built in many different industries. By going through real-life examples of ML with real-world datasets, you will understand how other data scientists and ML practitioners actually build ML models and applications for their production systems. This book is unique in the sense that each chapter is an individual ML project that has a real-world business use case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this book, C# is the choice of language for the ML projects that we are going to work on. You might ask, <em class="calibre13">Why C#?</em> The answer is actually quite straightforward. As you might know already, C# is one of the most popular and widely used languages in the industry. Especially among finance companies, C# is one of the very few programming languages that is commonly accepted and used for their production applications.  </p>
<p class="calibre2">Personally, I would have benefited from books like this one when I was starting my career in data science. At that time, there was a discrepancy between what was taught in schools and what really works in real life (<span class="calibre5">and how)</span>. In this book, I would like to share the knowledge and experience that I had to learn the hard way.  In this book, we are going to discuss things that are not frequently talked about, such as h<span class="calibre5">ow ML projects typically start, how ML models are built and tested in different industries, how ML applications are then deployed on production systems, and how those ML models running in production systems are monitored and evaluated. We are going to work together throughout this book to help you get ready for any ML projects that you may come across in the future. </span><span class="calibre5">By the end of this book, you will be able to build robust and well-performing ML models and applications using C#.</span></p>

<p class="calibre2">This book is for those who know how to write code using C# and have a basic understanding of ML. Even if you do not have in-depth knowledge of the theories behind ML algorithms, don't worry! It is okay. This book will help you understand how you can use different learning algorithms for different use cases. If you have studied ML, maybe at school, on online courses, or at data science boot camps, then this book will be great for you. This book will show you how to actually apply the ML theories and concepts you have learned by going through nine real-world ML projects with real-world datasets. If you are already an ML practitioner, you will still greatly benefit from this book! By going through various real-world examples of applied ML, this book will help you expand your knowledge and experience of applying ML to various other business cases for many different industries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This book is really for anyone with a passion for applied ML. If you want to be able to build ML models and applications that can be used in production systems from day 1, then this book is for you!</p>

<p class="calibre2">To get the most out of this book, I recommend that you thoroughly follow each of the steps laid out in each chapter. Following through the code samples and running them on your own will help you understand better and get more comfortable with building ML models faster. I also recommend that you be adventurous and mix up the techniques and learning algorithms discussed in different chapters. When you are done with this book, it will be even better if you go through the projects yourself again from the beginning and start building your own versions of ML models for the individual projects.</p>
