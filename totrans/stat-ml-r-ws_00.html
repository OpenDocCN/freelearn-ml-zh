			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>&#13;
			<p>This workshop book is a comprehensive resource designed to offer a deep dive into the essential aspects of both statistics and machine learning. It provides explanations of key concepts with practical examples and hands-on exercises to enable a holistic learning experience. Starting with the fundamentals, the book walks you through the complete model development process, covering everything from data preprocessing to <span class="No-Break">model development.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In addition to its focus on machine learning, the book also delves into R’s statistical capabilities. You’ll learn how to manipulate various data types and tackle complex mathematical challenges, from algebra and calculus to probability and Bayesian statistics. The text even guides you through linear regression techniques and more advanced <span class="No-Break">statistical methodologies.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By the conclusion of this workshop book, you’ll not only have a robust foundational understanding of statistics and machine learning, but you will also be proficient in using R’s extensive libraries for tasks such as data processing and model training. Through this integrated approach, you’ll emerge well equipped to leverage the full power of R in your <span class="No-Break">future projects.</span></p>&#13;

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
			<p>To get the most out of this book, it’s advisable to have a basic understanding of programming, ideally in R, although a strong foundation in any programming language should suffice. Familiarity with elementary statistics and mathematical concepts will also be beneficial, as the book delves into statistical methods and mathematical models. While the book is structured to guide you from foundational to advanced topics, prior exposure to data analysis techniques will enhance your learning experience. If you’re new to R, you may want to spend some extra time on the initial chapters to become comfortable with the programming environment <span class="No-Break">and syntax.</span></p>&#13;
