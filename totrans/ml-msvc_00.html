			<p><strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) has revolutionized the technology industry and our daily lives in ways that were previously thought impossible. By combining ML algorithms with <strong class="bold">Microservices Architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">MSA</strong>), organizations are able to create intelligent, robust, flexible, and scalable enterprise systems that can adapt to changing business requirements and improve overall <span class="No-Break">system performance.</span></p>
			<p>This book is a comprehensive guide that covers different approaches to building intelligent MSA systems and solving common practical challenges faced in system design <span class="No-Break">and operations.</span></p>
			<p>The first part of the book provides a comprehensive introduction to MSA and its applications. You will learn about common enterprise system architectures, the concepts and value of MSA, and how it differs from traditional enterprise systems. In this part, you will gain an understanding of the design, deployment, and operation of MSA, including the basics of <span class="No-Break">DevOps processes.</span></p>
			<p>The second part of the book dives into ML and its applications in MSA systems. You will learn about the key ML algorithms and their applications in MSA, including regression models, multiclass classification, text analysis, and <strong class="bold">Deep Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">DL</strong>). This part provides a comprehensive guide on how to develop the ML model, components, and sub-components, and how to apply them in an <span class="No-Break">MSA system.</span></p>
			<p>The final part of the book brings together everything covered in the previous parts. It provides a step-by-step guide to designing and developing an intelligent system, with hands-on examples and actual code that can be imported for real-life use cases. You will also learn about the application of DevOps in enterprise MSA systems, including organizational structure alignment, quality assurance testing, and <span class="No-Break">change management.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have a solid understanding of MSA and its benefits and will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to build your own intelligent MSA system and take the first step toward achieving better business results, operational performance, and business continuity. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this book is the perfect guide to help you understand and apply MSA and ML in your <span class="No-Break">enterprise systems.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is ideal for ML solution architects, system and ML developers, and system and solution integrators. These individuals will gain the most from this book as it covers the critical concepts and best practices in ML. The book is written to provide these professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to implement intelligent <span class="No-Break">MSA solutions.</span></p>
			<p>To fully benefit from this book, you should have a basic understanding of system architecture and operations. Additionally, a working knowledge of the Python programming language is highly desired. This is because the examples and case studies included in the book are primarily implemented in Python. However, the concepts and best practices covered in this book can be applied to other programming languages and technologies as well. The book is designed to provide a solid foundation in ML, while also helping you to deepen your existing knowledge <span class="No-Break">and skills.</span></p>
