The introduction of Microsoft Cognitive Services gives developers the possibility to add these features with ease. It allows us to make smarter and more human-like applications.</p><p>This book aims to teach you how to utilize the APIs from Microsoft Cognitive Services. You will learn what each API has to offer and how you can add it to your application. You will see what the different API calls expect in terms of input data and what you can expect in return. Most of the APIs in this book are covered with both theory and practical examples.</p><p>This book has been written to help you get started. It focuses on showing how to use Microsoft Cognitive Services, keeping current best practices in mind. It is not intended to show advanced use cases, but to give you a starting point to start playing with the APIs yourself.</p><div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec06"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for .NET developers with some programming experience. It is assumed that you know how to do basic programming tasks as well as how to navigate in Visual Studio. No prior knowledge of artificial intelligence or machine learning is required to follow this book.</p><p>It is beneficial, but not required, to understand how web requests work.</p></div></div>
