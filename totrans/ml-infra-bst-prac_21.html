			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Summary and  Where to Go Next</h1>
			<p>This is the last chapter of this book. We’ve learned a lot – starting with understanding the differences between traditional and machine learning-based software. We’ve learned how to handle data and how to work with algorithms. We’ve also looked at how to deploy models and how to work ethically with machine learning. In this chapter, we’ll summarize the best practices and try to get a glimpse of future developments in the area of machine learning overlapped with <span class="No-Break">software engineering.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>To know where we are going, we need to know where <span class="No-Break">we’ve been</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Best practices</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Current developments</span></li>
				<li>My view on <span class="No-Break">the future</span></li>

			<p>My journey with computers started in the early 1990s, with Atari 800XL. Once I got my hands on that computer, I was amazed by the sheer fact that it could do what I told it to do. My first program was, of course, a program <span class="No-Break">in BASIC:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
10 PRINT Hello world!
20 GOTO 10</pre>			<p>It’s neither well-formed nor a very useful program, but that was all I could do at the time. This first program shaped my entire career as it sparked my interest in software development. Later on, during my professional career, I realized that professional software engineering is much more than just writing source code and compiling it. The programs need to be well-formed, well-documented, well-designed, and well-tested (among many other things). This observation, in turn, shaped my view on software engineering as a discipline that can turn homebrewed software into a piece of art that can be used over long periods if well maintained. That was in the early 2000s. Around 2015, I saw a potential in machine learning that also sparked my interest. The first project that I took part in was done by a colleague of mine who showed me how a random forest classifier can interpret programming language code and make inferences about defects. Fast forward to today, we have transformers, diffusers, autoencoders, and hybrid networks that can do amazing things <span class="No-Break">with data.</span></p>
			<p>However, we need to move from AI development to AI engineering, as we did from software development to software engineering. That brings us to this book, where I showed over 70 best practices in AI engineering. This book has taken us from the basic concepts of machine learning and AI in <em class="italic">Part I</em>, through handling data in <em class="italic">Part II</em> to algorithms and models in <em class="italic">Part III</em>. We also explored the ethical and legal aspects of designing, using, and deploying machine learning systems in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Part IV</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Best practices</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>first part of this book contains significantly more best practices, which is because these best practices relate to engineering software, designing it, and making crucial decisions about machine learning – for example, the first best practice tells us when to use (and not to use) <span class="No-Break">machine learning.</span></p>
			<p>As this part of this book was about the <em class="italic">machine learning landscape in software engineering</em>, we’ll discuss different types of models and data and show how they <span class="No-Break">come together.</span></p>
			<p>The list of best practices from the first part of this book is presented in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Table 17.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 17.4: Best practices in the fourth part of this book</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>best practices presented in this book are based on my experiences in designing, developing, testing, and deploying machine learning systems. These best practices are not exhaustive, and we could find more, depending on <span class="No-Break">our interests.</span></p>
			<p>To look for these best practices, I strongly suggest taking a look at the research publications that appear continuously in this area. In particular, I recommend following the main conferences in AI – that is, NeurIPS and AAAI – as well as the main conferences in software engineering – that is, ICSE, ASE, <span class="No-Break">and ESEC/FSE.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Current developments</h1>
			<p>At the time of writing this book, the Technology Innovation Institute<span class="superscript">  </span>(<a href="https://www.tii.ae/">https://www.tii.ae/</a>) has just released its largest model – Falcon 170B. It is the largest fully open source model that is similar to the GPT-3.5 model. It shows the current direction of the research in large <span class="No-Break">language models.</span></p>
			<p>Although GPT-4 exists, which is larger by a factor of 1,000, we can develop very good software <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>with moderately large models such as GPT-3.5. This brings us to some of the current topics that we, as a community, need to discuss. One of them is the energy sustainability of these models. Falcon-170B requires 400 GB of RAM (eight times that of an Nvidia A100 GPU) to execute (according to Hugging Face). We do not know how much hardware the GPT-4 model needs. The amount of electricity that it takes and the resources that it uses must be on par with what we get as value from <span class="No-Break">that model.</span></p>
			<p>We also approach limits to the conventional computational power when it comes to machine learning, which brings us to quantum computing (Cerezo, Verdon et al. 2022). However, although the idea of embedding machine learning in quantum computing formalism is quite appealing, it is not without its challenges. Machine learning systems/models need to be re-designed to fit the new paradigm and the new paradigm needs to be more accessible for AI engineers and <span class="No-Break">software engineers.</span></p>
			<p>When it comes<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> to algorithms, it is <em class="italic">swarming</em> that gets increasingly more attention, mostly due to the attention behind the <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) (Rosenberg 2016, Rajeesh Kumar, Jaya Lakshmi, et al. 2023). With the support of<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> technologies such as 5G and 6G in telecommunication, these developments are clearly on the rise and will continue to rise. However, one of the current challenges is fragmenting the protocols and technologies, which leads to challenges related to cybersecurity and attacks on <span class="No-Break">critical infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>Yet another alley of research that is currently growing is the area of <em class="italic">graph neural networks</em> (Gao, Zheng, et al. 2023). As the current architectures are limited to linear data or data or data that can be linearized, they cannot handle certain tasks. Programming language models are one example of such an area – although they are capable of many tasks, they cannot consider execution graphs or similar elements at the moment. Therefore, the graph neural models are seen to be the next development, although the main challenge to address there is related to the computational power needed for training and inference in the graph <span class="No-Break">neural models.</span></p>
			<p>At the same time, increasingly more studies are tackling the development of models and softer aspects of it, such as ethics, explainability, and their impact on society at large (Meskó and Topol 2023). Medicine, large language models, and the digitalization of society are just a few areas where intensive standardization of the work <span class="No-Break">is ongoing.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>My view on the future</h1>
			<p>Based on my observations of the machine learning landscape today, with a particular focus on software engineering, I can see a <span class="No-Break">few trends.</span></p>
			<p>Language models will get better at completing software engineering tasks, such as requirements, testing, and documenting. This means that software engineers will be able to focus on their core work – engineering software – rather than on tedious, repetitive tasks. We will see models that will test software, document it, explain it, and maybe even repair it. The latest advancements in this field are <span class="No-Break">very promising.</span></p>
			<p>Hybrid models will be more popular. Combining symbolic analysis and neural networks will gain traction and be able to assist us in finding advanced vulnerabilities in software, as well as identifying them before they are exploited. This will make our software more robust and more resilient <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>Large models and the availability of significant computational power will help us also to detect anomalies in software operations. By analyzing logs, we will be able to predict aging and we will be able to direct maintenance effort. Again, we will be able to focus on software engineering rather than <span class="No-Break">on analysis.</span></p>
			<p>And last, but not least, hybrid models will help us with design tasks. Combining image generation and other types of methods will help us in designing software – its architecture and detailed design, and even predicting the operational performance of <span class="No-Break">the software.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Final remarks</h1>
			<p>I hope that this book was interesting for you and that you have gained new knowledge in machine learning, AI, and engineering software. I hope that you can use this book as a reference and that you will use the associated code to create new products. I would also greatly appreciate it if you could let me know if you liked it, connect via LinkedIn, and contribute to this book’s GitHub repository. I will monitor it and integrate all pull requests that you <span class="No-Break">may have.</span></p>
			<p>Before we part, I have one last <span class="No-Break">best practice.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice #79</p>
			<p class="callout">Never <span class="No-Break">stop learning.</span></p>
			<p>Take this from a university professor. The field of machine learning grows quickly, with new models being introduced almost every week. Make sure that you observe the scientific publications in this area and commercial developments. This will help you keep your knowledge up-to-date and help you advance in your <span class="No-Break">professional career.</span></p>
