- en: In this section, we will discuss various popular machine learning algorithms
    and how they work. We will provide examples of situations in which they work well
    and when they should be avoided. The reader will learn about different machine
    learning algorithms and will be able to work with simple examples in scikit-learn
    and scale them into Apache Spark in the context of AWS. After reading the section,
    we expect readers to have a working knowledge of machine learning algorithms and
    how to implement them at scale in AWS.
