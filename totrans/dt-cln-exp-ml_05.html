<p>Anyone who has done a log transformation of a target, or scaled a feature, appreciates just how critical to our analysis preprocessing can be. Raise your hand if you were ever confident that your model approximated truth, but then tried a fairly obvious transformation and appreciated just how far from truth your original model was. Encoding, transforming, and scaling data is not a gimmick, though sometimes people have that impression. We apply that preprocessing because 1) it gets us closer to capturing a real-world process and 2) because many machine learning algorithms just work better with scaled data.</p>
<p>Feature selection is equally important. A good adage is never build a model with N features, when N - 1 features will do just as nicely. It is worth remembering that this is more complicated than having too many features. There are times when having 3 features is too many and others when having 103 features is perfectly fine. The issue is really whether the features are too correlated for their independent impact on the target to be disentangled. When that is not the case, the risks of overfitting and of unstable results increase substantially. We pay careful attention to feature selection in this part of the book and subsequently.</p>
<p>The chapter on model evaluation in this part prepares us for the work we will be doing in the rest of the book. We explore in detail the evaluation of both regression and classification models, those with continuous and categorical targets respectively. We also learn how to construct pipelines and do cross-validation. Most importantly, we learn about data leakage and how to avoid it.</p>
