- en: Since machine learning is based on patterns in the training data, we need to
    understand how to work with this kind of system from an ethical perspective. Ethics
    is one of these areas that software engineers are not the most familiar with.
    In this part of the book, we look into what kind of ethical issues exist in data
    acquisition and management and how to work with bias in machine learning algorithms.
    Finally, we finish up this part by exploring how to integrate what weâ€™ve learned
    in this book into an entire ecosystem of web services and how to deploy them.
