- en: MLOps is a systematic approach to building, deploying, and monitoring machine
    learning (ML) solutions. It is an engineering discipline that can be applied to
    various industries and use cases. This book presents comprehensive insights into
    MLOps coupled with real-world examples to help you to write programs, train robust
    and scalable ML models, and build ML pipelines to train and deploy models securely
    in production.

- en: You will begin by familiarizing yourself with MLOps workflow and start writing
    programs to train ML models. You’ll then move on to explore options for serializing
    and packaging ML models post-training to deploy them in production to facilitate
    machine learning inference. Next, you will learn about monitoring ML models and
    system performance using an explainable monitoring framework. Finally, you’ll
    apply the knowledge you’ve gained to build real-world projects.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16572_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Fundamentals
    of MLOps Workflow*, gives an overview of the changing software development landscape
    by highlighting how traditional software development is changing to facilitate
    machine learning. We will highlight some daily problems within organizations with
    the traditional approach, showcasing why a change in thinking and implementation
    is needed. Proceeding that an introduction to the importance of systematic machine
    learning will be given, followed by some concepts of machine learning and DevOps
    and fusing them into MLOps. The chapter ends with a proposal for a generic workflow
    to approach almost any machine learning problem.'

    Your Machine Learning Problem*, offers you a broad perspective on possible types
    of ML solutions for production. You will learn how to categorize solutions, create
    a roadmap for developing and deploying a solution, and procure the necessary data,
    tools, or infrastructure to get started with developing an ML solution taking
    a systematic approach.'
