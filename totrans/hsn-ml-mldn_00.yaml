    healthcare, and research and its popularity is only growing. In March 2018, Microsoft
    introduced ML.NET to help .NET enthusiasts to work with ML. With this book, you''ll
    explore how to build ML.NET applications with the various ML models available
    using C# code.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts by giving you an overview of ML and the types of ML algorithms
    used, along with covering what ML.NET is and why you need it to build ML apps.
    You’ll then explore the ML.NET framework, its components, and APIs. The book will
    serve as a practical guide to helping you build smart apps using the ML.NET library.
    You’ll gradually become well-versed in how to implement ML algorithms such as
    regression, classification, and clustering with real-world examples and datasets.
    Each chapter will cover the practical implementation, showing you how to implement
    ML within .NET applications. You'll also learn how to integrate TensorFlow into
    ML.NET applications. Later, you'll discover how to store the regression model
    housing price prediction results in the database and display the real-time predicted
    results from the database on your web application using ASP.NET Core Blazor and
    SignalR.

- en: If you are a .NET developer who wants to implement machine learning models using
    ML.NET, then this book is for you. This book will also be beneficial to data scientists
    and machine learning developers who are looking for effective tools to implement
    various machine learning algorithms. A basic understanding of C# and .NET is mandatory
    to grasp the concepts covered in this book effectively.

    Machine Learning and ML.NET*, talks about what machine learning is and how important
    machine learning is in our society today. It also introduces ML.NET and talks
    in more detail about getting started with it after learning about the concepts
    of machine learning and how they relate.'

    Environment*, talks in more detail about getting started with ML.NET, continuing
    the overview of machine learning and how ML.NET can assist in both developing
    and running models in both new and existing applications. You will ensure your
    development environment is set up and the chapter ends with a simple pre-trained
    model in a console application to demonstrate that you are ready to proceed with
    the training.'

    about using a regression and logistic regression model in ML.NET in addition to
    the math and what problems these models can help to solve. In addition, the chapter
    provides a step-by-step explanation of how to create and work with both a regression
    model and a logistic regression model in ML.NET. The end of the chapter details
    a quick console application using the dataset and both the models in ML.NET.'

    about using the classifications trainer models in ML.NET and what problems a classification
    model can help to solve. For this chapter, we will create two applications to
    demonstrate the classification trainer support in ML.NET.  The first predicts
    whether a car is of good value based on the several attributes and comparative
    prices using the FastTree trainer that ML.NET provides. The second application
    takes email data (Subject, Body, Sender) with the SDCA trainer in ML.NET to classify
    the email as an Order, Spam or Friend. Through these applications, you will also
    learn how to evaluate classification models.'

    a clustering model can help to solve.  In this chapter, we will use the k-means
    cluster trainer that ML.NET provides in order to create an example application
    that will classify files as either executables, documents, or scripts.  In addition,
    you will learn how to evaluate clustering models in ML.NET.'

    what problems an anomaly detection model can help to solve. For this chapter,
    we will create two example applications. The first uses ML.NET with SSA to detect
    Network Traffic anomalies, while the second example uses ML.NET with PCA to detect
    anomalies in a series of user logins. With these applications, we will also look
    at how you can evaluate your anomaly detection model once trained.'

    the math and what problems a matrix factorization model can help to solve.  In
    this chapter, we will create a music recommendation application using the matrix
    factorization trainer that ML.NET provides. Using several data points this recommendation
    engine will recommend music based on the training data provided to the model.
    In addition, after creating this application we will learn how to evaluate a matrix
    factorization model in ML.NET.'
