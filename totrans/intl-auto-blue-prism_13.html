			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Other Intelligent Blue Prism Products and Future IA Trends</h1>
			<p>Outside of the core BP RPA software, there are other products that round out BP’s IA portfolio. In this chapter, we’ll discuss four of these products. Our goals for this chapter are to understand the products’ purpose and to see how they fit into IA. We’ll also walk through the high-level steps of using each product. Finally, we’ll see what next steps are needed if you’d like to try them out and how to find out more information. To finish off the book, I’ll also discuss what I think are the future trends <span class="No-Break">of IA.</span></p>
			<p>The four BP products that we’ll discuss are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Decipher <strong class="bold">Intelligent Document </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Processing</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">IDP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Document Automation</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Decision</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Interact</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Decipher IDP</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Decipher</strong> <strong class="bold">IDP</strong><a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> is a <em class="italic">document-processing</em> solution that provides OCR, document classification, entity extraction, table extraction, and a web interface for HITL correction and training of documents. Decipher was released in June 2020 and has received continuous upgrades since, so it has been battle-tested by many other firms. If you need to extract content from scans or images of computer-generated (not handwritten) documents, you should consider <span class="No-Break">using Decipher.</span></p>
			<p>As someone who has used Decipher, and has heard feedback from BP customers who’ve used it, it’s definitely worth considering for computer-generated documents. It also works well for documents with tables that have varying numbers of rows. Forms with lots of handwriting aren’t supported yet (although it is supported in the next product that will <span class="No-Break">be discussed).</span></p>
			<p>I’ve seen some <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>BP customers and partners build less fully featured document-processing solutions in-house, which takes months of development effort at a minimum. Decipher gives you a document-processing solution free of charge, provided that your company has either a Production or Business-Critical support plan <span class="No-Break">with BP.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>How is Decipher related to IA?</h2>
			<p>Extracting<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> fields from documents so that they can be processed by RPA is one of the most common IA use cases, so much so, that every major RPA vendor has a product dedicated to <span class="No-Break">that task.</span></p>
			<p>Behind the scenes, Decipher uses ML in multiple places. First, Decipher uses an OCR engine (Tesseract), which itself has pretrained ML models that are used to recognize text. Next, Decipher can train <em class="italic">document classification models</em> to differentiate between different types of documents. For example, you might have an email account that receives both quotations and invoices as attachments. Decipher can help you differentiate between these two types of documents and start them down different automation <span class="No-Break">processing paths.</span></p>
			<p>Decipher can also train document-specific models to <em class="italic">extract pre-specified entities</em>, or <em class="italic">structured data</em> from documents. Pre-specified means that you have to tell Decipher ahead of time what you’re trying to extract, for example, an invoice number or a total price. When you’re presented with the web UI to correct the entity predictions, you’ll see exactly the fields that you’ve specified. Decipher can also handle <em class="italic">semi-structured</em> data, meaning documents with fields in fixed positions, as well as tabular items that can vary <span class="No-Break">in length.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, there’s also an NLP plugin that can extract <em class="italic">unstructured data</em>. This plugin requires a GPU to be installed. From looking at the third-party license acknowledgments of the plugin, it uses Keras and Tensorflow, indicating that some neural networks or deep learning models are being <span class="No-Break">used here.</span></p>
			<p>Decipher also<a id="_idIndexMarker964"/> comes with a <em class="italic">HITL web interface</em> that can be used to verify and correct predictions for extracted document fields. The extracted fields for your pre-specified entities are displayed side-by-side to the actual document so that it’s easy to compare the two and <span class="No-Break">make amendments.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Using Decipher</h2>
			<p>A high-level view of how <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>you’d use Decipher is <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Decipher web interface, define what <em class="italic">types of documents</em> you want to extract, such as application forms, invoices, financial <span class="No-Break">statements, etc.</span></li>
				<li>For each <em class="italic">document type</em> that was previously defined, specify which <em class="italic">fields</em> and <em class="italic">tables</em> you want to extract. These first two steps are only done once, unless you need to change what fields you want to extract from the document. Changing the fields will result in having to retrain the entire ML model for this <span class="No-Break">document type.</span></li>
				<li>From BP, send in a batch of images or documents into Decipher. This is done through a sequence of Actions from the <strong class="bold">Decipher</strong> VBO: <strong class="bold">Create Batch</strong>, <strong class="bold">Add File to Batch</strong> (which must be done on each individual file) and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Submit Batch</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Decipher processes the documents in the background and tries to perform the classification or extraction. It determines whether human review of documents is necessary based on the confidence score from the model and the default <em class="italic">threshold</em> values, which can be changed by <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></li>
				<li>The user checks to see whether there are documents that need to be reviewed. This checking can be done either from a BP Process, by using the <strong class="bold">Has Batches to Verify</strong> Action, or by visiting the Decipher UI and checking manually. If HITL review is required, the user visits the web UI and corrects what Decipher has extracted. Corrections made will be fed back into the ML model, improving the accuracy <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li>In BP, there needs to be a Process that checks whether a completed batch exists, using the <strong class="bold">Decipher</strong> VBO Action <strong class="bold">Get Next Completed Batch</strong>. A completed batch contains human-reviewed documents, and documents that didn’t need human review due to surpassing the threshold requirements. If there are completed batches, we can loop through the completed batches’ documents <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>extracted data for BP processing using the <strong class="bold">Get Document </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Data</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> Action.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Next steps</h2>
			<p>Decipher <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>can be directly downloaded from the BP Portal: <a href="https://portal.blueprism.com/products/decipher">https://portal.blueprism.com/products/decipher</a>. If you don’t have a Decipher license already, you’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>need to request one from your <span class="No-Break">sales representative.</span></p>
			<p>You’ll also need to provision new infrastructure to install Decipher on. The minimum requirements are listed here: <a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/decipher-2-2/en-us/getting-started/minimum-requirements.htm">https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/decipher-2-2/en-us/getting-started/minimum-requirements.htm</a>. An objection that I’ve seen customers raise with using IDP comes from the infrastructure requirements and especially the added dependencies. Decipher requires a RabbitMQ message broker to be installed, and some IT teams aren’t prepared or willing to <span class="No-Break">support that.</span></p>
			<p>For pilots or testing, it’s feasible to have the entirety of Decipher, including all of its dependencies installed on a single VM. For a production deployment, you’ll probably need another four VMs, unless you’re willing to host some of the Decipher components together, and that’s not accounting for high availability and disaster recovery. The infrastructure costs of Decipher should be considered ahead of time. The sizing of the VMs is also tricky, as you need to estimate the number of pages per hour that you intend to put through the different Decipher components. A sizing guide can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/decipher-2-2/en-us/Guides/Architecture/sizing.htm"><span class="No-Break">https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/decipher-2-2/en-us/Guides/Architecture/sizing.htm</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Decipher does require some training to use. The learning curve isn’t as steep as regular BP, but you should still expect to spend at least a week or two playing around with the system before you start to become productive. More information about Decipher can be found on the BP Documentation website: <a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/decipher-2-2/en-us/home.htm">https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/decipher-2-2/en-us/home.htm</a>. Finally, the BP Portal website has templates and instructions for use with <span class="No-Break">Decipher: </span><a href="https://portal.blueprism.com/products/developer-jumpstart"><span class="No-Break">https://portal.blueprism.com/products/developer-jumpstart</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Document Automation</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Document Automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">DA</strong>) is BP’s second document processing solution. DA was in development at <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>SS&amp;C (BP’s parent company), before they acquired BP. Post-acquisition, DA was integrated into the BP product line. At a high level, DA is used to extract <em class="italic">structured</em> data, or documents with a fixed format where the positions of the document fields don’t change. It excels at handling low-quality digital documents and can deal with <span class="No-Break">handwritten text.</span></p>
			<p>I’ve not used<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> DA under a production scenario, but I have gone through the internal training materials. One of the key benefits of DA is that it’s a completely <em class="italic">hosted solution</em> that’s compliant with HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, etc. There are no infrastructure concerns, unlike Decipher. It’s also a proven system with many customers and millions of pages processed. If you’re concerned about sending your documents outside of your firm, you can specify data retention periods in DA, so that documents older than a certain date are purged from <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>DA differs from<a id="_idIndexMarker971"/> Decipher IDP in the <span class="No-Break">following ways:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>DA specializes in extracting <em class="italic">handwritten</em> or printed data that’s in <em class="italic">low-quality</em> digital formats. Examples are scanned and faxed documents that have low accuracy when extracted with standard OCR technology. Decipher can’t handle handwritten data as of <span class="No-Break">version 2.2.</span></li>
				<li>DA focuses on <em class="italic">structured</em> documents whereas Decipher can deal with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents (with the NLP plugin). DA doesn’t handle documents that have tables with varying numbers <span class="No-Break">of rows.</span></li>
				<li>DA is a <em class="italic">hosted</em> service that can’t be installed on premises. Decipher is installed, hosted, and maintained by <span class="No-Break">the customer.</span></li>
				<li>DA has a separate licensing model that’s unrelated to BP’s license. It isn’t free of charge. Decipher is <em class="italic">free</em> for up to 4,000 pages per license per month, as long as you’re on either the Production or Business-Critical BP <span class="No-Break">support plan.</span></li>
				<li>DA can be used as a standalone product without BP. The link between DA and BP is through a connector asset on the DX: <a href="https://digitalexchange.blueprism.com/dx/entry/9648/solution/chorus-document-automation">https://digitalexchange.blueprism.com/dx/entry/9648/solution/chorus-document-automation</a>. Decipher integrates closely with BP and can’t be used without BP, unless you develop some major <span class="No-Break">custom workarounds.</span></li>
				<li>DA doesn’t train individual ML models for each type of document that you have. Decipher has a loop in the product that goes through training, correcting the extracted data (if necessary), retraining, and getting feedback. While DA has a web interface to review the extracted data, it’s only used to correct data. Corrections aren’t used to improve a model that’s unique <span class="No-Break">to you.</span></li>
				<li>From an <a id="_idIndexMarker972"/>end-user perspective, DA is easier to use because many ML concepts don’t need to be considered. Decipher requires training and has a longer lead time to <span class="No-Break">get started.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>How is Document Automation related to IA?</h2>
			<p>DA fits a<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> similar use case to Decipher. You’d use it to convert documents into CSV/JSON formats so that they can be further processed by BP. The difference lies in what types of documents DA excels at processing, the use of generic ML models (as opposed to a specific model that’s fit to your documents), and the user interface. DA is used for documents with fixed formats that have been potentially filled in <span class="No-Break">with handwriting.</span></p>
			<p>Behind the scenes, DA has a proprietary AI algorithm that uses neural networks. This model was trained on a human-corrected dataset of over 1.2 billion datapoints. The average accuracy of this model is 96% across all of DA’s <span class="No-Break">enterprise customers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Using Document Automation</h2>
			<p>At a high level, the<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> steps to use DA are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>In DA’s web interface, define the <em class="italic">fields</em> you want to extract from a document, for example, first name, last name, and address. Fields have a “name” and a data type, for instance, Medium Text, Select One, Signature, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
				<li>Define a <em class="italic">template</em>. A template represents a form that can span multiple pages. Upload examples of the template pages to DA in image, or PDF format. Once a template file is uploaded, it will be displayed in the web UI, alongside all of the fields that <span class="No-Break">you’ve defined.</span></li>
				<li>Draw boxes on the template image where your selected fields should appear. This is how you map which fields belong to a template. This also tells DA roughly where in terms of x, y coordinates it should look to extract a <span class="No-Break">particular field.</span></li>
				<li>Upload a <em class="italic">batch</em> of documents to DA, either through the web UI, the API (which is what the DX asset uses), or by uploading the documents to cloud storage, such as AWS S3 or <span class="No-Break">Google Drive.</span></li>
				<li>Submit the batch and specify which template you want to use. You can also let DA select the template for you. DA uses alignment features, such as lines and logos and the bounding boxes of fields that are present in the templates to find the best <span class="No-Break">matching template.</span></li>
				<li>DA processes the documents in the background. If needed, it will choose the best matching template to use. Then it will extract the data according to the fields that <span class="No-Break">were defined.</span></li>
				<li>(Optional) Review and correct the extracted data side by side to the actual document, through the <span class="No-Break">web UI.</span></li>
				<li>Apply transformations to the fields, such as date formatting <span class="No-Break">and capitalization.</span></li>
				<li>Retrieve <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>the extracted data through the web UI or API in CSV or <span class="No-Break">JSON format.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Next steps</h2>
			<p>There’s a free trial<a id="_idIndexMarker976"/> available, that you can sign up for here: <a href="https://shreddr.captricity.com/accounts/signup">https://shreddr.captricity.com/accounts/signup</a>. Production usage requires getting a quote<a id="_idIndexMarker977"/> from a sales representative. There’s no fixed pricing, as it depends on numerous factors, such as the volume of pages that you need to process, and the SLA that you need. There’s also a Professional Services engagement that you can consider to fast-track moving a use case into production. Your sales representative can help you with this as well. More information on DA can be found on the documentation <span class="No-Break">website </span><a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/document-automation/en-us/home.htm"><span class="No-Break">https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/document-automation/en-us/home.htm</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Decision</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Decision</strong> (not to be confused with Decision Stages) is a product that allows developers to replace complex <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>Decision and Choice Stage logic with an ML model call. If you have complex, nested if-else branching, you can consider using <span class="No-Break">Decision instead.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer298" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18416_13_1.jpg" alt="Figure 13.1 – Convert complex Decision and Choice Stage logic to a single Action" width="1549" height="857"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.1 – Convert complex Decision and Choice Stage logic to a single Action</p>
			<p>It’s suitable for teams that don’t have access to data scientists, and have some RPA success already, but are just getting started on their IA journey. Decision will allow them to get their feet wet with IA in some form, even if they aren’t familiar with the concepts of training a new model, deploying it, and <span class="No-Break">auditing predictions.</span></p>
			<p>Decision is an<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> AutoML solution that conceals ML lifecycle complexities from users. Users simply define the potential outputs and inputs of the model through a web interface. Decision then generates random variations of the inputs and asks the user what the correct prediction should be. After a few rounds of this, an ML model <span class="No-Break">is built.</span></p>
			<p>Decision isn’t a standalone solution. It’s a <em class="italic">plugin</em> that’s installed and administered through another web-based product <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>called <strong class="bold">Blue Prism Hub</strong>. If you’re looking to try Decision, you’ll need to have a working Hub installation as <span class="No-Break">a prerequisite.</span></p>
			<p>I don’t think that Decision is suitable for use cases where there are many columns of input data (&gt; 10). The reason for this is that “training” is done one sample at a time through Hub’s web UI by someone manually looking at the inputs and telling Decision what the prediction should be. Large numbers of inputs make this process very cumbersome. I also think that Decision has to compete with a viable alternative, which is to simply create the complicated logic diagram through the Process Studio. Another point to consider is how straightforward the logic is to change. Imagine you need to add another input to the model, or add another prediction output possibility. This could lead to redoing the entire “training” process of the model, which could be extremely time consuming, since<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> it’s done through a web UI. It might be easier to modify a Process <span class="No-Break">diagram instead.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>How is Decision related to IA?</h2>
			<p>Decision<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> provides a direct way to build and deploy ML models into Production. Installing Decision requires deploying a new server, although you can cohost it on the server where Hub resides. The model runs as a web-based service on either Windows or Linux.  Decision features model versioning which was an important topic featured in multiple previous chapters. There’s also a model history audit trail that keeps track of the inputs, output, confidence scores, and model version for <span class="No-Break">all predictions.</span></p>
			<p>The model should have tabular inputs. You can’t use it with image, audio, or prompt inputs. The output can either be numerical (regression) or categorical (classification) While the underlying model isn’t public knowledge, based on the third-party acknowledgments that reference scikit-learn and SciPy, I expect that it’s using a tree-based algorithm. Tree-based algorithms are also one of the few families of algorithms that work for both regression and classification problems, and they can be trained <span class="No-Break">relatively quickly.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Using Decision</h2>
			<p>At a high<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> level, the steps to use Decision are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a new Decision model <span class="No-Break">in Hub.</span></li>
				<li>Choose what type of output the model should predict. This can be either numerical or categorical (label text). If numerical, you can limit the range of numbers that are predicted. If categorical, you can define the list <span class="No-Break">of labels.</span></li>
				<li>Define the input variables to the model by giving each an identifying name and type (numerical <span class="No-Break">or categorical).</span></li>
				<li>Now that the inputs and output have been defined, we can add fixed rules. Fixed rules are run before the ML model is used. This allows you to have a hybrid decision-making strategy that first uses fixed, hardcoded rules, followed by an <span class="No-Break">ML model.</span></li>
				<li>If the model output is categorical, you’ll need to manually create one data sample for each prediction label you’ve defined. Decision will loop through each of the potential prediction outputs, and you’ll be asked to create one set of inputs that leads to <span class="No-Break">that prediction.</span></li>
				<li>After one data sample is created for each output, Decision starts to present randomized permutations of the input data, and you’re asked to select the correct prediction. This is known as the <em class="italic">training</em> phase of Decision. As you do more of these, the model should become more accurate. Stop when you feel that the model meets your <span class="No-Break">accuracy requirements.</span></li>
				<li>At this<a id="_idIndexMarker984"/> point, we have a model that has been trained using multiple human-validated datapoints. Next, Decision uses the model, generates random input data, and shows you its prediction and the confidence level. You have two choices here. First, you can correct the prediction if it’s incorrect. Alternatively, you can change the input data so that it results in the prediction that Decision has been made. This is known as the <em class="italic">calibration</em> stage of Decision. Repeat this step as many times are <span class="No-Break">you like.</span></li>
				<li>Save the model and make a note of the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Model Id</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>In your<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> BP diagram, use the <strong class="bold">Utility - Decision</strong> VBO and the <strong class="bold">Get Prediction</strong> Action, and pass in the <strong class="bold">Model Id</strong> (as well as your input data). The predicted output and confidence will <span class="No-Break">be returned.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Next steps</h2>
			<p>Decision is <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>available to customers who have Production or Business-Critical support plans. If your company is on one of these plans, you can request a Decision license through your sales representative. With the license ready, you can download <a id="_idIndexMarker987"/>Decision from <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://portal.blueprism.com/product/related-products/decision"><span class="No-Break">https://portal.blueprism.com/product/related-products/decision</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Assuming that you already have Hub, setting up Decision isn’t very complicated. It requires just one more Server in most cases. However, if you don’t already have Hub, you’ll need to prepare yourself for a very large deployment, as the infrastructure design and installation of Hub, which is a prerequisite to Decision, is <span class="No-Break">very complicated.</span></p>
			<p>Further documentation on Decision can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/hub-interact/4-7/en-us/home-decision.htm"><span class="No-Break">https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/hub-interact/4-7/en-us/home-decision.htm</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Interact</h1>
			<p>Interact is another <a id="_idIndexMarker988"/>product that’s a part of BP Hub. It’s a web-based HITL interface that enables collaboration between people (typically business users) and their BP Digital Workers. Through Interact, you can design web forms to show to business users and ask them for input. When a business user submits an Interact web form, you can do a variety of things, such as trigger a Process to start, or continue a Process that was waiting for <span class="No-Break">human approval.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>How is Interact related to IA?</h2>
			<p>As you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker989"/>probably guessed, Interact is a good choice for an ML prediction review interface. It has BP Actions to push review data into an Interact form. Forms can be assigned to a specific Interact user (called a reviewer), or a group of reviewers. The reviewer can fill in the form with the correct prediction, and send it back into BP for further processing. It’s tightly integrated into the BP Enterprise product so you don’t need to use potentially brittle data-sharing interfaces such as Excel files in <span class="No-Break">shared folders.</span></p>
			<p>Interact will work for numerical and text-based input and output values. It won’t work if the ML inputs/output has images, as Interact can’t show images in the web UI. Interact also has its own audit trail that keeps track of who performed the review, and what their reviewed <span class="No-Break">prediction was.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Using Interact</h2>
			<p>At a high level, the <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>steps to use Interact as an interface to review ML predictions are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create an Interact form. A form must be associated with a <span class="No-Break">BP Process.</span></li>
				<li>Set the Work Queue into which reviewed prediction data should be pushed. This should be a new Queue and not the one used in the original Process. Set an SLA for the form if required. This would correspond to the HITL <span class="No-Break">review SLA.</span></li>
				<li>Add pages to the form if you need to break your form up into <span class="No-Break">multiple pages.</span></li>
				<li>Add the desired form fields such as text, file uploads, and tables onto the pages. All of these fields can have default values, ranges, and restrictions on what inputs can <span class="No-Break">be entered.</span></li>
				<li>Save <span class="No-Break">the form.</span></li>
				<li>Deploy the form by adding an Interact user role to the form. This maps Interact users to the forms that they can access <span class="No-Break">and submit.</span></li>
				<li>Amend the Process that makes ML predictions to use the <strong class="bold">Utility – Interact API</strong> VBO. Once the Process determines that HITL review is required, the Digital Worker should retrieve the form and fill it in with the input data and prediction. Then use the <strong class="bold">Raise Submission</strong> or <strong class="bold">Raise Submission to Role</strong> Action to request someone to review the prediction. The Work Queue Item should store a reference to the <strong class="bold">_requestId</strong> Data Item returned by <span class="No-Break">the Action.</span></li>
				<li>The Interact user (reviewer) visits the Interact web UI and corrects the submission. This creates a new Item in new the Work Queue described in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">step 2</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

			<p>Interact is available <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>to customers who have Production or Business-Critical support plans. If your company is on one of these plans, you can request for an Interact license through your sales representative. With the license ready, you can download<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> Interact from <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://portal.blueprism.com/product/related-products/blue-prism-interact-premise"><span class="No-Break">https://portal.blueprism.com/product/related-products/blue-prism-interact-premise</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Installing Interact is a fairly complex process, even when we exclude the Hub parts of the equation. Further details around the infrastructure, hardware, and software requirements of Interact can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/hub-interact/4-7/en-us/installation/install-interact.htm"><span class="No-Break">https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/hub-interact/4-7/en-us/installation/install-interact.htm</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>BP Professional Services has an Interact Accelerator package to receive guidance from Interact experts. The most difficult part will be designing your forms, and the installation, both of which are covered by this offering. You can reach out to your sales representative for more information. The learning curve of the product itself isn’t so bad, but getting Interact set up from an infrastructure point of view can be a multi-month affair.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Future IA trends</h1>
			<p>I believe that three broad<a id="_idIndexMarker994"/> IA trends will play out in the coming years. The first is an accelerated integration of AI directly into the RPA product suite. Next is the widespread adoption of LLMs for generic, low-cognitive AI tasks. And the third trend is increased scrutiny of IA, for ethics and <span class="No-Break">safety reasons.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Improved AI product integration</h2>
			<p>As we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker995"/> seen in this chapter, BP (and other RPA vendors) have numerous AI-related products as part of their product suites already. But as IA starts to develop, I think that the following changes to the product offerings <span class="No-Break">will occur:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>There will be an increased push towards using the cloud-based version of products, with updated terms of service that allow vendors to capture high-level information about your process flows. Most RPA vendors will want to start training their own LLM-like models, and offer a Copilot-style of <span class="No-Break">product functionality.</span></li>
				<li>The HITL interface tools for ML review and building ML models will become more tightly integrated. In BP, this would be Interact <span class="No-Break">and Decision.</span></li>
				<li>The addition of data and ML model <span class="No-Break">monitoring tools.</span></li>
				<li>This is probably a number of years away, but expect the release of products that implement generic ML interpretability techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and ICE plots that tie into the ML audit logs automatically. These interpretability techniques would be for models that are built using the vendor’s ML product suite, such as Decision. This is because many of these techniques require very tight integration to the models themselves. Some require server log access and access to the original training data. Both this and the preceding point will be needed due to increased scrutiny on using ML <span class="No-Break">in business.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Democratized ML using LLMs</h2>
			<p>Many people<a id="_idIndexMarker996"/> think that LLMs will lead to an explosion of chatbot-based IA use cases. While this may be the case, I believe that the greater value-add of LLMs is that they democratize ML, similar to how low-code development solutions have democratized parts of <span class="No-Break">software development.</span></p>
			<p>The advent of LLMs allows citizen developers to participate in the use of ML and develop their own IA process flows. Before LLMs, I would place ML beyond the typical citizen developer’s skill level, but that won’t be the case for very much longer. While the use cases of LLMs remain in the class of cognitive skills that can be done by junior high school students, such as data extraction and text generation, we can expect this to improve over time. As LLMs become more powerful, citizen developers will have access to increasingly <span class="No-Break">powerful AI.</span></p>
			<p>Despite this, there will<a id="_idIndexMarker997"/> always be reasons to custom-build ML models. When there’s potential scrutiny around your use of AI, you’d be well served to build a custom model with data and a technology stack that you’ve vetted. LLMs won’t hold up to this degree of scrutiny as the datasets needed to create them are too vast <span class="No-Break">to understand.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>AI ethics and safety</h2>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>mentioned in <a href="B18416_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, governments are currently shaping their views on AI and IA, and how these relate to human workers. Universities and other policy think tanks are also throwing their opinions into the mix to help shape AI policy. For example, in November 2023, MIT published a number of government policy briefs to help shape the governance of AI. These briefs can be found here: <a href="https://computing.mit.edu/ai-policy-briefs">https://computing.mit.edu/ai-policy-briefs</a>. While these haven’t become full regulation, reading them gives us a sense of what is likely to come in the future. Here are some of the policy recommendations that are directly relevant to <span class="No-Break">this book:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>AI must be regulated, potentially by newly established <span class="No-Break">federal agencies.</span></li>
				<li>Auditing regimes of AI systems must be developed. Some high-risk use cases should require auditing before they’re put to use, while low-risk use cases could be <span class="No-Break">audited retrospectively.</span></li>
				<li>AI systems should <span class="No-Break">be interpretable.</span></li>
				<li>In terms of liability, the ultimate provider of the service should be responsible, even if the model is built on top of another <span class="No-Break">foundational model.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This book was written with a broad view of future AI governance in mind. IA must happen within the bounds of the regulatory system, which is being shaped as we speak. IA team members should make a conscious effort to stay up to date with local developments in AI regulation and tune their internal practices to meet local <span class="No-Break">regulatory requirements.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at four additional BP products that can help you on your IA journey. Two of these products, <em class="italic">Decipher IDP</em> and <em class="italic">Document Automation</em> focus on processing documents using ML. Document Automation is a hosted solution that focuses on extracting data from poor-quality scanned documents with handwriting in fixed, structured forms. Decipher is a self-hosted solution that builds ML models specific to your document types. It can classify documents and extract data from structured, semi-structured, and <span class="No-Break">unstructured documents.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Decision</em> is an AutoML product that hides the complexities of ML away from the users. It can be used to replace complex Decision and Choice Stage logic with a single ML call. Users can quickly create models through Decision’s web interface on Hub. First, specify what the predicted output should be. Then define the inputs. Decision then presents the user with different combinations of inputs, and asks them to provide the correct prediction. A model will be built after repeating this a few times. Decision has built-in IA best practices, such as ML versioning and <span class="No-Break">audit trails.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Interact</em> is BP’s solution to human-robot collaboration. Through Interact, you can define web forms that are presented to users (reviewers) through the Hub platform. Users can interact with BP Digital Workers in numerous ways through these forms. For example, they can trigger a Process to start, or act as a reviewer for ML predictions. SLAs for the reviews can also <span class="No-Break">be defined.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we discussed three future IA trends that I believe will happen in the next few years. First, there will be many improvements to vendor product offerings to address IA-specific concerns. Next, LLMs will greatly expand the number of IA use cases, as citizen developers are enabled to use ML in their business processes. And third, regulations around the use of AI will start to change our IA practices as they become <span class="No-Break">better defined.</span></p>
			<p>Congratulations on completing this book! I hope that the knowledge and examples will serve you and your company well on your IA journey. As a final bonus, I’ve included a summary of my thesis research as it relates to this book in the <em class="italic">Appendix</em> that follows. While the thesis summary isn’t BP specific, the information should be relevant to everyone involved in IA, from developers to consultants and heads <span class="No-Break">of automation.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-231" class="chapter-number"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Appendix</h1>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>IA Risk Management</h1>
			<p>This appendix summarizes a portion of my IA thesis research. A primary focus of my research was to <em class="italic">elicit the risks that IA entails to firms</em>. The motivation behind this is to refine the industry’s understanding of this under-studied and under-appreciated topic, which I believe is critically important to the global adoption and success of IA. I also hope that understanding the risks of IA will force us to consider how to address those risks and reduce the negative effects that automation can have <span class="No-Break">on society.</span></p>
			<p>My study revealed <strong class="bold">36</strong> IA risks. These risks were categorized into two main groups: <strong class="bold">socio-organizational</strong> and <strong class="bold">operational</strong>. <em class="italic">Socio-organizational</em> risks stem from the relationships between different social constructs. This could, for example, be between firms and the legal system, or management and employees. <em class="italic">Operational</em> risks are those that appear during ongoing IA operations. They’re narrower in scope compared to socio-organizational risks, and are project-based or technical <span class="No-Break">in nature.</span></p>
			<p>I also looked at what <strong class="bold">mitigation measures</strong> exist to combat the IA risks. These risk mitigation techniques have guided the development of this book and have been implemented into the <em class="italic">reusable IA templates</em>, where possible. You can take advantage of numerous risk-reducing measures simply by using the templates as a starting point for your IA <span class="No-Break">solution designs.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Socio-organizational IA risks</h1>
			<p>Four <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>organizational constructs were identified. They are the <em class="italic">environment</em>, the <em class="italic">enterprise</em>, <em class="italic">third parties</em>, and <em class="italic">employees</em>. Conflicts between these groups led to 22 <span class="No-Break">IA risks.</span></p>
