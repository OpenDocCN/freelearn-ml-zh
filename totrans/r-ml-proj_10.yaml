    (**ML**), and **artificial intelligence** (**AI**). Just look at the number of
    start-ups with the terms ML and AI in their tag lines, the focal points for acquisitions
    on the part of big companies, and the topics at the biggest tech conferences.
    It does not take a long time for us to realize that data, ML, and AI are omnipresent,
    and I believe that this trend is going to continue for a few years to come. More
    and more industries are going to utilize ML and AI in a big way. This essentially
    is going to create gaps in available talent in terms of implementing ML and AI
    in businesses. Therefore, this is the best time to invest in learning more and
    more in this area. AI and ML skills, combined with business skills, will be the
    most highly prized within the industry.

    algorithms, new platforms, new infrastructure, and new types of data are just
    a few examples. To stay relevant, the only option is to keep ourselves updated
    with the newest trends and techniques out there. The other characteristics that
    are the most sought-after are unlearning the old and learning the new, and being
    flexible and modest enough to say, *it is okay that I don't know, but I am open
    to learning*.

    there is no dearth of resources—**Massive Open Online Courses** (**MOOCs**), books,
    blogs, conferences, seminars, classes, and so on. All that is needed is time and
    a willingness to learn. Happy learning in order to happily excel!
