    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-55">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="normal">Writing code or text takes time, at least if you want it to be well organized and readable. But what if you could have a tool that would help you write code faster and with less effort? That’s what GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are really all about.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Before you start using an AI assistant, it’s a good idea to get a mile-high view of its capabilities and limitations. You want to see what you can and can’t use it for, or at least understand where the tool performs less well.</p>
    <p class="normal1">In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist">Understanding what GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are and how they work</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Learning about Copilot’s capabilities and limits</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Installing GitHub Copilot</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Generating code completions via GitHub Copilot</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-56">Understanding Copilot</h1>
    <p class="normal">Pair programming<a id="_idIndexMarker046" class="calibre3"/> is the idea of (usually two) developers working together, often in front of the same screen, also sometimes called “pairing.” GitHub<a id="_idIndexMarker047" class="calibre3"/> Copilot can be seen as an “AI pair programmer” that helps you write code, enabling you to get more done, faster. It’s based on OpenAI’s Codex model, a new AI system trained on publicly available source code and natural language. But in reality, it has gone beyond this. Let’s denote GitHub Copilot as Copilot for the remainder of the book. Copilot suggests whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-57">How Copilot knows what to generate</h2>
    <p class="normal">The idea behind Copilot is that it learns from the code you and others have written and uses that knowledge to suggest new lines of code as you type.</p>
    <p class="normal1">How does <a id="_idIndexMarker048" class="calibre3"/>Copilot work? It uses machine learning to build a model of the code you and others have written and suggests the best text for you to use next. There are two parts of importance, the trained model and the so-called in-memory context. The model is trained on public repositories on GitHub and the context is something it assembles at runtime from looking at your files. Using the context and the underlying model, it provides you with text suggestions. Copilot uses some of the following to build its context (i.e., its in-memory capability that it uses together with the trained model to provide suggestions):</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Your active file</strong>: The code you’re working on.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Comments</strong>: Copilot uses comments to understand the context of your code.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Open files and your workspace</strong>: It not only looks at the code in your active file but also at the code in other files in your workspace.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Import statements</strong>: Even import statements are factored into Copilot’s suggestions.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">The underlying model and its training data</strong>: The code in public GitHub repositories constitutes the base of what it’s trained on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-58">Copilot capabilities and limits</h2>
    <p class="normal">So, what can<a id="_idIndexMarker049" class="calibre3"/> Copilot do? It can do a lot, but here’s a non-exhaustive list of capabilities:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Code completion</strong>: Copilot can complete lines of code for you.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Code generation</strong>: Copilot can generate whole functions for you.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Tests</strong>, <strong class="screentext">comments</strong>, <strong class="screentext">and</strong> <strong class="screentext">documentation</strong>: Copilot can generate tests, comments, and documentation for you.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Suggest improvements</strong>: Copilot can suggest improvements to your code. Improvements can come in many forms, from suggesting a better variable name or a better way to write a function to how to organize code better.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Translate code</strong>: Copilot can translate code from one language to another. For example, it can translate Python code to JavaScript code.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Answer questions</strong>: Copilot can answer questions about your code. For example, it can tell you what a function does or what a variable is used for, and answer questions about a domain such as “What is machine learning?”, for <a id="_idIndexMarker050" class="calibre3"/>example.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-59">Setup and installation</h2>
    <p class="normal">How can you get started? You can use Copilot from a variety of places and editors including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Codespaces, and GitHub’s web-based editor. In this chapter, we’ll use Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <h3 class="heading2" id="_idParaDest-60">Installing Copilot</h3>
    <p class="normal">To install <a id="_idIndexMarker051" class="calibre3"/>Copilot, you need to install the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code and also need to allow access.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Let’s review the steps in more detail (as outlined on the official Copilot docs page).</p>
    <p class="normal1">You can install the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or from within Visual Studio Code. We will show the latter here:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">In the <strong class="screentext">Extension: GitHub Copilot</strong> tab in Visual Studio Code, select <strong class="screentext">Install</strong>.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">If you have not previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, you will be prompted to sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">If you have previously authorized Visual Studio Code for your account on GitHub, GitHub Copilot will be automatically authorized.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">If you don’t get the prompt to authorize, select the bell icon in the bottom panel of the Visual Studio Code window.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">In your browser, GitHub will request the necessary permissions for GitHub Copilot. To approve these permissions, select <strong class="screentext">Authorize Visual Studio Code</strong>.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">To confirm the authentication, in Visual Studio Code, select <strong class="screentext">Open</strong> in the <strong class="screentext">Visual Studio Code</strong> dialog box.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1">Refer to this page if you have any problems getting Copilot to work: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot</span></a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-61">Getting started with Copilot</h2>
    <p class="normal">How do we<a id="_idIndexMarker052" class="calibre3"/> get started? Well, provided you have installed Copilot and there’s a Copilot icon in the bottom-right corner of your Visual Studio Code window, you’re good to go.</p>
    <p class="normal1">Here’s a suggestion to get started:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1">Create a new file in Visual Studio Code named <code class="inlinecode">app.js</code>.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Start typing the text prompt “Express web api with routes products and customers” as a comment at the top of the file like so, and press <em class="italic">Enter</em>:
        <pre class="programlisting1"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-comment">//Express web api with routes products and customers</span>
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Give it a few seconds and you should see a suggestion from Copilot as follows:
        <pre class="programlisting1"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> express = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'express'</span>);
</code></pre>
        <div class="packt_tip">
          <p class="normal1">If nothing appears, try pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Spacebar</em> to trigger a suggestion or start typing the start of the code, i.e., <em class="italic">const</em>, and wait for a suggestion to appear.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="4">You will have to press the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key to accept the suggestion. At this point, Copilot can keep generating code for you. To ensure it does, press <em class="italic">Enter</em> and watch as Copilot generates more code for you. Repeatedly press <em class="italic">Enter</em> and press <em class="italic">Tab</em> to accept the suggestions until you have code similar to the following:
        <pre class="programlisting1"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> app = <span class="hljs-meta">express</span>();
app.<span class="hljs-meta">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/products'</span>, <span>(</span><span>req, res</span><span>) =&gt;</span> {
  res.<span class="hljs-meta">send</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'products'</span>);
});
app.<span class="hljs-meta">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/customers'</span>, <span>(</span><span>req, res</span><span>) =&gt;</span> {
  res.<span class="hljs-meta">send</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'customers'</span>);
});
app.<span class="hljs-meta">listen</span>(<span class="hljs-attr">3000</span>, <span>() =&gt;</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attr">console</span>.<span class="hljs-meta">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Server listening on port 3000'</span>);
});
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Congratulations, you’ve just written your first lines of code with Copilot. Feel free to experiment with Copilot and try adding comments, so-called prompts, in the middle of your code and see what happens. Also, try varying the prompts <a id="_idIndexMarker053" class="calibre3"/>and see what happens.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-62">Assignment: improve the code</h2>
    <p class="normal">As an assignment, you’re <a id="_idIndexMarker054" class="calibre3"/>asked to improve the code generated by Copilot. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist">Add a route for the root of the web API.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Add a route for a specific product.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1">Add documentation for one of the routes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-63">Solution</h2>
    <p class="normal">Here’s a possible solution:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> express = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'express'</span>);

    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-64">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="normal">See if you can add a test for one of the routes.</p>
    <p class="normal1">In the next chapter, we will look at how to use Copilot in more detail. To use any AI assistant well, you need to understand how it works and how to use it. There’s a skill associated with using these tools well and it’s called prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the art of writing prompts, not only to make it understand your intentions but also to produce an output you’re happy with. It’s more than just writing a comment; you can instruct your AI assistant to solve something, apply a form of reasoning to it, and much more. The next chapter presents the central theme of this book, prompt engineering.</p>

    <h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-66">Understanding ChatGPT</h1>
    <p class="normal">ChatGPT, an <a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="calibre3"/>OpenAI development, is a specialized version of the GPT model designed to simulate human-like conversations. It excels in creating human-like text in dialogues, handling a variety of topics. It’s available for free at <a href="http://chat.openai.com" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">chat.openai.com</span></a>, with a premium ChatGPT Plus option (also known as GPT-4), and can draft essays, generate art prompts, and program code. The premium version offers enhanced features such as visual and audio input and output handling, file uploads, code execution, data visualization with select Python libraries, and customizable GPT capabilities. </p>
    <p class="normal1">You can access ChatGPT simply by visiting <a href="http://chat.openai.com" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">chat.openai.com</span></a> and creating an OpenAI account. It is also available as an app for both Android and iOS. More details can be found on the official <a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="calibre3"/>website (<a href="https://openai.com/" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">https://openai.com/</span></a>).</p>

    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-67">How does ChatGPT work?</h2>
    <p class="normal">ChatGPT, paralleling <a id="_idIndexMarker057" class="calibre3"/>Copilot’s code-oriented approach but in natural language processing, is adept at content generation, challenging traditional search engines. It excels in tasks such as essay writing and summarizing texts. The quality of ChatGPT’s responses heavily depends on the prompts it receives. </p>
    <p class="normal1">ChatGPT leverages extensive training data including books, websites, and a variety of textual sources for comprehensive language understanding. </p>
    <p class="normal1">It employs sophisticated machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning neural networks based on the Transformer architecture, to predict accurate and contextually relevant text responses. </p>
    <p class="normal1">ChatGPT’s contextual understanding is honed through advanced techniques, enabling it to interpret and respond to varying conversation threads intelligently. This approach mirrors the principles used in Copilot for code, adapted here for nuanced, human-like text interaction.</p>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-68">ChatGPT capabilities and limits</h2>
    <p class="normal">Capabilities of ChatGPT:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Content creation</strong>: Generates<a id="_idIndexMarker058" class="calibre3"/> creative content including marketing material, blog posts, stories, and poems</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Educational explanations</strong>: Offers detailed explanations on complex topics for educational purposes</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Coding assistance</strong>: Assists developers with code optimization, error debugging, and algorithm design</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Learning aid</strong>: Acts as a companion in online learning, offering real-time assistance and clarification of concepts</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Conversational AI</strong>: Enhances user experience in virtual assistants and chatbots through natural language interactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal1">Limitations and concerns of ChatGPT:</p>
    <ul class="calibre15">
      <li class="bulletlist"><strong class="screentext">Accuracy issues</strong>: ChatGPT <a id="_idIndexMarker059" class="calibre3"/>may generate responses with factual inaccuracies or biases from training data, also known as hallucinations. These outputs often emerge from the AI model’s inherent biases, lack of real-world understanding, or training data limitations. In other words, the AI system “hallucinates” information that it has not been explicitly trained on, leading to unreliable or misleading responses. Hence, users should always verify and validate the responses and should not use them blindly.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Ethical implications</strong>: Raises concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content for fraudulent activities or harmful information gathering.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Employment impact</strong>: Fear of AI replacing human jobs in certain sectors.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Security risks</strong>: Potential use in phishing, creating malware, and cybercriminal activities.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Data privacy</strong>: Concerns about the use of vast internet data in training, impacting user privacy.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Message cap: </strong>At the time of writing the book, GPT-4 was capped to offer a maximum of 40 responses over 3 hours.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">Limited Python libraries for code execution: </strong>The<strong class="screentext"> </strong>Code Interpreter and Advanced Data Analysis features of ChatGPT use limited sets of libraries, heavily featuring machine learning libraries but not such great support for other libraries, such as Keras or TensorFlow, required for deep learning.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading1" id="_idParaDest-69">Setup and installation</h2>
    <p class="normal">Setting up and installing <a id="_idIndexMarker060" class="calibre3"/>ChatGPT involves a few steps:</p>
    <ol class="calibre16">
      <li class="bulletlist1" value="1"><strong class="screentext">Create an OpenAI account</strong>: Visit the OpenAI website and sign up for an account.</li>
      <li class="bulletlist1"><strong class="screentext">API access</strong>: Developers need to obtain API access by applying on the OpenAI platform.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal1">For non-developers, using ChatGPT is as simple as visiting the ChatGPT website or installing the Android or iOS app and logging in with your OpenAI account. No installation is required for general use. For more detailed steps and information, please refer to OpenAI’s official documentation and website.</p>
