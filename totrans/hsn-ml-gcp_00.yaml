- en: Google Cloud ML Engine combines the services of Google Cloud Platform with the
    power and flexibility of TensorFlow. With this book, you will not only learn how
    to build and train different complexities of machine learning models at scale,
    but also to host them in the cloud to make predictions.

- en: This book is focused on making the most of the Google Machine Learning Platform
    for large datasets and complex problems. You will learn how to create powerful
    machine-learning-based applications from scratch for a wide variety of problems
    by leveraging different data services from the Google Cloud Platform. Applications
    include NLP, speech-to-text, reinforcement learning, time series, recommender
    systems, image classification, video content inference, and many others. We will
    implement a wide variety of deep learning use cases and will also make extensive
    use of data-related services comprising the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem, such
    as Firebase, Storage APIs, Datalab, and so forth. This will enable you to integrate
    machine learning and data processing features into your web and mobile applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and AI developers
    who want to learn Google Cloud Platform services to build machine learning applications.
    Since interaction with the Google ML platform is mostly done via the command line,
    the reader should have some familiarity with the bash shell and Python scripting.
    Some understanding of machine learning and data science concepts will also be
    handy.

- en: In this book, machine learning algorithms are implemented on the Google Cloud
    Platform. To reproduce the many examples in this book, you need to possess a working
    account on GCP. We have used Python 2.7 and above to build various applications.
    In that spirit, we have tried to keep all of the code as friendly and readable
    as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the
    code and readily use it in different scenarios.
