    and the services that it offers, such as **machine learning** (**ML**). Moreover,
    this chapter will provide detailed instructions on how to set up a data science
    and machine learning development environment on the IBM Cloud. Finally, we will
    conclude with a project example that involves loading and visualizing data.

    exciting? To start, the IBM Cloud platform (formerly known as **Bluemix**) actually
    combines **platform as a service** (**PaaS**) with **infrastructure as a service**
    (**IaaS**) and, in addition, offers a collection or catalog of cloud services
    that you can integrate with PaaS and IaaS to efficiently build individual, enterprise,
    or even global innovative applications.
