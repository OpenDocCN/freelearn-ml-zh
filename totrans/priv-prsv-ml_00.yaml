    Privacy Breaches, and Threat Modeling*, serves as an introduction to various aspects
    of data privacy. We begin by exploring the concept of data privacy and distinguishing
    between sensitive data and personal sensitive data. Additionally, we delve into
    the realm of data privacy regulations, highlighting their significance in safeguarding
    individuals’ information. The chapter also introduces the concept of privacy by
    design, emphasizing its importance in ensuring privacy throughout the data life
    cycle. Furthermore, we examine the real-world implications of privacy breaches
    by discussing notable cases and the resulting fines imposed on major enterprise
    companies. These examples shed light on the consequences of failing to protect
    sensitive data adequately. The chapter then delves into privacy threat modeling
    using the LINDDUN framework. We explain the concepts of linkability and identifiability
    threats, providing illustrative examples to enhance understanding. By covering
    these topics comprehensively, this chapter sets the foundation for a deeper exploration
    of privacy-preserving techniques and methodologies discussed throughout the book.
    It equips you with the necessary knowledge to understand the importance of data
    privacy, the risks associated with privacy breaches, and the strategies employed
