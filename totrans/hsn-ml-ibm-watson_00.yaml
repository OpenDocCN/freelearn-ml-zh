- en: This book starts with supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts,
    including an overview of IBM Cloud and the Watson Machine Learning service. You
    will learn how to run various techniques, such as k-means clustering, KNN, time
    series prediction, visual recognition, and text-to-speech in IBM Cloud by means
    of real-world examples. You will learn how to create a Spark pipeline in Watson
    Studio. The book will also guide you in terms of deep learning and neural network
    principles on IBM Cloud with TensorFlow. You will learn how to build chatbots
    using NLP techniques. Later, you will cover three powerful case studies – the
    facial expression classification platform, the automated classification of lithofacies,
    and the multibiometric identity authentication platform – with a view to becoming
    well-versed in the methodologies.

- en: '[Chapter 1](07c92a06-635f-41ef-b2be-3654ba90b790.xhtml), *Introduction to IBM
    Cloud*, provides a brief introduction to the IBM cloud platform and the machine
    learning service. Moreover, this chapter provides detailed instructions on how
    to set up data science and machine learning development environments on IBM Cloud.
    Finally, it conclude in with an example for loading and visualizing data.'

    – A Bag of Tricks*, provides a hands-on guide to extraction and the selection
    of features from real-life data, with an emphasis on the fact that practical machine
    learning systems are all about proper feature engineering. This chapter demonstrates
    best practices for feeding data to your machine learning algorithms. Moreover,
    it shows how to remove redundant data that negatively impacts the performance
    of your machine learning system. This chapter also introduces strategies for combining
    data from different sources.'

    Learning Models for Your Data*, acts as the backbone of the entire book. It provides
    a tour of the machine learning paradigm, with a focus on famous approaches and
    algorithms. This chapter starts by providing a practical background to model evaluation,
    model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning. Then it covers supervised
    learning, and discusses machine learning algorithms for regression problems. By
    the end of the chapter, you should be able to select proper supervised machine
    learning models for the data at hand.'

    Workouts on IBM Cloud*, provides several examples that are carefully designed
    to uncover the power of Python as a machine learning programming language of choice
    and the power of the machine learning service on the IBM Watson Studio platform.
    This chapter will enable you to practice proper feature engineering. Moreover,
    you will be able to run supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering)
    techniques in the cloud. Furthermore, this chapter will guide you on implementing
    time series prediction algorithms. Finally, it concludes with visual recognition
