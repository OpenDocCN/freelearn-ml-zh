I hope you have got a fair idea of how to build recommendation engines using various technologies such as R, Python, Mahout, Spark, and Neo4j. We have covered recommendation engines such as neighborhood recommendations, model-based content recommendations, and context-aware, scalable, real-time, graph recommendations.</p><p>I would like to touch upon two things in the concluding chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Technological shift and motivational shift driving the future of recommendation engines</li><li class="listitem">Popular methodologies for improving the quality of recommendation engines</li></ul></div><p>In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Future of recommendation engines</em></span> section, I will summarize one of my talks about recommendation engines in a tech conference held in 2015. In the <span class="emphasis"><em>good implementations</em></span> section, I will touch upon important methodologies to be followed while building recommendation engines.</p><p>With business organizations investing a lot in recommendation engines, researchers are freely exploring different aspects of recommendation engines and applying very advanced methods to improve their performance. It is very important for us to know the future of recommendation engines and the direction in which the research is moving so that we can apply these new techniques in our day-to-day work while building recommendation engines.</p><p>In the future of recommendation engines section, we will touch upon the technological and motivational shifts that are driving the future of recommendations. In the following section, we will learn about a few popular methodologies that every data scientist should know while building recommendation engines.</p><div class="section" title="Future of recommendation engines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec67"/>Future of recommendation engines</h1></div></div></div><p>As we have reached the end of the book, I feel it is time to talk about the future of recommendation engines. Let us first have a small recap of what we have covered so far in the book:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Recommendation engines in detail</li><li class="listitem">Data-mining techniques used in recommendation engines</li><li class="listitem">Collaborative filtering: similarity-based recommendations</li><li class="listitem">Model-based recommendations using R and Python</li><li class="listitem">Content-based recommender systems using R and Python</li><li class="listitem">Context-aware recommender systems using R and Python</li><li class="listitem">Scalable real-time recommender systems using Scala</li><li class="listitem">Scalable recommendation engines using Mahout</li><li class="listitem">Graph-based recommendation engines using Neo4j</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Phases of recommendation engines"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-27GQ62"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec68"/>Phases of recommendation engines</h1></div></div></div><p>As explained in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Recommendation Engines" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommendation Engines an Introduction</em></span>, if we look closely at the evolution of recommender systems, the recommendation engines have evolved in multiple directions; it is important to understand the directions in which recommendation engines are evolving to cope with futuristic situations.</p><p>We are heading into the third phase of evolution of recommendation engines, which are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Phase 1: General recommendation engines</li><li class="listitem">Phase 2: Personalized recommendation engines</li><li class="listitem">Phase 3: Futuristic recommendation engines</li></ul></div><p>Predominantly, recommendation engines focus on consumers. <span class="strong"><strong>Consumer</strong></span> is the central objective for recommendation engines. Let's understand how these systems are evolving with respect to users. With the increase in the usage of the Internet, everyday decisions, ranging from which products to buy to which movies to watch to which restaurants to try, have led to more and more trust being put in the hands of these recommendation systems. These recommendation systems are changing the way we make up our minds, guiding us through a new digital reality, the evolution of which is bringing us closer to exactly we want, even if we ourselves don't know it yet.</p><div class="section" title="Phase 1 - general recommendation engines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec111"/>Phase 1 - general recommendation engines</h2></div></div></div><p>These recommendation engines are the earlier generation of recommendation engines. Collaborative filtering, user-based recommenders, and item-based recommenders fall into this phase of general recommendations.</p><p>As explained in <a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Recommendation Engines Explained" href="part0022.xhtml#aid-KVCC1">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommendation Engines Explained</em></span>, the collaborative filtering recommenders have become very popular, and are also very effective at recommending things to users. The following figure is symbolic of general recommendation engines:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00483.jpeg" alt="Phase 1 - general recommendation engines"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div class="section" title="Phase 2 - personalized recommender systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec112"/>Phase 2 - personalized recommender systems</h2></div></div></div><p>As the information explosion started and more and more people started using the Web, leaving a good amount of digital footprints, such as search patterns, clicks, and browsing more and more, companies started looking into what, in the items or products, the user is interested in and which features of the items are making the user look for it. Companies started realizing that each person is unique and has unique tastes, and then they started catering to their need for personalized things; these are also called <span class="strong"><strong>content-based recommender systems</strong></span>. In<a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Recommendation Engines Explained" href="part0022.xhtml#aid-KVCC1"> Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommendation Engines Explained,</em></span> we learned about content-based recommenders in detail. The following figure shows how personalized recommendations are given to the customer:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00484.jpeg" alt="Phase 2 - personalized recommender systems"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As systems moved to personalized systems--known as content-based recommender systems--more advanced techniques using machine learning, big data, and the cloud started calculating items more suited to the users. Methods such as matrix factorizations, <span class="strong"><strong>Singular Value Decomposition</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SVD</strong></span>), and regression analysis started to be employed as technology evolved.</p><p>The aforementioned two methods have their own limitations to new data (the cold-start problem) and in narrowing down the information. To solve these problems, the ensemble or <span class="strong"><strong>hybrid recommender models</strong></span> evolved, which are formed by combining one or more algorithms to achieve more accuracy.</p><p>From here, we are moving into <span class="strong"><strong>deep neural nets</strong></span>, a very advanced level of neural-network algorithms stacked together in multiple layers, where feature engineering is being automated. One of the major difficult tasks in machine-learning models is to accurately engineer the features; so research is being done to apply deep-learning methods to recommendation engines.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>For more information, refer to the following websites:</p><p>

Ubiquitous recommenders start recommending things in real time based on your location, time, mood, sleep cycle, and energy output. The following figure depicts a futuristic system:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00486.jpeg" alt="Phase 3 - futuristic recommender systems"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This means that where ever you go and whatever you do, the recommender systems will be watching you and will be recommending things on the go. Google, Facebook, and other major IT giants have pioneered these recommender systems and have nearly perfected them and started delivering these ubiquitous recommender systems. <span class="emphasis"><em>Google Allo</em></span> from Google is one example of a ubiquitous recommender system:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00487.jpeg" alt="Phase 3 - futuristic recommender systems"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Till now, we were getting recommendations based on some bucketing, users or items, but the future will be more tailor-made to users based on the digital footprints available. <span class="emphasis"><em>Google Allo</em></span> is one of the best available apps, which continuously monitors you, and based on your activity on the app, it will definitely be recommending things on the go in the future. <span class="emphasis"><em>Google Allo</em></span> is chat environment, which works as virtual assistant, assisting us with all our queries, which in turn will learn our preferences and interests over time and make smart suggestions on the go.</p><p>This is how real-time context-aware recommender systems also fall into this type of futuristic recommenders:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00488.jpeg" alt="Phase 3 - futuristic recommender systems"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We are almost in a digitized world, where we are relying on the Internet for almost everything, be it related to banking, healthcare, driving cars, restaurants, travelling, personal fitness, and so on. In the near future, all companies would share information about users among themselves to create 360-degree user profiles using all the aforementioned digital footprints, and personalized, real-time, context-aware recommendations will be catered to with great accuracy. In the preceding figure, we can see how we are leaving our digital footprints and how it is possible for companies to share data with one another to generate recommendations tailored at individual levels.</p><p>There have been shifts in motivation, which are driving the evolution of recommendation engines toward futuristic systems. A few of them are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">End of search</li><li class="listitem">Leaving the Web behind</li><li class="listitem">Emerging from the Web</li></ul></div><p>Since the advent of recommendation engines, the primary focus is on customers, and even for the futuristic recommender systems, this remains the same, but the difference comes in with the increase in the number of digital footprints users are leaving. This large amount of usage of digital systems is leading customers to ask for more sophisticated solutions to make the access to information more personal than generic.</p><div class="section" title="End of search"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec40"/>End of search</h3></div></div></div><p>We are moving away from traditional ways of searching and web integration toward information and content discovery. Future search engines will be using a convergence theory of web <span class="emphasis"><em>search/personalization/ads</em></span>, which will allow users to move into content discovery though recommendations rather than searches. The following figure shows convergence theory:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00489.jpeg" alt="End of search"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>With more and more people relying on the Internet or search engines to find suitable products online, organizations are working together by sharing the data from users' online activity from different platforms, with the objective of minimizing the number of searches to find relevant information or content by generating accurate personalized recommendations based on recent activities.</p><p>I call this paradigm the <span class="strong"><strong>convergence theory,</strong></span> where traditional search, ads, and recommendation engines are combined together to bring relevant content discovery to users at a personalized level by bringing an end to searching on the Internet.</p><p>For example, the Google search engine and YouTube have already started working toward this convergence theory to help users find relevant information on products and perform content discovery without searching explicitly.</p><p>Recently, I was looking for the Raspberry Pi 3, the latest in the series of credit-card-sized single-board computers, on an e-commerce site, to buy it for my personal work. A few days later, when I was searching for the specifications of the Raspberry Pi on Google Search, I noticed that Google had displayed ads related to the Raspberry Pi. Though alarming, it was more convenient for me because it had eliminated the task of going to the e-commerce site exclusively for purchasing. The search results are displayed in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00490.jpeg" alt="End of search"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We can take YouTube as an example. The suggestions on YouTube are becoming more and more relevant, so much so that the number of times we search for required information is getting less and less; we follow the suggestions that are recommended to get more information on related topics.</p><p>In the future, we will see more and more applications making use of this convergence theory to minimize the number of searches by users, and also of recommendation engines for personalized content discovery.</p></div><div class="section" title="Leaving the Web behind"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec41"/>Leaving the Web behind</h3></div></div></div><p>Search engines and recommender systems are employed to enrich social experience as well as user experience by reaching out to the customers. More futuristic systems will continuously listen to their customers online and address their grievances at the earliest opportunity, even when their displeasure is being expressed on social sites. The following figure shows the motivation for futuristic recommendations - leaving the Web behind:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00491.jpeg" alt="Leaving the Web behind"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As an example, imagine you have expressed displeasure about your recent flight experience over Twitter by tagging the flight's official Twitter account; efforts will be made to listen to these concerns and reach out to customers personally to solve their problems. In addition to that, they may also please their customers with more personalized offers.</p><p>In the future, this approach may be followed by all organizations to listen to their customers' grievances or feedback on social platforms and reach out to customers with good recommendations or offers, which might be beneficial to both parties.</p></div><div class="section" title="Emerging from the Web"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec42"/>Emerging from the Web</h3></div></div></div><p>New paradigms are evolving, such as Internet television replacing traditional television. Those times are gone when people had to wait to see their favorite programs at a predefined hour; instated people would wish to watch programs at a convenient time. Now times have changed; we are watching episodes at a time convenient to us on the Internet.</p><p>This change in the mindsets of people made business houses redesign their business models to increase their profits. For example, all the episodes of the Netflix series <span class="emphasis"><em>House of Cards</em></span> were released together, breaking away from the traditional approach of one episode a week, which was a tremendous success and made other production houses follow suit.</p><p>The emergence of such business models is a result of the analysis of the viewing patterns of people.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the <span class="emphasis"><em>House of Cards</em></span> series is that the producers of <span class="emphasis"><em>House of Cards</em></span>, Netflix, made use of big data analytics to analyze and understand the viewing patterns of its large user base, came up with a story comprising all the ingredients that viewers would love, and made a TV series. When it was released, the series was an instant hit.</p><p>This approach has made its way into other organizations to come up with more creations in order to improve customer experience.</p><p>As a result of the aforementioned shift in the motivation of recommendations, the context of recommendations is changing. Different people need different things at different times, with different people. The following figure depicts what was explained earlier:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00492.jpeg" alt="Emerging from the Web"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>A person going on a vacation with family might have a set of requirements that is contradictory to the set of requirements for when the person is going on a vacation with friends. Similarly, the same person may have different requirements at the same time in two different places. For example, a person travelling for business purposes to many countries might have different requirements, as per the local conditions. A person who is in a tropical country may need cotton dresses, and the same person may need woollen dresses when in cold countries. The difference in preferences is elaborated in the following figure, where we can see different people, in different countries, with different people, at different times, wearing different dresses:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00493.jpeg" alt="Emerging from the Web"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The futuristic recommender systems will continuously and actively listen to their users to cater to their requirements on the go.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Next best actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec114"/>Next best actions</h2></div></div></div><p>Another type of futuristic recommender system would be the systems that are sophisticated enough to predict your next move and make relevant suggestions without you asking explicitly.</p><p>TARS, from the movie <span class="emphasis"><em>Interstellar,</em></span> could be a reality soon, which may suggest the next best actions a human should take by considering all the information surrounding the person.</p><p>Though TARS would be the most sophisticated system, humanoid robots, which are already a reality, might work as the first-generation next-best-action prediction agents.</p></div><div class="section" title="Use cases to look out for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec115"/>Use cases to look out for</h2></div></div></div><p>In this section, we will list a few promising use cases that might make you more interested in future of recommendation engines. Let's look at some good use cases for ubiquitous futuristic recommendations.</p><div class="section" title="Smart homes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec43"/>Smart homes</h3></div></div></div><p>IoT and recommender systems together form a very powerful combination to bring about futuristic recommendation engines. A fully digitized smart home would be the best use case, where in the future, your refrigerator may suggest your monthly grocery list on your mobile while you are at work, as in following image. Similarly, IoT-enabled recommendation engines are something to be watched out for in the future:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00494.jpeg" alt="Smart homes"/><div class="caption"><p>Pic credits: http://walyou.com/smart-home-gadgets/</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div class="section" title="Healthcare recommender systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec44"/>Healthcare recommender systems</h3></div></div></div><p>Healthcare recommender systems form one of most exciting areas we have to watch out for. Researchers are focusing on how we can bring personalized healthcare to common people using advanced analytics. For instance, researchers at the University of Notre Dame have developed a system called <span class="strong"><strong>Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CARE</strong></span>), which uses a simple collaborative filtering that finds similar patients based on similarity of symptoms and generates probable risk profiles for individuals.</p><p>Consider the case of Proteus Digital Health Company, which uses an IoT-enabled device, an ingestible sensor, to track medical adherence. The device detects medication intake, tracks physiological data, and alerts the patient if he has skipped the tablet by mistake.</p></div><div class="section" title="News as recommendations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec45"/>News as recommendations</h3></div></div></div><p>If you observe Google News, you can see that a recommendation engine is working behind the scenes, continuously monitoring your click patterns, and combined with what is trending around you, a content-based personalized recommendation engine starts recommending news tailored for you:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00495.jpeg" alt="News as recommendations"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Taking a leaf from this application's book, many new companies, such as Reddit and Rigg, among others, are using recommendation engines to suggest news items or articles as recommendations.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Popular methodologies" id="aid-28FAO1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec69"/>Popular methodologies</h1></div></div></div><p>In earlier chapters, we have seen various recommendation engines. In this section, we touch upon a few popular methodologies, which are actively been employed in building recommendation engines for improving the robustness and relevance of the recommendations, such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Serendipity</li><li class="listitem">Temporal aspects</li><li class="listitem">A/B testing</li><li class="listitem">Feedback mechanism</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Serendipity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec116"/>Serendipity</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the drawbacks of recommendation engines is that the recommendation engine will push us to a corner where the items to be suggested or discovered will be entirely based on what we have looked for in the past or what we are currently looking for:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00496.jpeg" alt="Serendipity"/><div class="caption"><p>Credits: neighwhentheyrun</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>They work just the way horse blinkers work: they protect the horse from getting distracted from their path. The more interactions we have on the website, the narrower and closer to the users' profiles the recommendations tend to be. Is this wrong? No, absolutely not, but this is not how life works. If we turn back, most of the best discoveries of the past were made by chance. Surprises add spice to one's life. The amount of joy we get when we unexpectedly find something we need cannot be expressed in words. This feature is missing in the current paradigm of accuracy-oriented recommender systems.</p><p>By introducing serendipity and surprise to our recommender systems, we can reduce the aforementioned limitation. How do we introduce serendipity in the recommender systems?</p><p>Google News, before generating personalized news-article recommendations, will combine the trending news within a region or country. This enables users to get more news, which is trending around them, and they will also become interested in such news.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Temporal aspects of recommendation engines" id="aid-29DRA1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec70"/>Temporal aspects of recommendation engines</h1></div></div></div><p>Consider the following scenario: a lady purchases items or looks for items related to pregnancy for almost 9 months. After the delivery of the baby, she will start looking for items related to a newborn. Our recommendation engines should be intelligent enough to capture this information, and as soon as the lady starts looking for items for newborns, the recommendation engine should remove the recommendations related to pregnancy as they are no longer relevant.</p><p>The following image shows how the non-inclusion of temporal aspects of recommendation engines still recommends romantic books to a recently-turned monk:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00497.jpeg" alt="Temporal aspects of recommendation engines"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Our choices are very time-specific; we may not like the things that we like today in the future. This aspect of time is often not considered while designing a recommendation engine. Our recommender systems capture every interaction of the user and accumulate large user preferences over a particular period. Since temporal information is inherent in user preferences, it is reasonable for a data scientist to exploit the temporal information to improve the relevance of the recommendation engine. A simple way of handling the temporal aspect is to give more weight to the most recent interactions, and less weight to old interactions while generating recommendations.</p><div class="section" title="A/B testing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec117"/>A/B testing</h2></div></div></div><p>What is the most important thing for any data scientist? The accuracy of the machine-learning model we have built to solve the problem at hand. How do we ensure whether the model is right or not? We usually perform evaluation metrics, most likely the cross-validation approach and error/evaluation metrics while building the model, to check model accuracy before deploying the model to production. Though we apply best practices while building a model, such as <span class="strong"><strong>RMSE</strong></span>, precision-recall and cross-validation approaches, which you learned about in previous chapters, are evaluated on historical data. Once the model is deployed in production, only then do we come to know how good the model's performance is. Usually, there isn't a single solution for a problem.</p><p>While designing a recommendation engine, we should always keep in mind the following things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">A way to evaluate the model's performance at real time</li><li class="listitem">Always use multiple models for generating recommendations, and choose the model best suited for the user groups</li></ul></div><p>The following shows how a simple A/B testing mechanism can be deployed in a production scenario:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00498.jpeg" alt="A/B testing"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>A/B testing comes to the rescue. In A/B testing, different sets of recommendations will be sent to different sets of users, and the performance of the recommendations will be evaluated at real time over a period. Though costly, A/B testing is an effective testing method to evaluate models in real time.</p></div><div class="section" title="Feedback mechanism"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec118"/>Feedback mechanism</h2></div></div></div><p>Having spoken about A/B testing evaluating the performance of the recommender systems at real-time, it is very important to design the recommender systems to include a feedback mechanism. This is done to send back to the user interactions on the recommendations generated to fine-tune the model features included during model creation.</p><p>One simple approach to include the feedback mechanism is discussed as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00499.jpeg" alt="Feedback mechanism"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Recall the content-based approach we used to generate recommendations. In the content-based approach, all the features are given equal weight. But we should be aware that not all features will be contributing equally to the recommendation model. To increase the accuracy of the model, we should enable a mechanism to calculate feature weights. Introduce a feedback mechanism to capture the user interactions on the recommendations, and then use this information to build a classification model to calculate the model feature weights.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary" id="aid-2ACBS1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec71"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we saw how recommendation engines are evolving and the motivations that are affecting the evolution of recommender systems, followed by a few potential use cases to watch out for. Finally, we touched upon some good methodologies, which should be considered before designing a recommender system. With this input, I'm sure that you are now equipped to confront the requirements of building future-ready recommendation engines which are self-learning, scalable, real-time, and futuristic. As mentioned in this chapter, deep learning can play a very important role in building more futuristic recommender systems.</p></div></body></html>
