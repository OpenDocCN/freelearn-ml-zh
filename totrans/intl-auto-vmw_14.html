<p>This chapter will brief you about how <strong>Software-defined Data Centers</strong> (<strong>SDDC</strong>) can span across multiple data centers and into hybrid service providers, independent of physical infrastructure with distributed data and applications. Digital transformation is changing the mode of business, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) plays a critical part in this transformation. Business growth is accelerating and exploring better ways to bring new products and services to market quickly with a modern data center that can provide the agility, security, and scalability required to power innovation and growth. We will learn about the core requirements that customers are looking for in IoT implementation. </p>
<p>We will learn about why IoT is so critical for health, research, science, and retail customers as their application and data will be utilized from data center to cloud to edge devices. We will also look at the transformation of networking for IoT by understanding how to manage/process massive data across edge devices, along with VMware Pulse IoT use cases across different verticals.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoT and ML</li>
<li>IoT need hybrid cloud to be managed beyond regional boundaries</li>
<li>Distributed networking </li>
<li>Security with the virtual cloud network</li>
<li>VMware Pulse IoT Center</li>
</ul>

<p>IoT use cases exist in most industries. They may not be apparent to us, and they may not even be apparent to customers. IoT is a tool, and businesses use this tool to achieve better outcomes. They are consistent when dealing with outcomes which depend on the IoT tool as the pattern: <em>Ingest</em>, <em>analyze</em>, and <em>engage</em>. An IoT solution <em>ingests</em> data from sensors and devices, the analytics component then uses this data to arrive at conclusions (<em>analyze</em>), and the results trigger actions that allow the business to <em>engage</em> with the infrastructure or their customer.</p>
<p><em>Ingest</em>, <em>analyze</em>, <em>engage</em> is used by businesses to constantly improve their products and services; this active or passive feedback could be coming from humans, computers, trucks, or assembly lines. IoT use cases observed in the market can be divided into three high-level IT value-management goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous customer engagement</li>
<li>Digital engagement</li>
<li>New business model</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go through some of these use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment adherence would allow care facilities to monitor whether patients are following their treatment plans by using smart pill boxes</li>
<li>Smart inspections in insurance <span>allows the inspection of damages using drones and image recognition</span></li>
<li>Mining companies use of predictive maintenance <span>to schedule preventative maintenance of heavy infrastructure, since maintenance impacts productivity immediately</span></li>
<li>Imagine getting a new sports driving mode for your car, just like you can buy an app in the Apple Store or Google Play Store—that's what software feature delivery <span>can enable in the automotive space</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Driving risk-based pricing for automobile insurance <span><span>enables an insurance company to price insurance per individual driving habits, as measured by devices tethered to the car's onboard computer</span></span></li>
<li>Automated checkouts, <span>as being trialed by Amazon and Wal-Mart, allows customers to shop without the lines</span></li>
<li>Smart cities <span>have been in the news in the recent past. These enable efficient energy consumption and safer roads</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Ingest, analyze, engage is evident in every use case.</p>

<p>VMware Pulse IoT Center is a secure, enterprise-grade IoT device-management and monitoring solution. You can onboard, manage, monitor, and secure IoT use cases from the edge to the cloud, bridge the gap between IT and <strong>Operational Technology</strong> (<strong>OT</strong>) organizations, and simplify IoT device management with Pulse IoT Center. Liota Agent, on edge systems, enables data orchestration, automatically detects edge systems, and onboards and provisions <strong>Over-the-Air</strong> (<strong>OTA</strong>) by mapping edge systems to connected devices. It collects telemetry data about infrastructure health and detects anomalies in real-time with high accuracy. It manages software OTA of any edge type along with connected end points, by configuring rules to upgrade in flexible package combination.</p>
<p>It provides security across IoT things, network, data, and people by creating segmented data flows with network virtualization that offers a complete visibility of all things. We have to first discover customer pain points which create hindrance in their business growth and also slow down their overall process.</p>

<p>The OVA is basically a vApp that contains three <strong>virtual machines</strong> (<strong>VMs</strong>) that run the Ubuntu server. The VMs are named, by default, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>mqttbroker</kbd>: This has the EMQTT broker from <kbd>http://emqtt.io</kbd> installed</li>
<li><kbd>iceapi</kbd>: This has the VWware Pulse IoT API and PostgreSQL pre-installed</li>
<li><kbd>iceconsole</kbd>: This has VMware Pulse IoT Console with all dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>During deployment, the OVAs will need some application-specific properties to help initialize itself. These properties are basically used to configure the applications in each of the VMs. </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Deploying and configuring the OVA</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The OVA can be deployed through vSphere using the <span class="packt_screen">Deploy OVF Template</span> from the vSphere UI or using the OVF Tool from the command line. Before powering on the VM for the first time, make sure that Guest OS Customization is enabled for the host to inject the right system and network settings for each of the guest OSes.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The Guest OS Customization Wizard is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4470fa04-1367-4627-bd0f-c32aedd0fbf8.png"/></p>
<p>The deployment will also ask for a few properties to help the appliance configure itself to a certain extent. Add an EMQTT credential (username, password) so that the broker starts up with this pre-staged user once the VM starts up for the very first time. This is not a system user but an EMQTT user that the clients can use to connect to the broker. Only one username and password can be configured over this option. Any additional users will have to be created from the command line after logging into the <kbd>mqttbroker</kbd> VM<strong>.</strong> The username and password should be between 8 and 64 characters. It is advised you keep the username purely alphanumeric. This password is not used for any built-in Linux user accounts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the wizard asks for passwords for the IoT API and IoT Console. The password for the IoT API will be used to secure the DB and the generated certificates. The password for the IoT Console is used for the generated certificates alone. The username and password should be between 8 and 64 characters. It is advised you keep the username purely alphanumeric. This password is not used to for any built-in Linux user accounts.</p>
<p>We can use VMWare Pulse IoT API and Console as input to generate SSL certificates by taking the public DNS name for the MQTT broker. These values are used during certificate generation. The name goes into both the CN and SAN sections of the generated SSL certificate. Therefore, it is necessary to freeze the domain names before proceeding with the deployment in case you need to continue using the server with a self-signed certificate.</p>
<p>As an example, here are the features of the following deployment:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">EMQTT user name</span> and password are <kbd>vmwareiot</kbd> and <kbd>vmwareiot</kbd></li>
<li>The IoT API password for the DB and certificates</li>
<li>The IoT Console password for the certificates</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Public FQDN of the EMQTT server</span>: <kbd>demoemqtt.vmwpulse.com</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Public FQDN of the VMware Pulse API server</span>: <kbd>demoapi.vmwpulse.com</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Public FQDN of the VMware Pulse IoT Console server</span>: <kbd>democonsole.vmwpulse.com</kbd></li>
<li>The time zone settings can be left as the default</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The configuration settings through the <span class="packt_screen">Import Wizard</span> are shown here:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/163f84ef-c92f-4720-b3e7-4281f4a5b101.png"/></p>
<p>We will learn about the installation and configuration of products specific to the Pulse IoT Center. The deployment would need to be done in the following order to address dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>VMware Pulse Device Management Suite</li>
<li>VROPs Suite with Helix Adapter Support</li>
<li>EMQTT broker</li>
<li>VMware Pulse IoT Center Console (UI)</li>
<li>VMware Pulse IoT Center API server</li>
<li>vIDM for <strong>Single Sign-On</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>) support</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Before the VMware Pulse IoT Center components are deployed, make sure all computing and networking resources are available in the deployment infrastructure, be it VMware OneCloud or the VMware vCenter. The OVAs do not have the firewalls or iptables rules enabled by default, and are left to the deployment team in case additional security reinforcements or hardenings are needed. </p>

<p><kbd>projectice</kbd> is a standard Linux user with no <kbd>sudo</kbd> privileges and is used to run the VMware Pulse IoT Center components. The VMware Pulse IoT Center console, Hazelcast, and VMware Pulse IoT Center API server run as system services under this account. The service runs as a daemon to support an automatic restart in the event of a system reboot. No password has been set for this account and, hence, a local login is only possible using <kbd>sudo</kbd> or <kbd>su</kbd> through another logged-in session. This user is limited to the VMs of the Pulse IoT API and the VMs of Pulse IoT Console. The EMQTT broker VM doesn't have this user. The root account exists as well, for which the default password is <kbd>vmware</kbd>. All default passwords will need to be changed on the first login. </p>
<p>The following prerequisites are required prior to installation:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SSL certificates.</li>
<li>Valid domain names for the API, console servers, and EMQTT broker. The name should be reflected in the common name and SAN of the SSL certificate.</li>
<li>Enable <span class="packt_screen">Guest OS Customization</span> on the VMs before starting the VM to ensure that the VM is configured with the right hostname and network settings.</li>
<li>VM hosting environments, such as vCloud or vSphere.</li>

<p><kbd>iceadmin</kbd> is an admin user that has <kbd>sudo</kbd> privileges and is mainly meant for configuration and management of VMware Pulse IoT Center components. The VMware Pulse IoT Center components are generally system services and the <kbd>iceadmin</kbd> account will be used to install/start/stop/restart the services as the situation demands.

<p>This section should be configured only after the IoT API server has been installed. The VMware Pulse IoT API registers for notifications from VMware Pulse Device Management Suite to speed up refreshing the resources, rather than relying on the sync interval. This helps the Pulse IoT API to maintain resources to a reasonable accuracy. These notifications are sent from VMware Pulse Device Management Suite to the Pulse IoT API whenever one of the following events happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new device is enrolled</li>
<li>A device is unenrolled</li>
<li>A device changes its organization group</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>VMware Pulse Device Management Suite and the Pulse IoT API honor the device's attribute change notification, such as asset number, device-friendly name, organization group ID, user email address, ownership, OS, phone number, or device MCC, only when the device's attribute-change flag is enabled in the events section.<strong> </strong>VMware Pulse Device Management Suite only supports organization group changes, which is done within the same OG tree, that is, in its child OGs. The event for the same is notified to the listener after some time.</p>
<p>While installing the Pulse Device Management Suite console in a Windows server, the VMware Pulse Device Management Suite installer suggests you enable TLSv1.2. Make sure to enable TLSv1.2, or, if the step is missed, perform the manual steps as outlined previously. Always confirm the following key is persisted in the registry. This is a mandatory registry entry for the device notifications to be notified to the VMware Pulse IoT API server.</p>
<p>Check out the following registry keys in the Pulse Device Management Suite physical server:</p>
<pre>"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols<br/> TLS 1.2 Client"<br/> Value name : DisabledByDefault<br/> Type : DWORD (32-bit) value<br/> Value : 0<br/> Value name : Enabled<br/> Type : DWORD (32-bit) value<br/> Value : 1</pre>
<p>Use this registry file to create the settings in the registry if they are missing. Just right-click the file on the Windows server as an admin user and choose merge. If the Pulse IoT API is installed using a self-signed certificate, make sure to add the root CA certificate of the self-signed certificate in the <span class="packt_screen">Windows System Certificate</span> stored under <span class="packt_screen">Trusted Root Certificates</span> on the machine where Pulse Device Management Suite is installed as per the following steps:</p>
<ol>

<p>This will help the SSL validation to succeed when Pulse Device Management Suite makes an SSL call into the Pulse IoT API to deliver notifications. Just adding the certificates will not allow the SSL invocation to succeed, unless the hostname used by the VMware Pulse Device Management Suite API to reach Pulse IoT API matches with the actual certificate configured for the Pulse IoT API service.</p>
<p>VMware Pulse Device Management Suite needs to reach out to the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>The VMware Pulse IoT API server, to send notifications</li>
<li>VIDM (if configured)</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>VMware Pulse</span></span> system, if available through an internal route from the Windows VM, adds an alias in the <kbd>%SystemRoot%\drivers\etc\hosts</kbd> file to either of the machines that are using the external DNS name to avoid a round trip. The DNS name is important for the SSL validation to happen, as each of these servers is invoked over HTTPS.</p>
<p>A custom-built version of the VMware Pulse operational analytics backend, based on VROPs 6.6, can be downloaded from the link in the IOT release artifacts. To log into the VM, the default password for the root user will be empty. Hence, just press <em>Enter</em> and set a new password on first login. This login should happen from the Terminal console where the OVA is deployed. SSH is disabled by default. Once deployed and powered on, access the vROPs instance web UI at <kbd>https://&lt;IP-address&gt;</kbd>, which will guide you through the basic installation steps of vROps. You can select <span class="packt_screen">Install/ Express Installation</span> and provide a password for the vROps instance. You will need to obtain a license key to use vROPs. </p>

<p>The primary motivation for businesses to consider and implement IoT solutions is to improve business productivity and internal efficiency by identifying customer-specific IoT use cases. When considering IoT use cases, we focus on quantifiable goals to show an improvement in productivity and efficiency. Anywhere we notice data being produced, we have the capacity for data ingestion. This may be a problem that hasn’t yet been addressed and, therefore, the business hasn’t done anything with the data. However, when we observe an opportunity to ingest data, we should think about analyzing that data and engaging using results from that with customers or with infrastructure.</p>
<p>Onboard the Liota agent on edge systems to enable data orchestration, automatically detect edge systems and onboard and provision OTA, and map edge systems to connected devices. We can monitor and collect telemetry data about infrastructure health, detect anomalies in real-time with high accuracy, and set rules to automatically fix OTA whenever possible.</p>

<p>IoT traffic differs and data centers <span><span>network</span></span> traffic as communication becomes digital and control instances become communication hubs from from on-premise data center to clouds. </p>
<p>There are three new areas of massive horizontal (east/west) traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-edge</strong>: That is, a LAN connecting vending machines</li>
<li><strong>Intra-DCs</strong>: Between different apps, storage, and DBs for various purposes (billing, analytics, control)</li>
<li><strong>Inter-DCs</strong>: Interaction between apps of different customers in data centers (order, manufacture, ship)</li>
</ul>
<p>Traffic with new paths and new content has massive east/west sensitive private data, and today's applications are dispersed to hundreds of either identical (load sharing) or complementary (process chain) instances while every set of data collections will be processed multiple times (over time) by different applications across the data centers. Their east/west traffic is highly dynamic as app instances come and go. These apps get frequently updated with most of the sensitive data processed and stored. We should prepare ourselves to prevent, detect, and contain breaches in a highly dynamic environment.</p>
<p>We can apply below policies and proactive actions to avoid any security breaches :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed firewall (DFW)</strong>:<strong> </strong>Micro segmentation to protect and filter every instance individually at its interface. People can’t harm what they can't touch.</li>
<li><strong>Guest introspection</strong>:<strong> </strong>Observe data and behavior in every instance to detect data leakage or dormant malware by spotting the <span>symptoms</span> and preventing its execution.</li>
<li><strong>Network introspection</strong>:<strong> </strong>Observe network traffic on layer 7 in mid-air to protect valuable data, and protect instances by turning out pockets when crossing levels. As we are evolving our data center from a shopping mall into a jail, we have to automate or fail the whole process with automation by one engine to gain and sustain coherence.</li>
<li><strong>Automate remediation</strong>: We find breached instance and distributed firewall quarantines it immediately b<span>y doing g</span>uest introspection.</li>
<li><strong>Automate coherent perspective</strong>: Allow OPS to have holistic views across silos from declarative perspectives.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can deploy logical firewall at every vNIC by decoupling network and security. Firewall instances at every vNIC to any kind of vSwitch embedded in the hypervisor as close as possible to the guest VM but not part of the guest VM. We won't move the traffic from the source to an inspection point, but instead move the inspection point to the source of the traffic with network infrastructure irrelevant to the granular protection of servers.</p>
<p>Distributed Firewall at vNIC is the right spot, and fully integrated to apply policies most effectively. Integrated means that it doesn't matter where we are or where we go—even if we are off the track or change direction—it still works because it is built into hypervisor. Integrated also means that it is not our responsibility as a driver or passenger to put on our protection, we can't forget or avoid it because it is built into hypervisor. Integrated also means it is physically and functionally integrated with some sensors and will set off the air-bags at the right time. NSX DFW define automation with Service Composer by abstracting and automating based on vCenter/active directory rulesets.</p>

<p>Dynamic sources of data represent conditions and changes of the system and abstraction layer will define on a higher level to respond to conditions and changes. We use vCenter and active directory to represent information about the servers and users in a specific solution. Service Composer in the NSX manager dynamically translates service definitions and FW rules into interface rule sets and pushes them down.</p>
<p>We own the vCenter with the necessary data for abstraction. NSX DFW Service Composer helps customers react immediately to changes and declares the strategy with every imperative, tactical move. The admin cannot remotely control the actions of each individual component, but instead they define a strategy—a set of abstract rules and measures—to control and follow the compliance policy:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fda2a7e1-9059-4401-b583-c28a7985ce19.png"/></p>
<p>The controller in turn is responsible for translating the strategy into tactical moves and orchestrating them and keeping oversight as they are especially responsible for changing tactics immediately when the situation changes. Each component in the data center plays its individual role, which is assigned by the controller. We should automate inter-data-center traffic and all N/S traffic as well, from the perspective of the local data center or, inter-data-center traffic which is N/S traffic.</p>
<p>Automating the local data center is pointless if deployments or changes are kept from going live ASAP by the necessary changes of N/S FW ruleset. The N/S Firewall could consume the VMware objects in their rules, as these objects would be dynamic and wouldn't touch the ruleset of the N/S firewall for daily changes when an instance comes or goes. NSX security groups can be dynamically consumed by third-party firewalls that automate changes to their ruleset objects.</p>

<p>Physical perspective is hard to manage and needs logical, coherent operations across DCs. The local feed of on-premise data centers is probably not big and redundant enough to scale compute which we can spread out across multiple data centers.</p>
<p>IoT-ready data centers must follow specific security and scalability practices as more N/S (<span>and E/W) </span>traffic comes into the data center. We also need more inter-data-center traffic for third party tool integration to achieve the below objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Micro-segmentation</li>

<li>Integrated automation</li>
<li>Distributed scaling</li>

<p>The IoT space opens many new doors to places where federation solutions can offer unique value. IoT comes in many forms, such as smart thermostat, a wearable medical device that monitors a patient’s vital metrics, or a smart vending machine that remembers favorite drinks. The IoT is where the cyber world meets the physical world. Any IoT solution requires some combination of connectivity, mobile communication, management, infrastructure, and security with an application's life cycle.</p>
<p>Customers need an infrastructure on which they can build an IoT solution; then they need to provision and manage millions of things on that infrastructure. Those things spit out massive data, so customers also need to collect, store, and analyze data, gain meaningful insights from it, and then translate those insights into worthwhile actions. We do this by providing the IoT essentials, which enable us to achieve three top-line business outcomes. </p>
<p>Following are the three business objectives :</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage millions of things as easily as managing one</li>
<li>Use things related data into action</li>
<li>Make IoT a business reality</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to leverage shared storage in modern big data platforms by evaluating current in-memory big data platforms. We will explore how <span><span>Big Data application ( such as Hadoop )</span></span> fits for virtualization as an in-memory feature of these platforms, to make them less dependent on I/O and storage protocols, so we can leverage virtualized shared storage and the basic VMware vSphere features to design a highly-available and performance-oriented architecture for big data platforms.</p>
