    for online machine learning called River. Online machine learning is a part of
    machine learning in which models are designed in such a way that they can update
    their learned model on the reception of any new data point.

    the regular machine learning that you are probably already aware of. In general,
    in machine learning, a model will try to learn a mathematical rule that can perform
    a certain task. This task is learned on the basis of a number of data points.
    The mathematics behind these tasks is based on statistics and algorithmics.

    build the model once, deploy it, and use it for predicting your input stream.
    You can probably track the performance metrics of your model, and when the performance
    starts to change, you can do an update or retraining of your model, deploy the
    new version, and let it set in the production environment as long as it works.

    that work very differently. They do not learn a full dataset at once, but rather,
    update the learned model (the decision rules for prediction) through sequential
    steps. Using such an approach, you can automatically update your model that is
    in production; it continues to learn on new data.

- en: The practice of building online learning systems takes a different angle at
    the machine learning problem than the offline machine learning approach. With
    offline learning, there is a real possibility to test what a model has learned,
    whereas, for online learning systems, this can change at any moment.

- en: For some use cases, it is impossible to use offline learning. An example is
    forecasting use cases. In general, for forecasting, you predict a value in the
    future. To do so, you use the most recent data available to train and retrain
    your model. In many forecasting applications, machine learning models are retrained
    every time a new forecast must be predicted.

    If your model does not integrate each new data point, these data points cannot
    be used as reference cases against new values. This can be solved through offline
    learning as well, but online learning may be the more appropriate solution to
    tackle this use case.

    They can, therefore, learn in multiple passes. This way, a big dataset does not
    have to pass at once in a model but can be passed in multiple steps. This is a
    big advantage when the datasets are large, or when the computing resources are
    limited.

    newer processes when updating: it is less fixed. Therefore, where an offline model
    can become obsolete when data trends change slightly over time, an online model
    can adapt to these changes and remain performant.'

  id: totrans-41

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, and more important, online learning has a risk of models learning things
    that you don't want them to learn or things that are wrong. With offline learning,
    you have much more control to validate what a model learns before pushing it to
    a production environment, whereas when pushing online learning to production environments,
    it may well continue to learn and decrease in performance due to the updates that
    it has learned.

    added value of online learning that was cited before. If you want a model to adapt
    well to more recent data, you will have to choose an **adaptive** online learning
    method. These methods deal well with any situation that would need a model to
    adapt, for example, new trends that appear in the underlying data before people
    even become aware of them.

    theory and practice. You have seen different types of online machine learning,
    including incremental, adaptive, and reinforcement learning.

- en: You have seen a number of advantages and disadvantages of online machine learning.
    Among other reasons, you may be almost obliged to refer to online methods if quick
    relearning is required. A disadvantage is that fewer methods are commonly available,
    as batch learning remains the industry standard for now.

    on anomaly detection. You'll see how machine learning can be used to replace the
    fixed rule alerting system that was built in previous chapters. In the chapters
    after that, you'll learn more about online classification and regression using
    River with examples that continue the learnings from the iris classification model
    from the current chapter.
