- en: Before you do any analysis and find results from your dataset, you need to understand
    the data. You can do so by data exploration and visualization. ML Studio provides
    a very basic option to do so, but with the most essential information. To use
    the tool and understand the data, you need to be familiar with some of the basic
    concepts such as **mean**, **standard deviation**, **variables**, or **features**
    in a dataset, and basic plotting techniques, such as **histogram**, **box plot**,
    **scatter plot**, and so on. The first part of this chapter will familiarize you
    with these concepts and then you will find the use of these inside ML Studio to
    apply them to a sample dataset. If you are a practitioner or are familiar with
    statistics, feel free to skip the basic concepts section and move on to the next.

    values, such as **Age** and **Monthly** **Income($)** in this case. You can apply
    mathematical operations to a numeric feature. A categorical feature usually contains
    string values for a set of categories. For example, **Gender** can be of two categories,
    as in this dataset—**Male** or **Female**. In some cases, a categorical feature
    can also assume values that are numeric, for example, you may like to represent
    **Male** with the number **0** and **Female** with **1**. So, the feature **Gender**
    will have values 0 and 1, but it will still be a categorical feature or variable.
