    accurate machine learning models in record time. It allows anyone to easily harness
    the power of artificial intelligence and increase the productivity and profitability
    of their business. With a series of clicks on a **graphical user interface** (**GUI**),
    novices and seasoned data scientists alike can easily train and deploy machine
    learning solutions to production.'

- en: This book will teach you how to use Azure AutoML with both the GUI and the Azure
    Machine Learning Python SDK in a careful, step-by-step fashion. First, you'll
    learn how to prepare data, train models, and register them to your Azure Machine
    Learning workspace. Then, you'll learn how to take those models and use them to
    create both automated batch solutions using machine learning pipelines and real-time
    scoring solutions using **Azure Kubernetes Service** (**AKS**).

- en: By the time you finish *Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure*, you
    will be able to use AutoML on your own data to not only train regression, classification,
    and forecasting models but also use them to solve a wide variety of business problems.
    You'll be able to show your business partners exactly how your machine learning
    models make predictions through automatically generated charts and graphs, earning
    their trust and respect.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16595_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Introducing AutoML,*
    begins by explaining the current state of data science and artificial intelligence
    in industry and why so many companies are having such a hard time extracting value
    from data. It explains how data scientists work, why their processes are inherently
    slow, and why they need to be made quicker. Finally, it introduces AutoML as the
    solution to achieve the return on investment required by industry.'

    Azure Machine Learning Service,* goes into depth in explaining the different artifacts
    of Azure Machine Learning and how they integrate to form end-to-end machine learning
    solutions. You''ll learn about datastores, datasets, compute instances, compute
    clusters, environments, and experiments, and how you use them to create machine
    learning solutions on Azure.'

    AutoML Model,* will have you create your first AutoML model using publicly available
    Titanic data. You will use the Azure Machine Learning Studio GUI to upload your
    data into your workspace, create a dataset, and run an AutoML classification job
    to predict Titanic survivors. Lastly, you''ll use AutoML''s explainability features
    to see which factors were most vital to predicting survival.'

    Solution,* will help you train an AutoML regression model using the Azure Machine
    Learning SDK in Python. You''ll learn how to access Jupyter notebooks within Azure
    Machine Learning, use compute clusters for remote training on the cloud, and create
    an AutoML model that predicts a number. By the end of this chapter, you will be
    able to replicate this work for any regression problem you have in the future.'

    Solution*, will help you train an AutoML classification model using the Azure
    Machine Learning SDK in Python in two ways. First, you''ll train a binary classification
    model to predict one of two categories. Then, you will train a multiclass classification
    model to predict one of three categories. By the end of this chapter, you''ll
    be an expert in training all types of classification models with AutoML.'

    and one of the hardest to master. In this chapter, you''ll learn how to code a
    forecasting solution with AutoML, making use of advanced forecasting-specific
    algorithms and features. You''ll learn the ins and outs of forecasting and be
    able to avoid many of the common mistakes people make while forecasting.'

    (**MMSA**) is a cutting-edge Azure technology that lets companies train hundreds
    of thousands of models quickly and easily. Here, you will learn how to access
    the MMSA and adapt it to your own problems. This is a powerful code-only solution
    aimed at seasoned data scientists, but even novices will be able to use it by
