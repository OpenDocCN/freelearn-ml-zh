  zh: 第一章 机器学习概述
- en: Recent years have seen the revival of **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) and
    machine learning in particular, both in academic circles and the industry. In
    the last decade, AI has seen dramatic successes that eluded practitioners in the
    intervening years since the original promise of the field gave way to relative
    decline until its re-emergence in the last few years.

  zh: 近年来，人工智能（AI）和机器学习在学术界和工业界都得到了复兴，尤其是机器学习。在过去十年中，人工智能取得了显著的成就，这些成就超越了该领域最初承诺以来在中间几年中从业者所取得的成就。
- en: What made these successes possible, in large part, was the impetus provided
    by the need to process the prodigious amounts of ever-growing data, key algorithmic
    advances by dogged researchers in deep learning, and the inexorable increase in
    raw computational power driven by Moore's Law. Among the areas of AI leading the
    resurgence, machine learning has seen spectacular developments, and continues
    to find the widest applicability in an array of domains. The use of machine learning
    to help in complex decision making at the highest levels of business and, at the
    same time, its enormous success in improving the accuracy of what are now everyday
    applications, such as searches, speech recognition, and personal assistants on
    mobile phones, have made its effects commonplace in the family room and the board
    room alike. Articles breathlessly extolling the power of deep learning can be
    found today not only in the popular science and technology press but also in mainstream
    outlets such as *The New York Times* and *The Huffington Post*. Machine learning
    has indeed become ubiquitous in a relatively short time.

  zh: 这些成功在很大程度上得益于处理日益增长的大量数据的迫切需求、深度学习领域研究人员不懈努力的关键算法进步，以及摩尔定律推动的原始计算能力的不断增长。在人工智能领域引领复苏的各个领域中，机器学习取得了显著的发展，并在众多领域找到了最广泛的应用。机器学习在帮助最高层级的商业复杂决策中的应用，以及它在提高如今已成为日常应用的准确性（如搜索、语音识别和手机上的个人助理）方面的巨大成功，使得其影响在家庭客厅和会议室中变得司空见惯。如今，不仅可以在科普科技媒体中找到对深度学习力量的狂热赞扬文章，还可以在主流媒体如《纽约时报》和《赫芬顿邮报》等地方找到。机器学习确实在相对较短的时间内变得无处不在。

    activities. Most e-mail providers, including Yahoo and Gmail, give the user automated
    sorting and categorization of e-mails into headings such as Spam, Junk, Promotions,
    and so on, which is made possible using text mining, a branch of machine learning.
    When shopping online for products on e-commerce websites, such as [https://www.amazon.com/](https://www.amazon.com/),
    or watching movies from content providers, such as Netflix, one is offered recommendations
    for other products and content by so-called recommender systems, another branch

    of machine learning techniques in the more popular languages, such as Java, Python,
    R, and increasingly, Scala. Fortunately, thanks to the thousands of contributors
    in the open source community, each of these languages has a rich and rapidly growing
    set of libraries, frameworks, and tutorials that make state-of-the-art techniques
    accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a computer, for the most
    part. Java is an important vehicle for this spread of tools and technology, especially
    in large-scale machine learning projects, owing to its maturity and stability
    in enterprise-level deployments and the portable JVM platform, not to mention
    the legions of professional programmers who have adopted it over the years. Consequently,
    mastery of the skills so lacking in the workforce today will put any aspiring
    professional with a desire to enter the field at a distinct advantage in the marketplace.

    automobile owners in the next four years. Since it is usually prohibitive (or

    subset is selected for the purpose of analysis. A crucial consideration in the

    ensure all categories are represented in the sample, the population is divided
    into distinct strata based on these classifications, and each stratum is sampled
    in proportion to the fraction of its class in the overall population. Stratified
    sampling is common when the population density varies across categories, and it
    is important to compare these categories with the same statistical power. Political
    polling often involves stratified sampling when it is known that different demographic
    groups vote in significantly different ways. Disproportional representation of

    which is about learning from labeled data. If the data type of the label is categorical,
    it becomes a classification problem, and if numeric, it is known as a regression
    problem. For example, if the goal of using of the dataset is the detection of
    fraud, which has categorical values of either true or false, we are dealing with
    a classification problem. If, on the other hand, the target is to predict the
    best price to list the sale of a home, which is a numeric dollar value, the problem
    is one of regression. The following figure illustrates labeled data that warrants
    the use of classification techniques, such as logistic regression that is suitable
    for linearly separable data, that is, when there exists a line that can cleanly
    separate the two classes. For higher dimensional data that may be linearly separable,
    one speaks of a separating hyperplane:![Machine learning – types and subtypes](img/B05137_01_01.jpg)'

    is, datasets with a large number of features, scalability of machine learning
    algorithms becomes a serious concern. One of the issues with adding more features
    to the data is that it introduces sparsity, that is, there are now fewer data
    points on average per unit volume of feature space unless an increase in the number
    of features is accompanied by an exponential increase in the number of training
    examples. This can hamper performance in many methods, such as distance-based
    algorithms. Adding more features can also deteriorate the predictive power of
    learners, as illustrated in the following figure. In such cases, a more suitable
    algorithm is needed, or the dimensionality of the data must be reduced.![Practical
