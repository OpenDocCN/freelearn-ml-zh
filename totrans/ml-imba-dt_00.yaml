    from data using algorithms to make informed decisions, automate tasks, and extract
    valuable insights. One particular aspect that often garners attention is imbalanced
    data, where certain classes may have considerably fewer samples than others.

    of skewed data. You will gain insights into best practices for managing imbalanced
    datasets in ML contexts.

    that the techniques to address this imbalance are not universally applicable.
    Their relevance and necessity depend on various factors such as the domain, the
    data distribution, the performance metrics you’re optimizing, and the business
    objectives. Before adopting any techniques, it’s essential to establish a baseline.
    Even if you don’t currently face issues with imbalanced data, it can be beneficial
    to be aware of the challenges and solutions discussed in this book. Familiarizing
    yourself with these techniques will provide you with a comprehensive toolkit,
    preparing you for scenarios that you may not yet know you’ll encounter. If you
    do find that model performance is lacking, especially for underrepresented (minority)
    classes, the insights and strategies covered in the book can be instrumental in
    guiding** **effective improvements.**'

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17259_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introduction to Data Imbalance
    in Machine Learning*, serves as an exploration of data imbalance within the context
    of ML. This chapter elucidates the nature of imbalanced data, distinguishing it
    from other dataset types. It also provides a comprehensive introduction to the
    essential components of ML and model performance metrics most relevant for cases
    when there is a data imbalance. The chapter looks into the issues and concerns
    involved in dealing with imbalanced data, explaining when it can occur and why
    it can sometimes be a challenge. More importantly, we will go over when not to
    worry about data imbalance at all or when it may not be worth worrying about.
    Furthermore, it introduces the `imbalanced-learn` library, offering invaluable
    insights and general guidelines to navigate the intricacies of dealing with imbalanced
    datasets effectively.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17259_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042), *Oversampling Methods*, introduces
    the concept of oversampling, outlining when to employ it and when not to, and
    various techniques to augment imbalanced datasets. It guides you through the practical
    application of these techniques using the `imbalanced-learn` library and compares
    their performance across classical ML models. Practical advice on the effectiveness
    of these techniques in real-world scenarios concludes the chapter.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17259_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079), *Undersampling Methods*, presents
    the concept of undersampling as an effective approach for data balancing when
    standard oversampling isn’t an option. This chapter covers strategies to effectively
    remove examples from imbalanced data, different ways of addressing noisy observations,
    and procedures for handling easily categorized instances. We will also discuss
    when to avoid undersampling of the majority class.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17259_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120), *Ensemble Methods*, explores
    the application of ensemble techniques, including bagging and boosting, to enhance
    the performance of ML models. Moreover, it tackles the challenge of imbalanced
    datasets, where traditional ensemble methods may be ineffective, by combining
    the ensemble methods with the techniques introduced in previous chapters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17259_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor151), *Cost-Sensitive Learning*,
    explores some alternatives to sampling techniques, including oversampling and
    undersampling. This chapter highlights the significance of cost-sensitive learning
    as an effective strategy to overcome the problem of imbalanced datasets. We also
    discuss **threshold-tuning techniques**, which can be very relevant in the context
    of data imbalance.'

    by imbalanced datasets. You will investigate typical types of imbalanced data
    challenges in various deep learning applications and develop an understanding
    of their impact.'

    Methods*, marks a transition from classical ML to deep learning, exploring the
    adaptation of familiar data-level sampling techniques and unveiling opportunities
    for enhancing these methods in the context of deep learning models. It dives into
    combining deep learning with oversampling and undersampling techniques, covering
    dynamic sampling and data augmentation for images and text. It emphasizes the
    fundamental differences between deep learning and classical ML, particularly the
    nature of the data they handle, whereas deep learning deals with unstructured
    data such as images, text, audio, and video. The chapter also explores techniques
    to address class imbalance in computer vision and their applicability to **Natural
    Language Processing** (**NLP**) problems.'

    *Cost-Sensitive Learning*, and applies them to deep learning models. We adapt
    deep learning models through loss function modifications using the PyTorch deep
    learning framework, ultimately enhancing model performance and enabling more effective
    predictions.'

    methods from the previous two chapters. This chapter introduces the concept of
    graph ML and employs a real-world Facebook social network dataset to provide valuable
    insights and practical applications for addressing data imbalance in deep learning.
    We will also introduce the concept of hard mining loss and build upon it to explore
    a specialized technique called **minority class incremental rectification**, which
    combines hard mining with cross-entropy loss.'

- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B17259_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor279), *Model Calibration*, takes
    a different angle of addressing data imbalance. Rather than focusing on data preprocessing
    or model building, this chapter highlights the post-processing of prediction scores
    obtained from trained models. Such post-processing can be valuable for both real-time
    predictions and offline model evaluation. The chapter offers insights into measuring
    the calibration of a model and explains why this aspect can be indispensable when
    dealing with imbalanced data. This is particularly important since data balancing
    techniques can often lead to model miscalibration.'

- en: OpenAI was trying to solve the problem of bias in training data of the image
    generation model DALL-E 2 [1]. DALL-E 2 is trained on a massive dataset of images
    from the internet, which can contain biases. For example, the dataset may contain
    more images of men than women or more images of people from certain racial or
    ethnic groups than others.

    imbalance and what strategies they adopted to effectively navigate these challenges.
    For instance, the tip on OpenAI’s approach with DALL-E 2 sheds light on the intricate
    balance between filtering training data and inadvertently amplifying biases. Such
    examples underscore the importance of being both strategic and cautious when dealing
    with imbalanced data. To delve deeper into the specifics and understand the nitty-gritty
    of these implementations, you are encouraged to follow the company blog or paper
