- en: You are reading this probably because you are aware of the importance of machine
    learning and advanced analytics, such as predictive analytics. While there is
    an increasing demand for people all over the world who possess these skill sets,
    there is a real scarcity of data scientists who are skilled enough to deliver
    applications that involve machine learning and advanced analytics and can create
    real value from the available data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this scarcity is because the field of machine learning and data
    mining used to be the realm of PhDs and experts in subjects such as math, statistics,
    and programming combined. It's really difficult to find such unicorns. Again,
    tasks such as predictive analytics have historically been so difficult that even
    experts, even if they don't exactly struggle, don't find it easy either. This
    means that years of experience are needed for newcomers to to get on with it.

- en: In this modern age, predictive analytics is on the verge of being industrialized
    as it is the key to sustaining and promoting the growth of a business. While the
    scarcity of "unicorn" data scientists doesn't seem to be ending, organizations
    are now finding solutions to get over this problem. A leading IT research firm,
    Gartner, suggests that, in the coming days, a new breed of professionals will
    emerge, referred to as citizen data scientists. Their emergence may bring about
    such a change that they may soon outnumber unicorn data scientists by a ratio
    of 5:1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be wondering now, who are these citizen data scientists and where
    have they come from? They are existing developers, people from the business analyst
    community, and, possibly, new graduates as well, who are data-savvy, passionate
    about advanced analytics, and determined to stretch themselves and go in-depth
    into data science concepts. They will democratize data science and enable the
    industrialization of advanced analytics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'All this is happening and will continue to happen because of one reason: the
    arrival of new tools and platforms that make advanced analytics so easy and present
    data science as a commodity. While this brings huge opportunities for such vendors,
    it also bring good news for organizations and professionals who are picking it
    up. There is no doubt that Azure Machine Learning is a leader in this field and
    Microsoft offers this to organizations, strategically.'

    Machine Learning, describes Azure Machine Learning, as published in CITEworld:
    "This is the fastest way to build predictive models and deploy them. Very few
    tools exist today if you''re going to build solution on the cloud and create applications.
    This way you can build intelligent applications from data, then publish as APIs
    so you can hook them up very easily from any enterprise application—and even from
    mobile. We''re building it simple enough for a high schooler to be able to use
    it."'

    the mission to develop the necessary skills to get started with Microsoft Azure
    Machine Learning as quickly as possible. The book assumes no prerequisites other
