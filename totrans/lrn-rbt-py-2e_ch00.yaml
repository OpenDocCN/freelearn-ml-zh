- en: '*Learning Robotics using Python* contains nine chapters that explain how to
    build an autonomous mobile robot from scratch and program it using Python. The
    robot mentioning in this book is a service robot that can be used to serve food
    in home, hotels, and restaurant. From the beginning to end, the book discusses
    step-by-step procedures of building of this robot. The book starts with the basics
    concepts of robotics and then moves to the 3D modeling and simulation of the robot.
    After successful simulation of the robot, it discusses the hardware components
    required to build the robot prototype.'

- en: The software part of this robot is mainly implemented using Python programming
    language and software frameworks, such as Robot Operating System (ROS) and OpenCV.
    You can see the application of python from the designing of a robot to creating
    robot user interface. The Gazebo simulator is used to simulate the robot and machine
    vision libraries, such as OpenCV, OpenNI, and PCL, is for processing the 2D and
    3D image data. Each chapter is presented with adequate theory for understanding
    the application part. The book is reviewed by the experts in this field and it
    is the result of their handwork and passion in robotics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is all about building a robot; to start with this book, you should
    have some hardware. The robot can be built from scratch or you can buy a differential
    drive configuration robot with encoder feedback. You should buy a controller board
    such as Texas instruments LaunchPad for embedded processing and should have at
    least a laptop/netbook for entire robot processing. In this book, we are using
    Intel NUC for robot processing, it is very compact in size and delivering high
    performance. For 3D vision, you should have a 3D sensor such as laser scanner,
    Kinect, or Orbecc Astra.

- en: In the software section, you should have a good understanding in working with
    GNU/Linux commands and have good knowledge in Python too. You should install Ubuntu
    16.04 LTS to work with the examples. If you have knowledge in ROS, OpenCV, OpenNI,
    and PCL, this will help. You have to install ROS Kinect/Melodic for these examples.
