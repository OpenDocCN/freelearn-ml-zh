			<p>The automation of machine learning tasks allows developers more time to focus on the usability and reactivity of the software powered by machine learning models. TPOT is a Python automated machine learning tool used for optimizing machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. Automating machine learning with TPOT enables individuals and companies to develop production-ready machine learning models more cheaply and quickly than with traditional methods.</p>
			<p>With this practical guide to AutoML, developers working with Python on machine learning tasks will be able to put their knowledge to work and become productive quickly. You'll adopt a hands-on approach to learning the implementation of AutoML and its associated methodologies. Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions, this book will show you how to build automated classification and regression models and compare their performance to custom-built models. As you advance, you'll also develop state-of-the-art models using only a couple of lines of code and see how those models outperform all of your previous models on the same datasets.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll have gained the confidence to implement AutoML techniques in your organization on a production level.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>Data scientists, data analysts, and software developers who are new to machine learning and want to use it in their applications will find this book useful. This book is also for business users looking to automate business tasks with machine learning. Working knowledge of the Python programming language and a beginner-level understanding of machine learning are necessary to get started.</p>

You'll learn how to use Flask and Flask-RESTful to build a REST API that is then deployed both locally and to AWS.</p>
			<p><a href="B16954_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using the Deployed TPOT Model in Production,</em> covers the usage of the deployed model in a notebook environment and in a simple web application.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will need Python 3.6 or newer installed on your computer. The code for the book was tested on Python 3.8.x, but any version above 3.6 should work fine. The book isn't OS-specific, as all of the code will work independently of the OS. Still, keep in mind that most of the code was initially run on macOS.  </p>
