- en: This book will teach you how advanced machine learning can be performed in the
    cloud in a very cheap way. You will learn more about Azure Machine Learning processes
    as an enterprise-ready methodology. This book lets you explore prebuilt templates
    with Azure Machine Learning Studio and build a model using canned algorithms that
    can be deployed as web services. It will help you to discover the different benefits
    of leveraging the cloud for machine learning and AI, deploy virtual machines in
    AI development scenarios, and how to apply R, Python, SQL Server, and Spark in
    Azure.
