</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>What is data literacy?</h1>
<p>As stated previously, data literacy<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> refers to the ability to read, analyze, and understand data. It encompasses a range of skills, including the ability to read and interpret data visualizations, understand statistical concepts, and apply critical thinking to data analysis. Data literacy is becoming increasingly important in today’s data-driven world, as individuals and organizations are faced with ever-growing amounts of data that need to be analyzed and interpreted in order to make <span class="No-Break">informed decisions.</span></p>
<p>In many fields, such as business, healthcare, and government, data literacy has become a crucial skill, and it’s also vital in the field of machine learning, where models are only as good as the data they are <span class="No-Break">trained on.</span></p>
<p>Data literacy is not just about technical<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> skills, but also includes the ability to critically evaluate data and identify potential biases or limitations. It involves a mindset of curiosity, skepticism, and a willingness to ask questions and seek answers. Ultimately, data literacy enables individuals and organizations to make more informed decisions and drive <span class="No-Break">meaningful change.</span></p>
<p>Some of the key skills<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> included in data literacy are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Data collection:</strong> The ability to identify and gather data from various sources, including databases, APIs, surveys, and <span class="No-Break">other sources</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data cleaning:</strong> The ability to clean and preprocess data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and in a usable format <span class="No-Break">for analysis</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data analysis:</strong> The ability to analyze and interpret data using statistical methods, data visualization techniques, machine learning, and <span class="No-Break">other tools</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data visualization:</strong> The ability to create visual representations of data to facilitate understanding <span class="No-Break">and communication</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Effective communication:</strong> The ability to communicate insights and findings from data analysis to others in a clear and <span class="No-Break">concise manner</span></li>

<li><strong class="bold">Technical skills:</strong> Proficiency with tools and technologies used for data analysis, such as programming languages (e.g., Python, R), statistical software (e.g., SAS, SPSS), and data visualization tools (<span class="No-Break">e.g., Qlik)</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Critical thinking:</strong> The ability to evaluate data critically and identify potential biases, limitations, <span class="No-Break">and errors</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Domain knowledge:</strong> Knowledge of the field or industry in which the data is being used, to understand the context of the data and its <span class="No-Break">potential uses</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, data literacy skills<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> can be divided into technical and non-technical skills. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most essential skills next. We will start with non-technical <span class="No-Break">skills first.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Critical thinking</h2>
<p>Critical thinking<a id="_idIndexMarker211"/> is one of the most<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> important skills when working with data. In data literacy, critical thinking refers to the ability to evaluate data in a systematic and objective manner, considering potential biases, limitations, and errors. It involves questioning assumptions, analyzing evidence, and making informed judgments about the quality and reliability of the data. It also involves assessing the limitations of the analysis and recognizing the potential for false conclusions or overgeneralizations based on incomplete or <span class="No-Break">insufficient data.</span></p>
<p>One aspect of critical thinking is considering the broader context in which the data is being used. This includes understanding the goals of the analysis, the intended audience, and the potential implications of the findings. Skills developed in this area will help you to think analytically and draw conclusions that can lead to insights and actions. In a machine-learning context, this skill will help you to understand how to ask proper questions and how to create a suitable model for <span class="No-Break">your analysis.</span></p>
<p>In general, there are some habits that can be used to develop critical-thinking skills. First, you should question all assumptions and not take anything for granted. This way, you can start to develop a habit that can give you new ideas and perspective. You should also seek out diversity. This means simply ensuring that you discuss with other people and hear their views. This habit will make you better at recognizing biases that might represent your own point <span class="No-Break">of view.</span></p>
<p>Lastly, you should use pure logic when making decisions. It is a good idea to reason through each step to make sure that you understand the logic behind everything you do. For example, when planning a machine-learning deployment, it is always a good idea to go through each step of your plan and share the process and results with <span class="No-Break">other people.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Research and domain knowledge</h2>
<p>Most of the time, you might have a comprehensive domain knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> from the field<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/> you are working in, but sometimes being data literate in a certain topic will require research and studying. This could be, for example, cross-checking the results you get from your machine-learning model or simply finding good <span class="No-Break">source data.</span></p>
<p>Another aspect of research<a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> is that it helps you to stay up to date with the latest<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> developments and best practices in the field. With the rapid growth of data and the increasing importance of data-driven decision-making, there is always something to learn, and it is important to keep pace with new technologies, tools, <span class="No-Break">and methods.</span></p>
<p>There is also an ethical aspect involved. Research skills are essential for addressing ethical considerations related to working with data, such as privacy concerns, biases, and the responsible use of data. By conducting research on these topics, you can ensure that you are using data in an ethical and responsible manner and contribute to the development of ethical guidelines and <span class="No-Break">best practices.</span></p>
<p>Research means a lot more than using a search engine. It involves finding good sources and cross-referencing them. It also involves drawing conclusions and evaluating those carefully after the project is done. One method for efficient research is narrowing down. You can start with a broad approach and dig deeper into some of the topics. Never start researching with an outcome already in your mind and keep your mind open. Make sure to verify <span class="No-Break">your sources.</span></p>
<p>Combining research with domain knowledge that you have already acquired from previous experiences is an important skill. This approach will allow you to ask relevant questions, identify key variables, and interpret the data in a meaningful way. Combining research, domain knowledge, effective communication, and technical skills can help you to develop a strong foundation for working with data and machine learning effectively in your field <span class="No-Break">or industry.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Communication</h2>
<p>Individual skills<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> in data literacy<a id="_idIndexMarker218"/> are important but it’s equally important to be able to communicate the data and findings to other people. Effective communication allows you to communicate insights and findings from data analysis in a clear, concise, and meaningful way. It involves not only presenting the data in a clear and understandable manner but also providing context and interpretation that can help the audience to understand the implications and potential uses of <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
<p>Communication is also important for building trust and credibility with the audience. By presenting data in a clear and transparent manner, you can build trust and increase the likelihood that the audience will use the data to inform their decisions. Different audiences may have different levels of technical knowledge and they may be interested in different aspects of the data. By understanding the audience and tailoring the message to their needs, you can increase the effectiveness of your communication and ensure that the audience is able to understand and make use of the data and findings. In a machine learning context, it is crucial to create trust and provide clear communication about the possibilities and limitations of <span class="No-Break">each solution.</span></p>
<p>It is important to make sure that your audience and colleagues are on the same page as you, especially if they are involved in creating the machine-learning models or analyzing the results. Misunderstandings may lead to critical problems and <span class="No-Break">business implications.</span></p>
<p>To improve communication skills, there are several strategies that can be applied specifically to communicating about data. First and foremost, practice is key. The more you practice communicating about data, the more comfortable and confident you will become. It’s also important to know the audience and understand their level of knowledge, goals, and interests. Using plain language, providing context, and using visuals such as graphs and charts can make complex data easier to understand and <span class="No-Break">more engaging.</span></p>
<p>Telling a story can help make the data more compelling and memorable. It’s also important to practice active listening<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> and respond to feedback from the audience <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>in a thoughtful and respectful manner. Seeking feedback from trusted colleagues, mentors, or advisors can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your communication skills <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Technical skills</h2>
<p>Technical skills <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>are a fundamental aspect<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/> of data literacy, as they enable individuals to effectively work with data using various technical tools and platforms. Technical skills encompass a broad range of competencies, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, programming, database management, data modeling, machine learning, and data security <span class="No-Break">and privacy.</span></p>
<p>Data collection involves the ability to gather data from various sources, including databases, websites, APIs, and other data repositories. Data cleaning and preparation are crucial for eliminating errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in raw data and making it ready for analysis. Data analysis includes utilizing statistical methods, machine-learning algorithms, and other analytical techniques to recognize patterns, trends, and insights within data. Data visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data using graphs, charts, and other visualizations to make data more understandable <span class="No-Break">and actionable.</span></p>
<p>Other technical skills<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> can include, for example, programming, database management<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> and data modeling. Technical skills enable individuals to work with data more effectively, develop accurate predictions and insights, and communicate their findings in a way that is easily understood by their audience. Since most of the content of this book is related to technical skills, we are not going deeper into individual skills in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
<p>The following figure summarizes the key skills of being <span class="No-Break">data literate:</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1: Three areas of being data literate</p>
<p>In this section, we familiarized<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> ourselves with the concept<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> of data literacy. Next, we will take a closer look at informed decision-making and how to use data literacy skills to <span class="No-Break">support decision-making.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Informed decision-making</h1>
<p>Informed decision-making<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> refers to the process of using data to make decisions that are supported by evidence and grounded in a thorough understanding of the data. It involves the ability to identify relevant data, analyze it using appropriate tools and techniques, and draw conclusions that are based on evidence rather than assumptions or intuition. Informed decision-making is a critical skill for individuals who work with data, as it allows them to leverage data to drive better outcomes and make decisions that are backed <span class="No-Break">by evidence.</span></p>
<p>To make informed decisions, you must have a clear understanding of the problem or question at hand, as well as the data that is relevant to it. You must be able to identify appropriate data sources, assess the quality of the data, and choose appropriate analytical techniques to analyze it. Informed decision-making also requires you to be able to interpret the results of your analysis and communicate findings effectively <span class="No-Break">to others.</span></p>
<p>Informed decision-making is particularly important in industries where decisions can have significant consequences, such as healthcare, finance, and government. For example, healthcare professionals may use data to make informed decisions about patient care and treatment, while financial analysts may use data to make <span class="No-Break">investment decisions.</span></p>
<p>Informed decision-making is not just about using data to make decisions, but also about using data to evaluate the effectiveness of those decisions. This requires organizations to be able to monitor and measure the outcomes of decisions and use this feedback to refine the decision-making process <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
<p>Ultimately, informed decision-making is the ability to transform information into actions and base all decisions <span class="No-Break">on knowledge.</span></p>
<p>There are many models for informed decision-making in organizations. The one we are going to see here combines the need to ask the right questions, source the correct data in the right format, critically analyze and evaluate the data, apply the domain knowledge of yourself and others (being conscious about potential biases), and communicate the decision to all relevant stakeholders. There is also a mechanism<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> to monitor and iterate the process to make it better <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> at the process. We can divide it into 12 <span class="No-Break">different steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Ask:</strong> Turn your business questions into analytical questions. Draft your questions for machine learning. What is the target outcome you are <span class="No-Break">aiming for?</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Acquire:</strong> Find all relevant data. Remember to utilize both the internal and public data available and relevant to <span class="No-Break">your problem.</span></li>
<li>Ensure that you have all the needed data available and cross check that it can be trusted. Make sure that it’s in right format. Utilize profiling, scaling, tagging, standardization, and catalog features. Make sure you have handled sensitive <span class="No-Break">data correctly.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Analyze:</strong> Create a proper analysis and visualizations to describe your data, <span class="No-Break">with KPIs.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Find patterns and trends:</strong> Try to plot relationships and drill deeper into data. Start thinking about your original question. Can it be solved and is it <span class="No-Break">still relevant?</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Apply:</strong> Review what you have achieved so far and start applying your domain knowledge to <span class="No-Break">the results.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Challenge your findings and data:</strong> Look for any evidence that gives you a reason to disprove your <span class="No-Break">earlier findings.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Review the results with your team and colleagues:</strong> If you are working alone, try to take another look and find <span class="No-Break">possible bias.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Start leveraging machine learning:</strong> Run multiple simulations and build multiple models. Test all solutions carefully and review the results. Augment your earlier analysis with <span class="No-Break">the results.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Announce:</strong> Communicate your findings and results to your organization. Make sure to present them to the right audience. Use different levels of detail for <span class="No-Break">different stakeholders.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Access:</strong> Set up a mechanism to review your work. Monitor the effects of the <span class="No-Break">decisions made.</span></li>
<li>Leverage all feedback collected<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> and iterate your process. Try to fail fast and fix the issues instantly. Document your findings and how these have altered the <span class="No-Break">original process.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Developing a good process for you and your organization can take time and multiple iterations but it will greatly benefit both individuals and the organization over time. When decisions are based on facts and data, they are easier to justify and will guide you to the correct path more often than decisions based on only partial information or <span class="No-Break">a feeling.</span></p>
<p>Over a longer period, having a refined decision-making process will lead to reduced risk, increased efficiency, better resource allocation, improved communication, and <span class="No-Break">competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p>In this section, we investigated<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> the methods of informed decision-making and how to make informed decisions at an organizational level. In the next section, we will move towards the larger picture and focus on <span class="No-Break">data strategy.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Data strategy</h1>
<p>Data strategy<a id="_idIndexMarker232"/> is a crucial element of any organization’s overall strategy, as it enables organizations to leverage data to achieve their objectives. A well-designed data strategy considers the organization’s goals, challenges, and available resources and outlines the steps needed to collect, manage, analyze, and use <span class="No-Break">data effectively.</span></p>
<p>One of the key components of a data strategy is data governance, which establishes policies and procedures for data management and usage across the organization. Data governance includes defining data ownership, establishing data standards, and ensuring compliance with data regulations. By having a clear understanding of data governance, organizations can ensure that data is being used ethically and securely, which builds trust <span class="No-Break">with stakeholders.</span></p>
<p>Well-defined data architecture is another cornerstone of a working data strategy. Data architecture involves designing the structure and systems for managing and storing data. This includes defining data models, selecting appropriate database technologies, and ensuring data integration across systems. By having a robust data architecture in place, organizations can ensure that data is accessible, accurate, and consistent, which improves decision-making and <span class="No-Break">operational efficiency.</span></p>
<p>Data analytics and machine learning can be seen as core technologies to leverage data strategy. This involves using various techniques to extract insights from data using predictive modeling, machine learning, and data visualization platforms. By using data analytics to gain insights, organizations can make more informed decisions, identify new opportunities, and improve <span class="No-Break">business processes.</span></p>
<p>Data quality is essential<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> in a data strategy, as it ensures that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. This includes establishing data quality standards, performing data validation, and cleansing data as needed. By ensuring data quality, organizations can trust the data they are using for decision-making, which reduces the risk of making errors and improves <span class="No-Break">operational efficiency.</span></p>
<p>Security and data ownership are key components of every working data strategy. Data security ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and cyber threats. This includes implementing data security policies, using encryption technologies, and establishing access controls. By securing data, organizations can prevent data breaches, which protects their reputation and reduces the risk of financial and <span class="No-Break">legal penalties.</span></p>
<p>Having clear ownership for all the data assets will make it transparent who has the right to approve the usage of data and make updates or modifications to datasets. The data steward or owner also works as a domain expert of the data assets and can be a point of contact for data-related questions inside <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
<p>When creating a data strategy for an organization, there are some key principles to follow. The basics of a working data strategy involve understanding the key components and designing a plan that aligns with the organization’s goals, challenges, and <span class="No-Break">available resources.</span></p>
<p>Some of the basics of a working<a id="_idIndexMarker234"/> data strategy include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the organization’s goals: A data strategy should align with the organization’s overall goals and objectives. This involves understanding what the organization wants to achieve and how data can support <span class="No-Break">those goals.</span></li>
<li>Defining data governance: Data governance is critical to ensuring that data is managed and used ethically and securely. This involves defining data ownership, establishing data standards, and ensuring compliance with <span class="No-Break">data regulations.</span></li>
<li>Establishing data architecture: A well-designed data architecture is essential to managing and storing data effectively. This involves defining data models, selecting appropriate database technologies, and ensuring data integration <span class="No-Break">across systems.</span></li>
<li>Using data analytics: Data analytics is critical to extracting insights from data and making informed decisions. This involves using various techniques such as predictive modeling, machine learning, and <span class="No-Break">data visualization.</span></li>
<li>Ensuring data quality: Data quality is critical to ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. This involves establishing data quality standards, performing data validation, and cleansing data <span class="No-Break">as needed.</span></li>
<li>Securing data: Data security<a id="_idIndexMarker235"/> is critical to protecting data from unauthorized access and cyber threats. This involves implementing data security policies, using encryption technologies, and establishing <span class="No-Break">access controls.</span></li>
<li>Monitoring and adapting: A data strategy should be monitored regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with the organization’s goals and is delivering the expected benefits. It may need to be adapted as the organization’s goals, challenges, or available<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> <span class="No-Break">resources change.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure summarizes the key pillars<a id="_idIndexMarker237"/> of a <span class="No-Break">data strategy:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer019">

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2: Pillars of a data strategy</p>
<p>Evaluating the maturity of the current data strategy is a good starting point for improvements. The existing data strategy should be constantly evaluated. To evaluate the maturity of an organization’s data strategy, it is necessary to assess the extent to which it aligns with its goals and objectives, and its ability to execute the strategy effectively. This involves defining the key criteria that are relevant to evaluating the maturity, such as data governance policies, data architecture, data analytics capabilities, data quality metrics, and data <span class="No-Break">security guidance.</span></p>
<p>The next step is to assess the organization’s current data strategy against the identified criteria. This may involve reviewing existing documentation, interviewing stakeholders, and performing data analysis. Based on this assessment, any gaps or areas of improvement that need to be addressed to improve the maturity of the data strategy should <span class="No-Break">be identified.</span></p>
<p>A roadmap for improving the maturity<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> of the data strategy can then be developed based on the assessment and gap analysis. This roadmap should include specific action items, timelines, and resources required to implement the roadmap. Regular monitoring of the progress of the data strategy implementation is necessary, and adjustments to the roadmap may be needed as the organization’s goals or data-related <span class="No-Break">challenges change.</span></p>
<p>By regularly evaluating the maturity of a data strategy, it is possible to identify areas of improvement and develop a roadmap for improving the <span class="No-Break">organization’s capabilities.</span></p>
<p>There are many maturity models for organizations. Next, we are going to take a brief look at one model that combines multiple common approaches <span class="No-Break">into one.</span></p>
<p>This model describes the organization’s<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> maturity using <span class="No-Break">four steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>The organization is just getting started with a data strategy. They use mainly internal data and ad hoc analysis. There are no analytics in place or only simple descriptive analytics are used. Static reports and spreadsheets are <span class="No-Break">common tools.</span></li>
<li>The organization recognizes the importance of a data strategy. They are making insightful business decisions and care about the quality of data. Analysis can include diagnostic use cases and there is typically a <span class="No-Break">BI platform.</span></li>
<li>The organization uses data as described in the previous step, but they are augmenting the use cases and using external data to complement the internal data. Use cases can include predictive analysis and machine learning. There is a data strategy in action and decisions are mainly based on an informed <span class="No-Break">decision-making model.</span></li>
<li>At the highest level of the organization are the leaders and innovators when it comes to using data. They are staying on top of the latest trends and use data in innovative ways. They are developing machine-learning models and utilizing prescriptive analytics to automatically prescribe the best course of action. They are constantly iterating the current data strategy and adapting new ways of working. Roles<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> and the organizational structure support the comprehensive usage <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Creating a data strategy and transforming the organization from the first level of maturity to a data innovator is a long-term project and is not further discussed in this book. There is a lot of material written about data strategy and it is highly recommended to also consider the bigger picture when working with data and utilizing machine learning in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we first learned what data literacy means as a concept. We investigated the methods of being data literate and discussed how to apply these methods to our work. Being able to read and utilize data is an important skill in the modern world, since there is an increasing amount of data around us all <span class="No-Break">the time.</span></p>
<p>We discovered what informed decision-making is and went through the process of making informed decisions with data, analytics, and machine learning. This process will be our guiding light in the next chapter when we are starting to lean towards the practice. It will give us guidelines that we will use to form our machine-learning question and when we are defining <span class="No-Break">the solution.</span></p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, we briefly discussed data strategy and maturity. Data strategy is an important aspect of every modern organization but is also a wide topic. We scratched the surface of how to define the maturity of an organization from a data point of view and what are the most important aspects of a <span class="No-Break">data strategy.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will start to focus on a practical approach to solving problems with machine learning. We will go through the steps required to create a good machine learning solution with the Qlik platform. We will cover how to define a problem and select a model, how to prepare the data, and what to consider when visualizing the <span class="No-Break">end results.</span></p>
