- en: This section will give you the necessary conceptual exposure to explainability
    techniques for **machine learning** (**ML**) models with practical examples. You
    will learn about the foundational concepts, different dimensions of explainability,
    various model explainability methods, and even data-centric approaches to explainability.
    Knowledge of the foundational concepts will help you understand the guidelines
    for designing robust explainable ML systems like those covered in this book.
