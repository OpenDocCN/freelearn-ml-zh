This concept relies on the idea that instead of looking at the image as a whole (that is, extracting global features), it could be advantageous to select some special points in the image and perform a local analysis on them (that is, extracting local features). This approach works well as long as a sufficient number of such points are detected in the images of interest, and these points are distinguishing and stable features, that can be accurately localized.</p><p class="calibre8">Because they are used for analyzing image content, feature points should ideally be detected at the same scene or object location, no matter from which viewpoint, scale, or orientation the image was taken. View invariance is a very desirable property in image analysis and has been the object of numerous studies. As we will see, different detectors have different invariance properties. This chapter focuses on the keypoint extraction process itself. The following chapters will then show you how interest points can be put to work in different contexts, such as image matching or image geometry estimation.</p></div></div>

They are indeed local features that can be easily localized in an image, and in addition, they should abound in scenes of man-made objects (where they are produced by walls, doors, windows, tables, and so on). Corners are also interesting because they are two-dimensional features that can be accurately detected (even at sub-pixel accuracy), as they are at the junction of two edges. This is in contrast to points located on a uniform area or on the contour of an object; these ones would be difficult to repeatedly localize precisely on other images of the same object. The Harris feature detector is a classical approach to detecting corners in an image. We will explore this operator in this recipe.</p><div class="calibre1" title="How to do it..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec154" class="calibre6"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">The basic OpenCV function that is used to detect Harris corners is called <code class="literal">cv::cornerHarris</code> and is straightforward to use. You call it on an input image, and the result is an image of floats that gives you the corner strength at each pixel location. A threshold is then applied on this output image in order to obtain a set of detected corners. This is accomplished with the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Detect Harris Corners 
    cv::Mat cornerStrength; 
    cv::cornerHarris(image,          // input image 
                     cornerStrength, // image of cornerness 
                     3,              // neighborhood size 
                     3,              // aperture size 
                     0.01);          // Harris parameter 
 
    // threshold the corner strengths 
    cv::Mat harrisCorners; 
    double threshold= 0.0001; 
    cv::threshold(cornerStrength,harrisCorners, 
                  threshold,255,cv::THRESH_BINARY); 
</pre>Here is the original image:

</p><p class="calibre8">The result is a binary map image, shown in the following screenshot, which is inverted for better viewing (that is, we used <code class="literal">cv::THRESH_BINARY_INV</code> instead of <code class="literal">cv::THRESH_BINARY</code> to get the detected corners in black):</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How to do it..." src="graphics/B05388_08_02.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">From the preceding function call, we observe that this interest point detector requires several parameters (these will be explained in the next section) that might make it difficult to tune. In addition, the corner map that is obtained contains many clusters of corner pixels that contradict the fact that we would like to detect well-localized points. Therefore, we will try to improve the corner detection method by defining our own class to detect Harris corners.</p><p class="calibre8">The class encapsulates the Harris parameters with their default values and corresponding getter and setter methods (which are not shown here):</p><pre class="programlisting">    class HarrisDetector { 
 
      private: 
 
      // 32-bit float image of corner strength 
      cv::Mat cornerStrength; 
      // 32-bit float image of thresholded corners 
      cv::Mat cornerTh; 
      // image of local maxima (internal) 
      cv::Mat localMax; 
      // size of neighborhood for derivatives smoothing 
      int neighborhood; 
      // aperture for gradient computation 
      int aperture; 
      // Harris parameter 
      double k; 
      // maximum strength for threshold computation 
      double maxStrength; 
      // calculated threshold (internal) 
      double threshold; 
      // size of neighborhood for non-max suppression 
      int nonMaxSize; 
      // kernel for non-max suppression 
      cv::Mat kernel; 
 
      public: 
 
      HarrisDetector(): neighborhood(3), aperture(3),  
                        k(0.01), maxStrength(0.0),  
                        threshold(0.01), nonMaxSize(3) { 
 
         // create kernel used in non-maxima suppression 
         setLocalMaxWindowSize(nonMaxSize); 
      } 
</pre><p class="calibre8">To detect the Harris corners on an image, we proceed in two steps. First, the Harris values at each pixel are computed:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Compute Harris corners 
    void detect(const cv::Mat&amp; image) { 
 
      // Harris computation 
      cv::cornerHarris(image,cornerStrength,                   
                       neighbourhood,// neighborhood size 
                       aperture,     // aperture size 
                       k);           // Harris parameter 
  
      // internal threshold computation 
      cv::minMaxLoc(cornerStrength,0,&amp;maxStrength); 
 
      // local maxima detection 
      cv::Mat dilated;  //temporary image 
      cv::dilate(cornerStrength,dilated,cv::Mat()); 
      cv::compare(cornerStrength,dilated, localMax, cv::CMP_EQ); 
    } 
</pre><p class="calibre8">Next, the feature points are obtained, based on a specified threshold value. Since the range of possible values for Harris depends on the particular choices of its parameters, the threshold is specified as a quality level that is defined as a fraction of the maximal Harris value computed in the image:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Get the corner map from the computed Harris values 
    cv::Mat getCornerMap(double qualityLevel) { 
 
      cv::Mat cornerMap; 
 
      // thresholding the corner strength 
      threshold= qualityLevel*maxStrength; 
      cv::threshold(cornerStrength,cornerTh, threshold, 255,
                    cv::THRESH_BINARY); 
 
      // convert to 8-bit image 
      cornerTh.convertTo(cornerMap,CV_8U); 
 
      // non-maxima suppression 
      cv::bitwise_and(cornerMap,localMax,cornerMap); 
 
      return cornerMap; 
    } 
</pre><p class="calibre8">This method returns a binary corner map of the detected features. The fact that the detection of the Harris features has been split into two methods, allows us to test the detection with a different threshold (until an appropriate number of feature points are obtained) without the need to repeat costly computations. It is also possible to obtain the Harris features in the form of a <code class="literal">std::vector</code> of <code class="literal">cv::Point</code> instances:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Get the feature points from the computed Harris values 
    void getCorners(std::vector&lt;cv::Point&gt; &amp;points, double qualityLevel) { 
 
      // Get the corner map 
      cv::Mat cornerMap= getCornerMap(qualityLevel); 
      // Get the corners 
      getCorners(points, cornerMap); 
    } 
 
    // Get the feature points from the computed corner map 
    void getCorners(std::vector&lt;cv::Point&gt; &amp;points,
                    const cv::Mat&amp; cornerMap) { 
 
      // Iterate over the pixels to obtain all features 
      for( int y = 0; y &lt; cornerMap.rows; y++ ) { 
 
        const uchar* rowPtr = cornerMap.ptr&lt;uchar&gt;(y); 
 
        for( int x = 0; x &lt; cornerMap.cols; x++ ) { 
 
          // if it is a feature point 
          if (rowPtr[x]) { 
 
            points.push_back(cv::Point(x,y)); 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    } 
</pre><p class="calibre8">This class also improves the detection of the Harris corners by adding a non-maxima suppression step, which will be explained in the next section. The detected points can now be drawn on an image using the <code class="literal">cv::circle</code> function, as demonstrated by the following method:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Draw circles at feature point locations on an image 
    void drawOnImage(cv::Mat &amp;image,  
                     const std::vector&lt;cv::Point&gt; &amp;points,  
                     cv::Scalar color= cv::Scalar(255,255,255),  
                     int radius=3, int thickness=1) { 
      std::vector&lt;cv::Point&gt;::const_iterator it= points.begin(); 
  
      // for all corners 
      while (it!=points.end()) { 
 
        // draw a circle at each corner location 
        cv::circle(image,*it,radius,color,thickness); 
        ++it; 
      } 
    } 
</pre><p class="calibre8">Using this class, the detection of the Harris points is accomplished as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Create Harris detector instance 
    HarrisDetector harris; 
    // Compute Harris values 
    harris.detect(image); 
    // Detect Harris corners 
    std::vector&lt;cv::Point&gt; pts; 
    harris.getCorners(pts,0.02); 
    // Draw Harris corners 
    harris.drawOnImage(image,pts); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">This results in the following image:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How to do it..." src="graphics/B05388_08_03.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p></div><div class="calibre1" title="How it works..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec155" class="calibre6"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">To define the notion of corners in images, the Harris feature detector looks at the average directional change in intensity in a small window around a putative interest point. If we consider a displacement vector, <code class="literal">(u,v)</code>, the intensity change can be measured by a sum of squared difference:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/B05388_08_17.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">The summation is over a defined neighborhood around the considered pixel (the size of this neighborhood corresponds to the third parameter in the <code class="literal">cv::cornerHarris</code> function). This average intensity change can then be computed in all possible directions, which leads to the definition of a corner as a point for which the average change is high in more than one direction. From this definition, the Harris test is performed as follows: We first obtain the direction of the maximal average intensity change. Next, we check whether the average intensity change in the orthogonal direction is high as well. If this is the case, then we have a corner.</p><p class="calibre8">Mathematically, this condition can be tested by using an approximation of the preceding formula using the Taylor expansion:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/B05388_08_18-1.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">This is then rewritten in matrix form:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/B05388_08_19.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">This matrix is a covariance matrix that characterizes the rate of intensity change in all directions. This definition involves the image's first derivatives that are often computed using the Sobel operator. This is the case with the OpenCV implementation, in which the fourth parameter of the function corresponds to the aperture used for the computation of the Sobel filters. It can be shown that the two eigenvalues of the covariance matrix give you the maximal average intensity change and the average intensity change for the orthogonal direction. Then, if these two eigenvalues are low, we are in a relatively homogenous region. If one eigenvalue is high and the other is low, we must be on an edge. Finally, if both eigenvalues are high, then we are at a corner location. Therefore, the condition for a point to be accepted as a corner is to have the smallest eigenvalue of its covariance matrix higher than a given threshold.</p><p class="calibre8">The original definition of the Harris corner algorithm uses some properties of the eigen decomposition theory in order to avoid the cost of explicitly computing the eigenvalues. These properties are as follows:</p><div class="calibre1"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The product of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its determinant</li><li class="listitem">The sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to the sum of the diagonal of the matrix (also known as the trace of the matrix)</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">It then follows that we can verify whether the eigenvalues of a matrix are high by computing the following score:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/B05388_08_20.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">One can easily verify that this score will indeed be high only if both eigenvalues are high too. This is the score that is computed by the <code class="literal">cv::cornerHarris</code> function at each pixel location. The value of <code class="literal">k</code> is specified as the fifth parameter of the function. It could be difficult to determine what value is best for this parameter. However, in practice, a value in the range of <code class="literal">0.05</code> and <code class="literal">0.5</code> generally gives good results.</p><p class="calibre8">To improve the result of the detection, the class described in the previous section adds an additional non-maxima suppression step. The goal here is to exclude Harris corners that are adjacent to others. Therefore, to be accepted, the Harris corner must not only have a score higher than the specified threshold, but it must also be a local maximum. This condition is tested by using a simple trick that consists of dilating the image of the Harris score in our <code class="literal">detect</code> method:</p><pre class="programlisting">    cv::dilate(cornerStrength, dilated,cv::Mat()); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">Since the dilation replaces each pixel value with the maximum in the defined neighborhood, the only points that will not be modified are the local maxima. This is what is verified by the following equality test:</p><pre class="programlisting">    cv::compare(cornerStrength, dilated, localMax,cv::CMP_EQ); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">The <code class="literal">localMax</code> matrix will therefore be true (that is, non-zero) only at local maxima locations. We then use it in our <code class="literal">getCornerMap</code> method to suppress all non-maximal features (using the <code class="literal">cv::bitwise</code> function).</p></div><div class="calibre1" title="There's more..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec156" class="calibre6"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Additional improvements can be made to the original Harris corner algorithm. This section describes another corner detector found in OpenCV, which expands the Harris detector to make its corners more uniformly distributed across the image. As we will see, this operator implements a generic interface defining the behavior of all feature detection operators. This interface allows easy testing of different interest point detectors within the same application.</p><div class="calibre1" title="Good features to track"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h3 class="title3"><a id="ch08lvl3sec33" class="calibre6"/>Good features to track</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">With the advent of floating-point processors, the mathematical simplification introduced to avoid eigenvalue decomposition has become negligible, and consequently, the detection of Harris corners can be made based on the explicitly computed eigenvalues. In principle, this modification should not significantly affect the result of the detection, but it avoids the use of the arbitrary <code class="literal">k</code> parameter. Note that two functions exist that allow you to explicitly get the eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) of the Harris covariance matrix; these are <code class="literal">cv::cornerEigenValsAndVecs</code> and <code class="literal">cv::cornerMinEigenVal</code>.</p><p class="calibre8">A second modification addresses the problem of feature point clustering. Indeed, in spite of the introduction of the local maxima condition, interest points tend to be unevenly distributed across an image, showing concentrations at highly textured locations. A solution to this problem is to impose a minimum distance between two interest points. This can be achieved using the following algorithm. Starting from the point with the strongest Harris score (that is, with the largest minimum eigenvalue), only accept interest points if they are located at, at least, a given distance from the already accepted points. This solution is implemented in OpenCV by the <span><strong class="calibre15">good-features-to-track</strong></span> (<span><strong class="calibre15">GFTT</strong></span>) operator, which is thus named because the features it detects can be used as a good starting set in visual tracking applications. This operator is deployed as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Compute good features to track 
    std::vector&lt;cv::KeyPoint&gt; keypoints; 
    // GFTT detector 
    cv::Ptr&lt;cv::GFTTDetector&gt; ptrGFTT =  
        cv::GFTTDetector::create( 
                        500,   // maximum number of keypoints
                        0.01,  // quality level 
                        10);   //minimum allowed distance between points 
    // detect the GFTT 
    ptrGFTT-&gt;detect(image,keypoints); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">The first step is to create the feature detector using the appropriate static function (here, <code class="literal">cv::GFTTDetector::create</code>) and the initialization parameters. In addition to the quality-level threshold value, and the minimum tolerated distance between interest points, the function also uses a maximum number of points that can be returned (this is possible since points are accepted in the order of strength). Calling this function returns a OpenCV smart pointer to the detector instance. Once this object constructed, its <code class="literal">detect</code> method can be called. Note that the common interface also includes the definition of a <code class="literal">cv::Keypoint</code> class that encapsulates the properties of each detected feature point. For the Harris corners, only the position of the keypoints and its response strength is relevant. The <span><em class="calibre16">Detecting scale-invariant features</em></span> recipe of this chapter will discuss the other properties that can be associated with a keypoint.</p><p class="calibre8">The preceding code produces the following result:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Good features to track" src="graphics/B05388_08_04.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">This approach increases the complexity of the detection, since it requires the interest points to be sorted by their Harris score, but it also clearly improves the distribution of the points across the image. Note that this function also includes an optional flag, that requests Harris corners to be detected using the classical corner score definition (using the covariance matrix determinant and trace).</p><p class="calibre8">The OpenCV common interface for the feature detector defines an abstract class called <code class="literal">cv::Feature2D</code> that basically imposes, among others, the existence of a <code class="literal">detect</code> operation with the following signatures:</p><pre class="programlisting">    void detect( cv::InputArray image,  
                 std::vector&lt;KeyPoint&gt;&amp; keypoints,  
                 cv::InputArray mask ); 
 
    void detect( cv::InputArrayOfArrays images,                 
                 std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;KeyPoint&gt; &gt;&amp; keypoints,          
                 cv::InputArrayOfArrays masks ); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">The second method allows interest points to be detected in a vector of images. The class also includes other methods such as the ones to compute feature descriptors (to be discussed in the next chapter) and the ones can read and write the detected points in a file.</p></div></div><div class="calibre1" title="See also"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec157" class="calibre6"/>See also</h2></div></div></div><div class="calibre1"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The classic article that describes the Harris operator by <span><em class="calibre16">C.

This time, this definition is based on the image intensity around a putative feature point. The decision to accept a keypoint is taken by examining a circle of pixels centered at a candidate point. If an arc of contiguous points of a length greater than three quarters of the circle perimeter in which all pixels significantly differ from the intensity of the center point (being all darker or all brighter) is found, then a keypoint is declared.</p><p class="calibre8">This is a simple test that can be computed quickly. Moreover, in its original formulation, the algorithm uses an additional trick to further speed up the process. Indeed, if we first test four points separated by 90 degrees on the circle (for example, top, bottom, right, and left points), it can be easily shown that in order to satisfy the condition expressed previously, at least three of these points must all be brighter or darker than the central pixel.</p><p class="calibre8">If this is not the case, the point can be rejected immediately, without inspecting additional points on the circumference. This is a very effective test, since in practice, most of the image points will be rejected by this simple 4-comparison test.</p><p class="calibre8">In principle, the radius of the circle of examined pixels could have been a parameter of the method. However, it has been found that in practice, a radius of <code class="literal">3</code> gives you both good results and high efficiency. There are, then, <code class="literal">16</code> pixels that need to be considered on the circumference of the circle, shown as follows:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/B05388_08_06.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">The four points used for the pretest are pixels <span><strong class="calibre15">1</strong></span>, <span><strong class="calibre15">5</strong></span>, <span><strong class="calibre15">9</strong></span>, and <span><strong class="calibre15">13</strong></span>, and the required number of contiguous darker or brighter points is <span><strong class="calibre15">9</strong></span>. This specific setting is often designated as the FAST-9 corner detector, and this the one OpenCV uses by default. You can, in fact, specify which type of FAST detector you want to use when you construct the detector instance; there is also a <code class="literal">setType</code> method. The options are <code class="literal">cv::FastFeatureDetector::TYPE_5_8</code>, <code class="literal">cv::FastFeatureDetector::TYPE_7_12</code>, and <code class="literal">cv::FastFeatureDetector::TYPE_9_16</code>.</p><p class="calibre8">To be considered as being significantly darker or brighter, the intensity of a point must differ from the intensity of the central pixel by at least a given amount; this value corresponds to the threshold parameter specified when creating the detector instance. The larger this threshold is, the fewer corner points will be detected.</p><p class="calibre8">As for Harris features, it is often better to perform non-maxima suppression on the corners that have been found. Therefore, a corner strength measure needs to be defined. Several alternative measures to this can considered, and the one that has been retained is the following. The strength of a corner is given by the sum of the absolute difference between the central pixel and the pixels on the identified contiguous arc. You can read the corner strength from the <code class="literal">response</code> attribute of the <code class="literal">cv::KeyPoint</code> instances.</p><p class="calibre8">This algorithm results in very fast interest point detection and is therefore the feature of choice when speed is a concern. This is the case, for example, in real-time visual tracking or object-recognition applications where several points must be tracked or matched in a live video stream.</p></div><div class="calibre1" title="There's more..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec160" class="calibre6"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Different strategies can be used to make feature detection more suitable for your application.</p><p class="calibre8">For example, it is sometimes desirable to dynamically adapt the feature detection such to obtain a predefined number of interest points. A simple strategy to achieve this goal consists in using a permissive detection threshold such that a large number of interest points is obtained. You then simply have to extract the nth strongest points in the set. A standard C++ function allows you to accomplish this:</p><pre class="programlisting">    if (numberOfPoints &lt; keypoints.size()) 
      std::nth_element(keypoints.begin(),
                       keypoints.begin() + numberOfPoints,
                       keypoints.end(),
                       [](cv::KeyPoint&amp; a, cv::KeyPoint&amp; b) { 
                       return a.response &gt; b.response; }); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">Here, <code class="literal">keypoints</code> is your <code class="literal">std::vector</code> of detected interest points and <code class="literal">numberOfPoints</code> is the desirable quantity of interest points. The last parameter in this function is the lambda comparator used to extract the best interest points. Note that if the number of detected interest points is too low (that is, lower than the seek quantity), this means that you should have used a lower threshold for detection. However, using a very permissive threshold generally increases the computational load; there is therefore a trade-off value that has to be identified.</p><p class="calibre8">Another issue that often arises when detecting features, is the uneven distribution of the interest points over an image. Indeed, the <code class="literal">keypoints</code> tend to agglomerate at highly textured areas of the image. For example, here is the result obtained when detecting <code class="literal">100</code> interest points on our church image:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="There's more..." src="graphics/B05388_08_07.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">As you can see, most feature points are on the upper and bottom parts of the building. A common strategy used to obtain a better distribution of the interest points in an image consists in dividing this one into a grid of sub-images and perform an independent detection of each sub-image. The following code performs this grid adapted detection:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // The final vector of keypoints 
    keypoints.clear(); 
    // detect on each grid 
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; vstep; i++) 
      for (int j = 0; j &lt; hstep; j++) { 
        // create ROI over current grid 
        imageROI = image(cv::Rect(j*hsize, i*vsize, hsize, vsize)); 
        // detect the keypoints in grid 
        gridpoints.clear(); 
        ptrFAST-&gt;detect(imageROI, gridpoints); 
 
        // get the strongest FAST features 
        auto itEnd(gridpoints.end()); 
        if (gridpoints.size() &gt; subtotal) {  
          // select the strongest features 
          std::nth_element(gridpoints.begin(),
                           gridpoints.begin() + subtotal, 
                           gridpoints.end(),
                           [](cv::KeyPoint&amp; a,
                           cv::KeyPoint&amp; b) { 
            return a.response &gt; b.response; }); 
          itEnd = gridpoints.begin() + subtotal; 
        } 
 
        // add them to the global keypoint vector 
        for (auto it = gridpoints.begin(); it != itEnd; ++it) { 
          // convert to image coordinates 
          it-&gt;pt += cv::Point2f(j*hsize, i*vsize);  
          keypoints.push_back(*it); 
      } 
    } 
</pre><p class="calibre8">The key idea here is to use image ROIs in order to perform keypoint detection inside each sub-image of the grid. The resulting detection shows a more uniform keypoint distribution:</p><p class="calibre8">

While orientation invariance, which is the ability to detect the same points even if an image is rotated, has been relatively well handled by the simple feature point detectors that have been presented so far, the invariance to scale changes is more difficult to achieve. To address this problem, the concept of scale-invariant features has been introduced in computer vision. The idea here is to not only have a consistent detection of keypoints no matter at which scale an object is pictured, but to also have a scale factor associated with each of the detected feature points. Ideally, for the same object point featured at two different scales on two different images, the ratio of the two computed scale factors should correspond to the ratio of their respective scales. In recent years, several scale-invariant features have been proposed, and this recipe presents one of them, the <span><strong class="calibre15">SURF</strong></span> features. SURF stands for <span><strong class="calibre15">Speeded Up Robust Features</strong></span>, and as we will see, they are not only scale-invariant features, but they also offer the advantage of being computed efficiently.</p><div class="calibre1" title="How to do it..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec162" class="calibre6"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">The SURF feature detector is part of the <code class="literal">opencv_contrib</code> repository. To use it, you must then have built the OpenCV library together with these extra modules, as explained in <a href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Playing with Images">
Chapter 1
</a>, <span><em class="calibre16">Playing with Images</em></span>. In particular, we are interested here by the <code class="literal">cv::xfeatures2d</code> module that gives us access to the <code class="literal">cv::xfeatures2d::SurfFeatureDetector</code> class. As for the other detector, interest points are detected by first creating an instance of the detector and then calling its <code class="literal">detect</code> method:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Construct the SURF feature detector object 
    cv::Ptr&lt;cv::xfeatures2d::SurfFeatureDetector&gt; ptrSURF =   
                cv::xfeatures2d::SurfFeatureDetector::create(2000.0); 
    // detect the keypoints 
    ptrSURF-&gt;detect(image, keypoints); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">To draw these features, we again use the <code class="literal">cv::drawKeypoints</code> OpenCV function but now with the <code class="literal">cv::DrawMatchesFlags::DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS</code> flag so that we can visualize the associated scale factor:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Draw the keypoints with scale and orientation information 
    cv::drawKeypoints(image,                     // original image 
               keypoints,                        // vector of keypoints 
               featureImage,                     // the resulting image 
               cv::Scalar(255,255,255),          // color of the points 
               cv::DrawMatchesFlags::DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS); 
</pre><p class="calibre8">The resulting image with the detected features is then as follows:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How to do it..." src="graphics/image_08_013.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">Here, the size of the keypoint circles resulting from the use of the <code class="literal">cv::DrawMatchesFlags::DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS</code> flag is proportional to the computed scale of each feature. The SURF algorithm also associates an orientation with each feature to make them invariant to rotations. This orientation is illustrated by a radial line inside each drawn circle.</p><p class="calibre8">If we take another picture of the same object but at a different scale, the feature-detection result is as follows:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How to do it..." src="graphics/image_08_014.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">By carefully observing the detected keypoints on the two images, it can be seen that the change in the size of corresponding circles is often proportional to the change in scale. As an example, consider the two windows on the right part of the church; in both images, a SURF feature has been detected at that location, and the two corresponding circles (of different sizes) contain the same visual elements. Of course, this is not the case for all features, but as we will discover in the next chapter, the repeatability rate is sufficiently high to allow good matching between the two images.</p></div><div class="calibre1" title="How it works..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec163" class="calibre6"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">In <a href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Filtering the Images">
Chapter 6
</a>, <span><em class="calibre16">Filtering the Images</em></span>, we learned that the derivatives of an image can be estimated using Gaussian filters. These filters make use of a <code class="literal">σ</code> parameter, which defines the aperture (size) of the kernel. As we saw, this <code class="literal">σ</code> parameter corresponds to the variance of the Gaussian function used to construct the filter, and it then implicitly defines a scale at which the derivative is evaluated. Indeed, a filter that has a larger <code class="literal">σ </code>value smooths out the finer details of the image. This is why we can say that it operates at a coarser scale.</p><p class="calibre8">Now, if we compute, for instance, the Laplacian of a given image point using Gaussian filters at different scales, then different values are obtained. Looking at the evolution of the filter response for different scale factors, we obtain a curve that eventually reaches a maximum value at a given <code class="literal">σ</code> value. If we extract this maximum value for two images of the same object taken at two different scales, the ratio of these two <code class="literal">σ</code> maxima should correspond to the ratio of the scales at which the images were taken. This important observation is at the core of the scale-invariant feature extraction process. That is, scale-invariant features should be detected as the local maxima in both the spatial space (in the image) and the scale space (as obtained from the derivative filters applied at different scales).</p><p class="calibre8">SURF implements this idea by proceeding as follows. First, to detect the features, the Hessian matrix is computed at each pixel. This matrix measures the local curvature of a function and is defined as follows:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/B05388_08_21.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">The determinant of this matrix gives you the strength of this curvature. The idea, therefore, is to define corners as image points with high local curvature (that is, high variation in more than one direction). Since it is composed of second-order derivatives, this matrix can be computed using Laplacian of Gaussian kernels of a different scale, that is, for different values of <code class="literal">σ</code>. This Hessian then becomes a function of three variables, <code class="literal">H(x,y,σ)</code>. Therefore, a scale-invariant feature is declared when the determinant of this Hessian reaches a local maximum in both spatial and scale space (that is, <code class="literal">3x3x3</code> non-maxima suppression needs to be performed). Note that in order to be considered as a valid point, this determinant must have a minimum value as specified by the first parameter of the <code class="literal">create</code> method of the <code class="literal">cv::xfeatures2d::SurfFeatureDetector</code> class.</p><p class="calibre8">However, the calculation of all of these derivatives at different scales is computationally costly. The objective of the SURF algorithm is to make this process as efficient as possible. This is achieved by using approximated Gaussian kernels that involve only few integer additions. These have the following structure:</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/image_08_016.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">The kernel on the left-hand side is used to estimate the mixed second derivatives, while the one on the right-hand side estimates the second derivative in the vertical direction. A rotated version of this second kernel estimates the second derivative in the horizontal direction. The smallest kernels have a size of <code class="literal">9x9</code> pixels, corresponding to <code class="literal">σ≈1.2</code>. To obtain a scale-space representation, kernels of increasing size are successively applied. The exact number of filters that are applied can be specified by additional parameters of the <code class="literal">cv::xfeatures2d::SurfFeatureDetector::create</code> method. By default, <code class="literal">12</code> different sizes of kernels are used (going up to size <code class="literal">99x99</code>). Note that, as explained in <a href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Counting the Pixels with Histograms">
Chapter 4
</a>, <span><em class="calibre16">Counting the Pixels with Histograms</em></span>, the use of integral images guarantees that the sum inside each lobe of each filter can be computed by using only three additions independent of the size of the filter.</p><p class="calibre8">Once the local maxima are identified, the precise position of each detected interest point is obtained through interpolation in both scale and image space. The result is then a set of feature points that are localized at sub-pixel accuracy and to which a scale value is associated.</p></div><div class="calibre1" title="There's more..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec164" class="calibre6"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">The SURF algorithm has been developed as an efficient variant of another well-known scale-invariant feature detector called <span><strong class="calibre15">SIFT</strong></span> (<span><strong class="calibre15">Scale-Invariant Feature Transform</strong></span>).</p><div class="calibre1" title="The SIFT feature-detection algorithm"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h3 class="title3"><a id="ch08lvl3sec34" class="calibre6"/>The SIFT feature-detection algorithm</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">SIFT also detects features as local maxima in the image and scale space, but uses the Laplacian filter response instead of the Hessian determinant.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="The SIFT feature-detection algorithm" src="graphics/image_08_018.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">Since the computation of the feature point is based on floating-point kernels, SIFT is generally considered to be more accurate in terms of feature localization in regards to space and scale.

This second aspect will be the subject of the next chapter. We describe here how the quick detection of keypoints at multiple scales is performed using BRISK.</p><p class="calibre8">In order to detect interest points at different scales, the method first builds an image pyramid through two down-sampling processes. The first process starts from the original image size and downscales it by half at each layer (or octave). Secondly, in-between layers are created by down-sampling the original image by a factor of <code class="literal">1.5</code>, and from this reduced image, additional layers are generated through successive half-sampling.</p><p class="calibre8">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="How it works..." src="graphics/image_08_020.jpg" class="calibre17"/></div><p class="calibre8">
</p><p class="calibre8">The FAST feature detector is then applied on all the images of this pyramid. Keypoint extraction is based on a criterion that is similar to the one used by SIFT. First, an acceptable interest point must be a local maximum, when comparing its strength with one of its eight spatial neighbors. If this is the case, the point is then compared with the scores of the neighboring points in the layers above and below; if its score is higher in scale as well, then it is accepted as an interest point. A key aspect of BRISK resides in the fact that the different layers of the pyramid have different resolutions. The method requires interpolation in both scale and space in order to locate each keypoint precisely. This interpolation is based on the FAST keypoint scores. In space, the interpolation is performed on a <code class="literal">3x3</code> neighborhood. In scale, it is computed by fitting a 1D parabola along the scale axis through the current point and its two neighboring local keypoints in the layers above and below; this keypoint localization in scale is illustrated in the preceding figure. As a result, even if the FAST keypoint detection is performed at discrete image scales, the resulting detected scales associated with each keypoint are continuous values.</p><p class="calibre8">The <code class="literal">cv::BRISK</code> detector has two main parameters. The first one is a threshold value for FAST keypoints to be accepted, and the second parameter is the number of octaves that will be generated in the image pyramid; in our example, we used <code class="literal">5</code> octaves, which explains the large number of scales in the detected keypoints.</p></div><div class="calibre1" title="There's more..."><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec168" class="calibre6"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">BRISK is not the only multiscale, fast detector that is proposed in OpenCV. Another one is the ORB feature detector that can also perform efficient keypoint detection.</p><div class="calibre1" title="The ORB feature-detection algorithm"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h3 class="title3"><a id="ch08lvl3sec35" class="calibre6"/>The ORB feature-detection algorithm</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">ORB stands for Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF. The first part of this acronym refers to the keypoint detection part, while the second part refers to the descriptor that is proposed by ORB. Here, we focus on the detection method; the descriptor will be presented in the next chapter.</p><p class="calibre8">As with BRISK, ORB first creates an image pyramid. This one is made of a number of layers each of which being a down-sampled version of the previous one by a certain scale factor (typically, <code class="literal">8</code> scales and <code class="literal">1.2</code> scale factor reduction; these are the default parameter values when creating a <code class="literal">cv::ORB</code> detector). The strongest <code class="literal">N</code> keypoints are then accepted where the keypoint score is defined by the Harris cornerness measure, as defined in the first recipe of this chapter (the authors of this method found the Harris score to be a more reliable measure than the usual FAST corner strength).</p><p class="calibre8">An original aspect of the ORB detector resides in the fact that an orientation is associated with each detected interest point. As we will see in the next chapter, this information will be useful to align the descriptors of keypoints detected in different images. In the <span><em class="calibre16">Computing components' shape descriptors</em></span> recipe of <a href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Extracting Lines, Contours, and Components">
Chapter 7
</a>, <span><em class="calibre16">Extracting Lines, Contours, and Components</em></span>, we introduced the concept of image moments and in particular, we showed you how the centroid of a component can be computed from its first three moments. ORB proposes to use the orientation of the centroid of a circular neighborhood around the keypoint. Since, FAST keypoints, by definition, always have a decentered centroid, the angle of the line that joins the central point and the centroid will always be well defined.</p><p class="calibre8">The ORB features are detected as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">    // Construct the ORB feature detector object 
    cv::Ptr&lt;cv::ORB&gt; ptrORB =  
      cv::ORB::create(75,  // total number of keypoints 
                      1.2, // scale factor between layers 
                      8);  // number of layers in pyramid 
    // detect the keypoints 
    ptrORB-&gt;detect(image, keypoints);

</p><p class="calibre8">As can be seen, since the keypoints are independently detected on each pyramid layer, the detector tends to repeatedly detect the same feature point at different scales.</p></div></div><div class="calibre1" title="See also"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><div class="calibre1"><h2 class="title2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec169" class="calibre6"/>See also</h2></div></div></div><div class="calibre1"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <span><em class="calibre16">Matching keypoints with binary descriptors</em></span> recipe in <a href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Describing and Matching Interest Points">
