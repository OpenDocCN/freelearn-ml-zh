<p class="mce-root">The new vSphere Scale-Out edition is specifically designed for running <strong>high-performance computing</strong><span> (</span><strong>HPC</strong><span>)</span> and big data workloads. We have to ensure that HPC and big data performance and other requirements can be met either by development or by fine-tuning guidelines with our mainstream products. This vSphere edition comes with a feature set that has been adjusted to align with these two Scale-Out workload types, HPC and big data, and at a competitive cost. It packages all the core vSphere features required for big data and HPC workloads and is sold in packs of 8 CPUs. Key features included in the vSphere Scale-Out edition include ESXi hypervisor, vMotion, Storage vMotion, Host Profiles, Auto Deploy, and Distributed Switch.</p>
