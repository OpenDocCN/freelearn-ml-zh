- en: This book is an introduction to the world of machine learning, a topic that
    is becoming more and more important, not only for IT professionals and analysts
    but also for all those scientists and engineers who want to exploit the enormous
    power of techniques such as predictive analysis, classification, clustering and
    natural language processing. Of course, it's impossible to cover all the details
    with the appropriate precision; for this reason, some topics are only briefly
    described, giving the user the double opportunity to focus only on some fundamental
    concepts and, through the references, examine in depth all those elements that
    will generate much interest. I apologize in advance for any imprecision or mistakes,
    and I'd like to thank all Packt editors for their collaboration and constant attention.
