    are integral parts of business strategy for many organizations, and more organizations
    are using them every year. The major reason for this adoption is the power of
    ML and AI solutions to garner more revenue, brand value, and cost savings. This
    increase in the adoption of AI and ML demands more skilled data and ML specialists
    and technical leaders. If you are an ML practitioner or beginner, this book will
    help you become a confident ML engineer or data scientist with knowledge of Google’s
    best practices. In this chapter, we will discuss the basics of the life cycle
    and the challenges and limitations of ML when developing real-world applications.

- en: A real-world ML project is always filled with some unexpected challenges that
    we get to experience at different stages. The main reason for this is that the
    data present in the real world, and the ML algorithms, are not perfect. Though
    these challenges hamper the performance of the overall ML setup, they don’t prevent
    us from creating a valuable ML application. In a new ML project, it is difficult
    to know the challenges up front. They are often found during different stages
    of the project. Some of these challenges are not obvious and require skilled or
    experienced ML practitioners (or data scientists) to identify them and apply countermeasures
    to reduce their effect.

- en: One of the most common challenges that organizations face is data availability.
    ML algorithms require a large amount of good-quality data in order to provide
    quality results. Thus, the availability of raw data is critical for a business
    if it wants to implement ML. Sometimes, even if the raw data is available, gathering
    data is not the only concern; we often need to transform or process the data in
    a way that our ML algorithm supports.

  zh: 组织面临的最常见挑战之一是数据可用性。机器学习算法需要大量高质量的数据才能提供高质量的结果。因此，对于想要实施机器学习的业务来说，原始数据的可用性至关重要。有时，即使原始数据可用，收集数据也不是唯一的问题；我们通常需要以我们的机器学习算法支持的方式转换或处理数据。
- en: Data security is another important challenge that is very frequently faced by
    ML developers. When we get data from a company, it is essential to differentiate
    between sensitive and non-sensitive information to implement ML correctly and
    efficiently. The sensitive part of data needs to be stored in fully secured servers
    (storage systems) and should always be kept encrypted. Sensitive data should be
    avoided for security purposes, and only the less-sensitive data access should
    be given to trusted team members working on the project. If the data contains
    **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**), it can still be used by anonymizing
    it properly.

  zh: 数据安全是机器学习开发者经常面临的一个重要挑战。当我们从一家公司获取数据时，为了正确和高效地实施机器学习，区分敏感和非敏感信息是至关重要的。数据敏感部分需要存储在完全安全的服务器（存储系统）中，并且始终应保持加密。出于安全目的，应避免使用敏感数据，并且只应将不太敏感的数据访问权限授予在项目上工作的可信团队成员。如果数据包含**个人身份信息**（**PII**），则可以通过适当匿名化来使用。

  zh: 非代表性训练数据
- en: A good ML model is one that performs equally well on unseen data and training
    data. It is only possible when your training data is a good representative of
    most possible business scenarios. Sometimes, when the dataset is small, it may
    not be a true representative of the inherent distribution, and the resulting model
    may provide inaccurate predictions on unseen datasets despite having high-quality
    results on the training dataset. This kind of non-representative data is either
    the result of sampling bias or the unavailability of data. Thus, an ML model trained
    on such a non-representative dataset may have less value when it is deployed in
    production.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一个好的机器学习模型是在未见数据集和训练数据集上表现同样出色的模型。只有在你的训练数据是大多数可能业务场景的良好代表时，这才能实现。有时，当数据集较小时，它可能不是固有分布的真实代表，并且尽管在训练数据集上具有高质量的结果，但该模型在未见数据集上可能提供不准确的预测。这种非代表性数据要么是采样偏差的结果，要么是数据不可用。因此，在非代表性数据集上训练的机器学习模型在生产部署时可能价值较低。
- en: If it is impossible to get a true representative training dataset for a business
    problem, then it’s better to limit the scope of the problem to only the scenarios
    for which we have a sufficient amount of training samples. In this way, we will
    only get known scenarios in the unseen dataset, and the model should provide quality
    predictions. Sometimes, the data related to a business problem keeps changing
    with time, and it may not be possible to develop a single static model that works
    well; in such cases, continuous retraining of the model on the latest data becomes
    essential.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果无法为业务问题获取真实代表性的训练数据集，那么最好将问题范围限制在我们有足够训练样本的场景。这样，我们将在未见数据集中只获得已知场景，并且模型应该提供高质量的预测。有时，与业务问题相关的数据会随着时间的推移而不断变化，可能无法开发一个单一静态的模型来很好地工作；在这种情况下，对模型进行持续重新训练以使用最新数据变得至关重要。

  zh: 数据质量差
- en: The performance of ML algorithms is very sensitive to the quality of training
    samples. A small number of outliers, missing data cases, or some abnormal scenarios
    can affect the quality of the model significantly. So, it is important to treat
    such scenarios carefully while analyzing the data before training any ML algorithm.
    There are multiple methods for identifying and treating outliers; the best method
    depends upon the nature of the problem and the data itself. Similarly, there are
    multiple ways of treating the missing values as well. For example, mean, median,
    mode, and so on are some frequently used methods to fill in missing data. If the
    training data size is sufficiently large, dropping a small number of rows with
    missing values is also a good option.

  zh: 机器学习算法的性能对训练样本的质量非常敏感。少数异常值、缺失数据案例或一些异常情况可能会显著影响模型的质量。因此，在训练任何机器学习算法之前，在分析数据时仔细处理这些情况非常重要。有多种方法用于识别和处理异常值；最佳方法取决于问题的性质和数据本身。同样，也有多种处理缺失值的方法。例如，均值、中位数、众数等是一些常用的方法来填充缺失数据。如果训练数据量足够大，删除少量带有缺失值的行也是一个不错的选择。
- en: As discussed, the quality of the training dataset is important if we want our
    ML system to learn accurately and provide quality results on the unseen dataset.

  zh: 欠拟合训练数据集
- en: Underfitting an ML model means that the model is too simple to learn the inherent
    information or structure of the training dataset. It may occur when we try to
    fit a non-linear distribution using a linear ML algorithm such as linear regression.
    Underfitting may also occur when we utilize only a minimal set of features (that
    may not have much information about the target distribution) while training the
    model. This type of model can be too simple to learn the target distribution.
    An underfitted model learns too little from the training data and, thus, makes
    mistakes on unseen or test datasets.

  zh: 欠拟合机器学习模型意味着模型过于简单，无法学习训练数据集的固有信息或结构。这可能发生在我们尝试使用如线性回归这样的线性机器学习算法来拟合非线性分布时。当我们在训练模型时仅使用最小特征集（这些特征可能对目标分布的信息不多）时，也可能发生欠拟合。这种类型的模型可能过于简单，无法学习目标分布。欠拟合的模型从训练数据中学习得太少，因此在对未见或测试数据集的错误判断上。

- en: The overfitting problem is the opposite of the underfitting problem. Overfitting
    is the scenario when the ML model learns too much unnecessary information from
    the training data and fails to generalize on a test or unseen dataset. In this
    case, the model performs extremely well on the training dataset, but the metric
    value (such as accuracy) is very low on the test set. Overfitting usually occurs
    when we implement a very complex algorithm on simple datasets.

  zh: 过拟合问题与欠拟合问题是相反的。过拟合是机器学习模型从训练数据中学习太多不必要信息，并且无法在测试或未见数据集上进行泛化的场景。在这种情况下，模型在训练数据集上表现极好，但指标值（如准确率）在测试集上非常低。过拟合通常发生在我们在简单数据集上实现一个非常复杂的算法时。

- en: ML is expensive. A typical ML project often involves crunching large datasets
    with millions or billions of samples. Slicing and dicing such datasets requires
    a lot of memory and high-end multi-core processors. Additionally, once the development
    of the project is complete, dedicated servers are required to deploy the models
    and match the scale of consumers. Thus, business organizations willing to practice
    ML need some dedicated infrastructure to implement and consume ML efficiently.
    This requirement increases further when working with large, deep learning models
    such as transformers, **large language models** (**LLMs**), and so on. Such models
    usually require a set of accelerators, **graphical processing units** (**GPUs**),
    or **tensor processing units (TPUs**) for training, finetuning, and deployment.

    ML can’t be applied due to technical or business constraints. As an ML practitioner,
    it is important to develop the ability to find relevant business problems where
    ML can provide significant value instead of applying it blindly everywhere. Additionally,
    there are algorithm-specific limitations that can render an ML solution not applicable
    in some business applications. In this section, we will learn about some common
    limitations of ML that should be kept in mind while finding relevant use cases.

- en: The quality of an ML model highly depends upon the quality of the training data
    it is provided with. Data present in the real world is often noisy, incomplete,
    unlabeled, and sometimes unusable. Moreover, most supervised learning algorithms
    require large amounts of properly labeled training data to produce good results.
    The training data requirements of some algorithms (e.g., deep learning) are so
    high that even manually labeling data is not an option. And even if we manage
    to label the data manually, it is often error-prone due to human bias.

- en: Another major issue is incompleteness or missing data. For example, consider
    the problem of automatic speech recognition. In this case, model results are highly
    biased toward the accent present in the training dataset. A model that is trained
    on the American accent doesn’t produce good results on other accented speech.
    Since accents change significantly as we travel to different parts of the world,
    it is hard to gather and label relevant amounts of training data for every possible
    accent. For this reason, developing a single speech recognition model that works
    for everyone is not yet feasible, and thus, the tech giants providing speech recognition
    solutions often develop accent-specific models. Developing a new model for each
    new accent is not very scalable.

    as numerical weather prediction. One problem with most of the current ML algorithms
    is that they are stochastic in nature and thus cannot be trusted blindly when
    the problem is deterministic. Considering the case of numerical weather prediction,
    today we have ML models that can predict rain, wind speed, air pressure, and so
    on, with acceptable accuracy, but they completely fail to understand the physics
    behind real weather systems. For example, an ML model might provide negative value
    estimations of parameters such as density.

- en: One major issue with many ML algorithms (and often with neural networks) is
    the lack of interpretability of results. Many business applications, such as fraud
    detection and disease prediction, require a justification for model results. If
    an ML model classifies a financial transaction as fraud, it should also provide
    solid evidence for the decision; otherwise, this output may not be useful for
    the business. Deep learning or neural network models often lack interpretability,
    and the explainability of such models is an active area of research. Multiple
    methods have been developed for model interpretability or explainability purposes.
    Though these methods can provide some insights into the results, they are still
    far from the actual requirements.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reproducibility, on the other hand, is another complex and growing issue with
    ML solutions. Some of the latest research papers might show us great improvements
    in results using some technological advancements on a fixed set of datasets, but
    the same method may not work in real-world scenarios. Secondly, ML models are
    often unstable, which means that they produce different results when trained on
    different partitions of the dataset. This is a challenging situation because models
    developed for one business segment may be completely useless for another business
    segment, even though the underlying problem statement is similar. This makes them
    less reusable.

- en: Developing and maintaining ML solutions is often expensive, more so in the case
    of deep learning algorithms. Development costs may come from employing highly
    skilled developers as well as the infrastructure needed for data analytics and
    ML experimentation. Deep learning models usually require high-compute resources
    such as GPUs and TPUs for training and experimentation. Running a hyperparameter
    tuning job with such models is even more costly and time-consuming. Once the model
    is ready for production, it requires dedicated resources for deployment, monitoring,
    and maintenance. This cost further increases as you scale your deployments to
    serve a large number of customers, and even more if there are very low latency
    concerns. Thus, it is very important to understand the value that our solution
    is going to bring before jumping into the development phase and check whether
    it is worth the investment.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another concern with the ML solutions is their lack of customizations. ML models
    are often very difficult to customize, meaning it can be hard to change their
    parameters or make them adapt to new datasets. Pre-built general-purpose ML solutions
    often do not work well on specific business use cases, and this leaves them with
    two choices – either to develop the solution from scratch or customize the prebuilt
    general-purpose solutions. Though the customization of prebuilt models seems like
    a better choice here, even the customization is not easy in the case of ML models.
    ML model customization requires a skilled set of data engineers and ML specialists
    with a deep understanding of technical concepts such as deep learning, predictive
    modeling, and transfer learning.

    business strategy and decisions. As we know, some of these ML algorithms are *black
    boxes*; they may not provide reasons behind their decisions. ML systems are trained
    on a finite set of datasets, and they may not apply to some real-world scenarios;
    if those scenarios are encountered in the future, we can’t tell what decision
    the ML system will take. There might be ethical concerns related to such black-box
    decisions. For example, if a self-driving car is involved in a road accident,
    whom should you blame – the driver, the team that developed the AI system, or
    the car manufacturer? Thus, it is clear that the current advancements in ML and
    AI are not suitable for ethical or moral decision-making. Also, we need a framework
    to solve ethical concerns involving ML and AI systems.

- en: The accuracy and speed of ML solutions are often commendable, but these solutions
    cannot always be trusted to be fair and unbiased. Consider AI software that recognizes
    faces or objects in a given image; this system could go wrong on photos where
    the camera is not able to capture racial sensitivity properly, or it may classify
    a certain type of dog (that is somewhat similar to a cat) as a cat. This kind
    of bias may come from a biased set of training or testing datasets used for developing
    AI systems. Data present in the real world is often collected and labeled by humans;
    thus, the bias that exists in humans is transferred into AI systems. Avoiding
    bias completely is impossible as we all are humans and are thus biased, but there
    are measures that can be taken to reduce it. Establishing a culture of ethics
    and building teams from diverse backgrounds can be a good step to reduce bias
    to a certain extent.
