- en: This part introduces the main concepts behind the quantum circuit model. You
    will learn how qubits store information, how to operate on that information with
    quantum gates, and how to obtain results with quantum measurements. You will also
    learn about some of the most important tools currently used to program quantum
    computers. In particular, we will discuss how to implement and execute quantum
    circuits with Qiskit and PennyLane.
