- en: Few data scientists would agree on specific tools and techniques—and there are
    multiple ways to perform the exploratory data analysis, ranging from Unix command
    line to using very popular open source and commercial ETL and visualization tools.
    The focus of this chapter is how to use Scala and a laptop-based environment to
    benefit from techniques that are commonly referred as a functional paradigm of
    programming. As I will discuss, these techniques can be transferred to exploratory
    analysis over distributed system of machines using Hadoop/Spark.

  zh: 很少有数据科学家会就特定的工具和技术达成一致意见——进行探索性数据分析有多种方法，从 Unix 命令行到使用非常流行的开源和商业 ETL 和可视化工具。本章的重点是如何使用
    Scala 和基于笔记本电脑的环境来利用通常被称为编程的函数式范式的技术。正如我将讨论的，这些技术可以转移到使用 Hadoop/Spark 的分布式机器系统上的探索性分析中。
- en: What has functional programming to do with it? Spark was developed in Scala
    for a good reason. Many basic principles that lie at the foundation of functional
    programming, such as lazy evaluation, immutability, absence of side effects, list
    comprehensions, and monads go really well with processing data in distributed
    environments, specifically, when performing the data preparation and transformation
    tasks on big data. Thanks to abstractions, these techniques work well on a local
    workstation or a laptop. As mentioned earlier, this does not preclude us from
    processing very large datasets up to dozens of TBs on modern laptops connected
    to distributed clusters of storage/processing nodes. We can do it one topic or
    focus area at the time, but often we even do not have to sample or filter the
    dataset with proper partitioning. We will use Scala as our primary tool, but will
    resort to other tools if required.

  zh: 函数式编程与这有什么关系？Spark 是用 Scala 开发的，这并非没有原因。许多位于函数式编程基础之上的基本原则，如惰性评估、不可变性、无副作用、列表推导和单子，非常适合在分布式环境中处理数据，特别是在对大数据进行数据准备和转换任务时。得益于抽象，这些技术在本地工作站或笔记本电脑上也能很好地工作。如前所述，这并不妨碍我们在连接到分布式存储/处理节点集群的现代笔记本电脑上处理数十
    TB 的非常大的数据集。我们可以一次处理一个主题或关注领域，但通常我们甚至不需要对数据集进行适当的分区采样或过滤。我们将使用 Scala 作为我们的主要工具，但在需要时也会求助于其他工具。
- en: While Scala is complete in the sense that everything that can be implemented
    in other languages can be implemented in Scala, Scala is fundamentally a high-level,
    or even a scripting, language. One does not have to deal with low-level details
    of data structures and algorithm implementations that in their majority have already
    been tested by a plethora of applications and time, in, say, Java or C++—even
    though Scala has its own collections and even some basic algorithm implementations
    today. Specifically, in this chapter, I'll be focusing on using Scala/Spark only
    for high-level tasks.

    removing the computational bottleneck, except, maybe in cases where compression
    is implemented implicitly in hardware (SSD, where we don't need to compress the

    are never going to provide any rewards. The UCB strategy improves the epsilon
    strategy by choosing an arm with the largest estimate of the return, plus some
    multiple or fraction of the standard deviation of the return estimates. The approach
    needs the recomputation of the best arm to pull at each round and suffers from
    approximations made to estimate the mean and standard deviation. Besides, UCB
    requires the recomputation of the estimates for each successive pull, which might

    processing usually requires much more resources dedicated to processing, as it
    is more expensive to process individual records at a time as opposed to batches
    of records, even if it is tens or hundreds of records. So, the architect needs
    to justify the additional costs based on the value of more recent result, which
    is not always warranted. Second, stream processing requires a few adjustments
    to the architecture as handling the more recent data becomes a priority; for example,
    a delta architecture where the more recent data is handled by a separate substream

    is also an optimization problem to minimize cost functional, given a set of differential
    equations describing the system. An optimal control is a set of control policies
    to minimize the cost functional given constraints. For example, the problem might
    be to find a way to drive the car to minimize its fuel consumption, given that
    it must complete a given course in a time not exceeding some amount. Another control
    problem is to maximize profit for showing ads on a website, provided the inventory

    other languages such as C or MATLAB (PROPT, SNOPT, RIOTS, DIDO, DIRECT, and GPOPS),
    but can be interfaced with Scala.

    maker. In MDPs, we deal with a discrete set of possible states and a set of actions.

- en: In this chapter, I described a high-level architecture and approach to design
    a data-driven enterprise. I also introduced you to influence diagrams, a tool
    for understanding how the decisions are made in traditional and data-driven enterprises.
    I stopped on a few key models, such as Kelly Criterion and multi-armed bandit,
    essential to demonstrate the issues from the mathematical point of view. I built
    on top of this to introduce some Markov decision process approaches where we deal
    with decision policies based on the results of the previous decisions and observations.
    I delved into more practical aspects of building a data pipeline for decision-making,
    describing major components and frameworks that can be used to built them. I also
    discussed the issues of communicating the data and modeling results between different
    stages and nodes, presenting the results to the user, feedback loop, and monitoring.

    learning fits in the global data-driven enterprise architecture, let's stop at
    the specific implementations in Spark and MLlib, a machine learning library on
    top of Spark. Spark is a relatively new member of the big data ecosystem that
    is optimized for memory usage as opposed to disk. The data can be still spilled
    to disk as necessary, but Spark does the spill only if instructed to do so explicitly,
    or if the active dataset does not fit into the memory. Spark stores lineage information
    to recompute the active dataset if a node goes down or the information is erased
    from memory for some other reason. This is in contrast to the traditional MapReduce
    approach, where the data is persisted to the disk after each map or reduce task.

  zh: 现在我们已经掌握了统计和机器学习在全球数据驱动企业架构中如何定位以及如何应用的知识，让我们专注于Spark和MLlib的具体实现。MLlib是Spark之上的一个机器学习库。Spark是大数据生态系统中的相对较新成员，它优化了内存使用而不是磁盘。数据在必要时仍然可以溢出到磁盘，但Spark只有在被明确指令或活动数据集不适合内存时才会进行溢出。Spark存储
    lineage 信息，以便在节点故障或由于其他原因信息从内存中删除时重新计算活动数据集。这与传统的MapReduce方法形成对比，在每次map或reduce任务之后，数据都会持久化到磁盘。

    with pre-defined names can contain parameters that will change the Spark behavior,

    possible in this and the following chapters. If you are working with **Hadoop
    Distributed File System** (**HDFS**), then the `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`
    files will contain the pointer and specifications for the HDFS master. The requirement
    for picking this file is that it has to be on `CLASSPATH` Java process, which,
    again, may be set by either specifying `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` or `SPARK_CLASSPATH`
    environment variables. As is usual with open source, you need to grep the code

- en: 'HDFS, Cassandra, S3, and Tachyon are the different ways to get the data into
    persistent storage and compute nodes as necessary with different guarantees. HDFS
    is a distributed storage implemented as a part of Hadoop, which serves as the
    backend for many products in the Hadoop ecosystem. HDFS divides each file into
    blocks, which are 128 MB in size by default, and stores each block on at least
    three nodes. Although HDFS is reliable and supports HA, a general complaint about
    HDFS storage is that it is slow, particularly for machine learning purposes. Cassandra
    is a general-purpose key/value storage that also stores multiple copies of a row
    and can be configured to support different levels of consistency to optimize read
    or write speeds. The advantage that Cassandra over HDFS model is that it does
    not have a central master node; the reads and writes are completed based on the
    consensus algorithm. This, however, may sometimes reflect on the Cassandra stability.
    S3 is the Amazon storage: The data is stored off-cluster, which affects the I/O
    speed. Finally, the recently developed Tachyon claims to utilize node''s memory
    to optimize access to working sets across the nodes.'

    HDFS 存储的一般抱怨是它速度较慢，尤其是在机器学习方面。Cassandra 是一种通用键/值存储，也存储行的多个副本，并可以配置为支持不同级别的数据一致性以优化读写速度。Cassandra
    相比于 HDFS 模型的优势在于它没有中央主节点；读取和写入是基于共识算法完成的。然而，这有时可能会反映在 Cassandra 的稳定性上。S3 是亚马逊存储：数据存储在集群之外，这影响了
    I/O 速度。最后，最近开发的 Tachyon 声称利用节点的内存来优化节点间工作集的访问。

- en: Most modern machine learning algorithms require multiple passes over data. If
    the data fits in the memory of a single machine, the data is readily available
    and this does not present a performance bottleneck. However, if the data becomes
    too large to fit into RAM, one has a choice of either dumping pieces of the data
    on disk (or database), which is about 100 times slower, but has a much larger
    capacity, or splitting the dataset between multiple machines across the network
    and transferring the results. While there are still ongoing debates, for most
    practical systems, analysis shows that storing the data over a set of network
    connected nodes has a slight advantage over repeatedly storing and reading it
    from hard disks on a single node, particularly if we can split the workload effectively
    between multiple CPUs.

- en: An average disk has bandwidth of about 100 MB/sec and transfers with a few mms
    latency, depending on the rotation speed and caching. This is about 100 times
    slower than reading the data from memory, depending on the data size and caching
    implementation again. Modern data bus can transfer data at over 10 GB/sec. While
    the network speed still lags behind the direct memory access, particularly with
    standard TCP/IP kernel networking layer overhead, specialized hardware can reach
    tens of GB/sec and if run in parallel, it can be potentially as fast as reading
    from the memory. In practice, the network-transfer speeds are somewhere between
    1 to 10 GB/sec, but still faster than the disk in most practical systems. Thus,
    we can potentially fit the data into combined memory of all the cluster nodes
    and perform iterative machine learning algorithms across a system of them.

    the help of the original Dean/Ghemawat paper (Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, *MapReduce:
    Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters*, OSDI, 2004.), is using exactly
    the disk layer persistence to guarantee fault tolerance and store intermediate
    results. A Hadoop MapReduce program would first run a `map` function on each row
    of a dataset, emitting one or more key/value pairs. These key/value pairs then
    would be sorted, grouped, and aggregated by key so that the records with the same
    key would end up being processed together on the same reducer, which might be
    running on same or another node. The reducer applies a `reduce` function that
    traverses all the values that were emitted for the same key and aggregates them
    accordingly. The persistence of intermediate results would guarantee that if a
    reducer fails for one or another reason, the partial computations can be discarded
    and the reduce computation can be restarted from the checkpoint-saved results.

    Data"), *Working with Unstructured Data*, but Spark uses Kryo serialization by
    default, which requires the classes to be registered explicitly in a static method.
    If you see a serialization error in your code, it is likely because the corresponding
    class has not been registered or Kryo does not support it, as it happens with
    too nested and complex data types. In general, it is recommended to avoid complex
    objects to be passed between the executors unless the object serialization can

    a metadata database. The merge is required, as it is more practical to write modifications
    of fsimage to a separate file instead of applying each modification to the disk
    image of the fsimage directly (in addition to applying the corresponding changes
    in memory). Secondary **Namenode** cannot serve as a second copy of the **Namenode**.
    A **Balancer** is run to move the blocks to maintain approximately equal disk
    usage across the servers—the initial block assignment to the nodes is supposed
    to be random, if enough space is available and the client is not run within the
    cluster. Finally, the **Client** communicates with the **Namenode** to get the
    metadata and block locations, but after that, either reads or writes the data
    directly to the node, where a copy of the block resides. The client is the only

    historically different approaches. Supervised learning is traditionally used when
    we have a specific goal to predict a label, or a specific attribute of a dataset.
    Unsupervised learning can be used to understand internal structure and dependencies
    between any attributes of a dataset, and is often used to group the records or
    attributes in meaningful clusters. In practice, both methods can be used to complement
    and aid each other.

    attributes. While a lot of datasets in the real world contain discrete or categorical
    attributes, internally they are always converted to a numerical representation
    for efficiency reasons, even if the L1 or L2 metrics on the resulting numerical
    attribute does not make much sense in the unordered discrete values. Second, the
    LIBSVM format allows for efficient sparse data representation. While the Iris
    dataset is not sparse, almost all of the modern big data sources are sparse, and
    the format allows for efficient storage by only storing the provided values. Many
    modern big data key-value and traditional RDBMS databases actually do the same
    for efficiency reasons.

    models can be combined to produce better classifiers. Usually, these methods work
    really well with decision trees as the training technique can be modified to produce
    models with large variations. One way is to train the model on random subsets
    of the original data or random subsets of attributes, which is called random forest.
    Another way is to generate a sequence of models, where misclassified instances
    are reweighted to get a larger weight in each subsequent iteration. It has been
    shown that this method has a relation to gradient descent methods in the model
    parameter space. While these are valid and interesting techniques, they usually
    require much more space in terms of model storage and are less interpretable compared
    to bare decision tree models. For Spark, the ensemble models are currently under
    development—the umbrella issue is SPARK-3703 ([https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3703)).

    could recover the original grouping, maybe without the exact label names—*setosa*,
    *versicolor*, and *virginica*. Unsupervised learning has multiple applications
    in compression and encoding, CRM, recommendation engines, and security to uncover
    internal structure without actually having the exact labels. The labels sometimes
    can be given base on the singularity in attribute value distributions. For example,
    *Iris setosa* can be described as a *Flower with Small Leaves*.

    the label, the reverse is also true. A clustering algorithm can be cast as a density-estimation
    problem by assigning label *1* to all vectors and generating random vectors with
    label *0* (*The Elements of Statistical Learning* by *Trevor Hastie*, *Robert
    Tibshirani*, *Jerome Friedman*, *Springer Series in Statistics*). The difference
    between the two is formal and it's even fuzzier with non-structured and nested
    data. Often, running unsupervised algorithms in labeled datasets leads to a better
    understanding of the dependencies and thus a better selection and performance
    of the supervised algorithm.

    better for some distributions and with *L1* target distance metric (absolute value
    of the difference) as opposed to *L2* (the sum of squares). K-medians centers
    are not necessarily present as a specific point in the dataset. K-medoids is another
    algorithm from the same family, where the resulting cluster center has to be an
    actual instance in the input set and we actually do not need to have the global
    sort, only the pairwise distances between the points. Many variations of the techniques
    exist on how to choose the original seed cluster centers and converge on the optimal
    number of clusters (besides the simple log trick I have shown).

    of hierarchical clustering is that it can be made deterministic and relatively
    fast, even though the cost of one iteration in k-means is probably going to be
    better. However, as mentioned, the unsupervised problem can actually be converted

    to usually predict the label for a given combination of attribute values. This
    is mostly due to the fact that the total number of possible distinct combinations
    of attributes increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the attribute
    space—at least in the case of discrete variables (in case of continuous variables,
    the situation is more complex and depends on the metrics used), and it is becoming

    of the input space. For example, if the label depends only on the linear combination

    for this linear combination like in logistic regression though.

    the hereditability of certain characteristics, such as weight and size, from one
    generation to another, with the hint of planned gene selection, including humans
    ([http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v9n3/stanton.html](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v9n3/stanton.html)).
    More specifically, in 1875, Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin and an accomplished
    19th-century scientist in his own right, which was also widely criticized for
    the promotion of eugenics, had distributed packets of sweet pea seeds to seven
    friends. Each friend received seeds of uniform weight, but with substantial variation
    across the seven packets. Galton''s friends were supposed to harvest the next
    generation seeds and ship them back to him. Galton then proceeded to analyze the
    statistical properties of the seeds within each group, and one of the analysis
    was to plot the regression line, which always appeared to have the slope less
    than one—the specific number cited was 0.33 (Galton, F. (1894), Natural Inheritance
    (5th ed.), New York: Macmillan and Company), as opposed to either *0*, in the
    case of no correlation and no inheritance; or *1*, in the case the total replication
    of the parent''s characteristics in the descendants. We will discuss why the coefficient
    of the regression line should always be less than *1* in the presence of noise
    in the data, even if the correlation is perfect. However, beyond the discussion
    and details, the origin of the term regression is partly due to planned breeding
    of plants and humans. Of course, Galton did not have access to PCA, Scala, or
    any other computing machinery at the time, which might shed more light on the
    differences between correlation and the slope of the regression line.'

- en: Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format, jointly developed by Cloudera and
    Twitter for big data. Columnar storage allows for better compression of values
    in the datasets and is more efficient if only a subset of columns need to be retrieved
    from the disk. Parquet was built from the ground up with complex nested data structures
    in mind and uses the record shredding and assembly algorithm described in the
    Dremel paper ([https://blog.twitter.com/2013/dremel-made-simple-with-parquet](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/dremel-made-simple-with-parquet)).
    Dremel/Parquet encoding uses definition/repetition fields to denote the level
    in the hierarchy the data is coming from, which covers most of the immediate encoding
    needs, as it is sufficient to store optional fields, nested arrays, and maps.
    Parquet stores the data by chunks, thus probably the name Parquet, which means
    flooring composed of wooden blocks arranged in a geometric pattern. Parquet can
    be optimized for reading only a subset of blocks from disk, depending on the subset
    of columns to be read and the index used (although it very much depends on whether
    the specific implementation is aware of these features). The values in the columns
    can use dictionary and **Run-Length Encoding** (**RLE**), which provides exceptionally
    good compression for columns with many duplicate entries, a frequent use case
    in big data.

    Objects are the cornerstone of object-oriented programming. A class is a template
    for objects with fields that represent the state, and methods that may represent
    the behavior. Abstract method implementation may depend on the instance of the
    class. In functional approach, the state is usually frowned upon; in pure programming
    languages, there should be no state, no side effects, and every invocation should
    return the same result. The behaviors may be expressed though additional function
    parameters and higher order functions (functions over functions, such as currying),
    but should be explicit unlike the abstract methods. Since Scala is a mix of object-oriented
    and functional language, some of the preceding constraints are violated, but this
    does not mean that you have to use them unless absolutely necessary. It is best
    practice to store the code in jar packages while storing the data, particularly
    for the big data, separate from code in data files (in a serialized form); but
    again, people often store data/configurations in jar files, and it is less common,
    but possible to store code in the data files.

    of common data structures they can handle.

    from the storage space perspective. For example, a Double represents a continuous
    number with 15-17 significant digits that will, without rounding or trivial ratios,
    take 15-17 bytes to represent in US ASCII, while the binary representation takes

- en: Sessionization seems just a simple rearranging of data—we just put the pages
    that were accessed in sequence together. Yet, in many cases, it makes practical
    data analysis run 10 to 100 times faster. The reason is data locality. The analysis,
    like filtering or path matching, most often tends to happen on the pages in one
    session at a time. Deriving user features requires all page views or interactions
    of the user to be in one place on disk and memory. This often beats other inefficiencies
    such as the overhead of encoding/decoding the nested structures as this can happen
    in local L1/L2 cache as opposed to data transfers from RAM or disk, which are
    much more expensive in modern multithreaded CPUs. This very much depends on the
    complexity of the analysis, of course.

    compact and more efficient to retrieve and show to my manager. Really, humans

    divided by the total number of attempts—the probability also can encode our beliefs.

- en: What is a graph? A graph is a set of **vertices** where some pairs of these
    vertices are linked with **edges**. If every vertex is linked with every other
    vertex, we say the graph is a complete graph. On the contrary, if it has no edges,
    the graph is said to be empty. These are, of course, extremes that are rarely
    encountered in practice, as graphs have varying degrees of density; the more edges
    it has proportional to the number of vertices, the more dense we say it is.
  id: totrans-890
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on what algorithms we intend to run on a graph and how dense is it
    expected to be, we can choose how to appropriately represent the graph in memory.
    If the graph is really dense, it pays off to store it as a square *N x N* matrix,
    where *0* in the *n*th row and *m*th column means that the *n* vertex is not connected
    to the *m* vertex. A diagonal entry expresses a node connection to itself. This
    representation is called the adjacency matrix.
  id: totrans-891

    distinction, often it pays off to store it as a simple container of pairs. This
    structure is called an **edge list**.
  id: totrans-892
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, we can model many real-life situations and events as graphs. We
    could imagine cities as vertices and plane routes as edges. If there is no flight
    between two cities, there is no edge between them. Moreover, if we add the numerical
    costs of plane tickets to the edges, we say that the graph is **weighted**. If
    there are some edges where only travels in one direction exist, we can represent
    that by making a graph directed as opposed to an undirected graph. So, for an
    undirected graph, it is true that the graph is symmetric, that is, if *A* is connected
    to *B*, then *B* is also connected to *A*—that is not necessarily true for a directed
    graph.

    builds management frameworks such as Ant, Maven, and Gradle exist in addition
    to IDEs? As the SBT authors argue, even though one might compile Scala using the
    preceding tools, all of them have inefficiencies, as it comes to interactivity

    These days are gone, and a personal laptop is probably having more computing power
    than rooms full of servers a few decades back. To take advantage of this efficiency,

    situations, R or Python present a more familiar and time-tested interface for
    statistical computations. In particular, R's extensive statistical library includes
    very popular ANOVA/MANOVA methods of analyzing variance and variable dependencies/independencies,
    sets of statistical tests, and random number generators that are not currently
    present in MLlib. The interface from R to Spark is available under SparkR project.
    Finally, data analysts know Python's NumPy and SciPy linear algebra implementations
    for their efficiency as well as other time-series, optimization, and signal processing
    packages. With R/Python integration, all these familiar functionalities can be
    exposed to Scala/Spark users until the Spark/MLlib interfaces stabilize and the
    libraries make their way into the new framework while benefiting the users with
    Spark's ability to execute workflows in a distributed way across multiple machines.

- en: As with many advanced and carefully designed technologies, people usually either
    love or hate R as a language. One of the reason being that R was one of the first
    language implementations that tries to manipulate complex objects, even though
    most of them turn out to be just a list as opposed to struct or map as in more
    mature modern implementations. R was originally created at the University of Auckland
    by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman around 1993, and had its roots in the S language
    developed at Bell Labs around 1976, when most of the commercial programming was
    still done in Fortran. While R incorporates some functional features such as passing
    functions as a parameter and map/apply, it conspicuously misses some others such
    as lazy evaluation and list comprehensions. With all this said, R has a very good
    help system, and if someone says that they never had to go back to the `help(…)`
    command to figure out how to run a certain data transformation or model better,
    they are either lying or just starting in R.

    ingest, whose goal is just to capture as much data as possible and perform data
    formatting/cleansing later on, the approach often referred as schema on read.

    of it. Big data techniques has started to penetrate NLP, even though traditionally,
    NLP is very computationally intensive and is regarded as a small data problem.
    NLP often requires extensive deep learning techniques, and the volume of data

    in human language can be subject to context, intonation, or even body language
    or facial expression. The value of such analysis, as opposed to the big data approach,

    known improvements we can make. First, a common technique is to stem the words.
    In many languages, words have a common part, often called root, and a changeable
    prefix or suffix, which may depend on the context, gender, time, and so on. Stemming
    is the process of improving the distinct count and intersection by approximating
    this flexible word form to the root, base, or a stem form in general. The stem
    form does not need to be identical to the morphological root of the word, it is
    usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem
    is not in itself a valid grammatical root. Secondly, we probably should account
    for the frequency of the words—while we will describe more elaborate methods in
    the next section, for the purpose of this exercise, we'll exclude the words with
    very high count, that usually are present in any document such as articles and
    possessive pronouns, which are usually called stop words, and the words with very
    low count. Specifically, I'll use the optimized **Porter Stemmer** implementation
    that I described in more detail at the end of the chapter.

    does a lot of serialization/deserialization when passing the objects. Potentially,
    I could use `map { val stemmer = new Stemmer; stemmer.stem(_) }` instead of `map
    { stemmer.stem(_) }`, but the latter reuses the object for multiple iterations
    and seems to be linguistically more appealing. One suggested performance optimization
    is to use *Kryo serializer*, which is less flexible than the Java serializer,
    but more performant. However, for integrative purpose, it is much easier to just
    make every object in the pipeline serializable and use default Java serialization.

- en: LDA in Spark MLlib is a clustering mechanism, where the feature vectors represent
    the counts of words in a document. The model maximizes the probability of observing
    the word counts, given the assumption that each document is a mixture of topics
    and the words in the documents are generated based on **Dirichlet distribution**
    (a generalization of beta distribution on multinomial case) for each of the topic
    independently. The goal is to derive the (latent) distribution of the topics and
    the parameters of the words generation statistical model.

    as if they were targeted for personal use when possible, which fully applies to
    monitoring, diagnostic, and debugging—quite hapless name for fixing existing issues
    in software products. Diagnostic and debugging of complex systems, particularly
    distributed systems, is hard, as the events often can be arbitrary interleaved
    and program executions subject to race conditions. While there is a lot of research
    going in the area of distributed system devops and maintainability, this chapter
    will scratch the service and provide guiding principle to design a maintainable
    complex distributed system.

    a lot of time avoiding side effects. While this idea is useful in a number of
    aspects, it is hard to imagine a useful program that has no effect on the outside
    world, the whole idea of a data-driven application is to have a positive effect
    on the way the business is conducted, a well-defined side effect.
  id: totrans-1408
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Monitoring clearly falls in the side effect category. Execution needs to leave
    a trace that the user can later parse in order to understand where the design
    or implementation went awry. The trace of the execution can be left by either
    writing something on a console or into a file, usually called a log, or returning
    an object that contains the trace of the program execution, and the intermediate
    results. The latter approach, which is actually more in line with functional programming
    and monadic philosophy, is actually more appropriate for the distributed programming
    but often overlooked. This would have been an interesting topic for research,
    but unfortunately the space is limited and I have to discuss the practical aspects
    of monitoring in contemporary systems that is almost always done by logging. Having
    the monadic approach of carrying an object with the execution trace on each call
    can certainly increase the overhead of the interprocess or inter-machine communication,
    but saves a lot of time in stitching different pieces of information together.

    Collecting logs over a set of nodes is not scalable (even though a few successful
    commercial systems exist that do this). Attaching a remote debugger is not always
    possible due to security and network restrictions. Remote debugging can also induce
    substantial overhead and interfere with the program execution, particularly for
    ones that use synchronization. Setting the debug level to the `DEBUG` or `TRACE`
    level helps sometimes, but leaves you at the mercy of the developer who may or
    may not have thought of a particular corner case you are dealing with right at
    the moment. The approach we take in this book is to open a servlet with enough

    project from scratch, there is a `gitter` command in `chapter10/bin/create_project.sh`.
    Gitter will create a `project/build.scala` file with a Scala object, extending
    build that will set project parameters and enable the Jetty plugin for the SBT.

    option and there are multiple systems to collect, search, and analyze logs from
    a set of distributed servers, it is often also important to have a simple way
    to introspect the running code. One way to accomplish this is to create a separate
    template with metrics, however, Scalatra provides metrics and health support to
    enable basic implementations for counts, histograms, rates, and so on.

    and `org.scalatra.metrics.HealthChecksSupport` traits provide templating similar
    to the Scalate templates, as shown in the following code.

- en: JSR 110 is another **Java Specification Request** (**JSR**), commonly known
    as **Java Management Extensions** (**JMX**). JSR 110 specifies a number of APIs
    and protocols in order to be able to monitor the JVM executions remotely. A common
    way to access JMX Services is via the `jconsole` command that will connect to
    one of the local processes by default. To connect to a remote host, you need to
    provide the `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=portNum` property on the Java
    command line. It is also advisable to enable security (SSL or password-based authentication).
    In practice, other monitoring tools use JMX for monitoring, as well as managing
    the JVM, as JMX allows callbacks to manage the system state.

    in JVM, the implementation of JMX (via MBeans) is very Java-specific, and it is

    be exposed as a servlet in Scala though.

    to concept drift, where the definition of the attributes change, or the changes
    in the underlying dependencies. Unfortunately, model performance rarely improves,
    at least in my practice. Thus, it is imperative to keep track of models. One way
    to do this is by monitoring the metrics that the model is intended to optimize,
    as in many cases, we do not have a ready-labeled set of data.'

    the quality of the statistical modeling, even though simpler models such as linear
    and logistic regression tend to be more stable than more complex models such as
    decision trees. Schema evolution or unnoticed renaming of attributes may cause
    the model to not perform well.

    come up with a set of criteria to retire a model. As real-world traffic rarely
    comes with the scored data, for example, the data that is already scored, the
    usual way to measure model performance is via a proxy, which is the metric that
    the model is supposed to improve.

    A/B testing is usually applied to versions of a web page where we direct completely

    test is usually the response rate. Unless any specific information is available
    about users, and in many cases, it is not unless a cookie is placed in the computer,
    the split is random. Often the split is based on unique userID, but this is known
    not to work too well across multiple devices. A/B testing is subject to the same
    assumptions the controlled experiments are subject to: the tests should be completely
    independent and the distribution of the dependent variable should be `i.i.d.`.

    performance metric for each of the channels together with estimated variance.
    Usually, one of the models is treated as a baseline and is associated with the
    null hypothesis, and for the rest of the models, we run a t-test, comparing the
    ratio of the difference to the standard deviation.

    to create application-specific metrics and health checks. We talked about a new
    emerging field of model monitoring in an ML application, where statistical models
    are subject to deterioration, health, and performance monitoring. I also touched
    on monitoring distributed systems, a topic that really deserves much more space,

    I've been able to achieve results in hours instead of days, which is the case
    with more traditional tools, but it is yet to win the popular support, which I
    am pretty sure it. We just need to emphasize its advantages in the modern world
    of interactive analysis, complex data, and distributed processing.
