			<p>Jeffrey Jackovich, is the author of this book, and a curious data scientist with a background in health-tech and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). He has extensive business-oriented healthcare knowledge, but enjoys analyzing all types of data with R and Python. He loves the challenges involved in the data science process, and his ingenious demeanor was tempered while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco. He is completing a Masters of Science in Computer Information Systems, with a Data Analytics concentration, from Boston University.</p>
			<p>Ruze Richards, is the author of this book, and a data scientist and cloud architect who has spent most of his career building high-performance analytics systems for enterprises and startups. He is especially passionate about AI and machine learning, having started life as a physicist who got excited about neural nets, then going on to work at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in order to further pursue this area of interest. With the new wave of excitement along with the actual computing power being available on the cloud for anybody to actually get amazing results with machine learning, he is thrilled to be able to spread the knowledge and help people achieve their goals.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Installation and Setup</h3>
			<p>Before you start this book, you will need an AWS account. You will also need to set up the AWS command-line interface (AWXSCLI), the steps for which can be found below. You will also need Python 3.6, pip and an AWS Rekognition Account throughout the book.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">AWS account</strong></p>
			<p>For an AWS free tier account, you will need a personal email address, and credit or debit card, and a cell phone that can receive text message so you can verify your account. To create a new account, follow this link <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">AWSCLI Setup</strong></p>
			<p>Install AWS CLI setup from the link <a href="https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-and-Jupyter">https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLISetup.exe</a>. To download the AWS CLI setup file (*includes 32-bit and 64-bit MSI installers and will automatically install the correct version). To verify install was successful open a command prompt and type <strong class="inline">aws --version</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Installing Python</strong></p>
			<p>Install Python 3.6 following the instructions at: <a href="https://realpython.com/installing-python">https://realpython.com/installing-python/</a>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Installing pip</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To install pip, go to command prompt and type <strong class="inline">pip install awscli </strong><strong class="inline">--upgrade --user</strong>. Verify the successful install with command "<strong class="inline">aws - -version</strong>"</li>
				<li>After installing <strong class="inline">pip</strong>, add the AWS executable to your OS's PATH environment variable. With an MSI installation, this should occur automatically, but you may need to set it manually if the "<strong class="inline">aws - -version</strong>" command is not working.</li>
				<li>To modify your <strong class="inline">PATH</strong> variable (Windows), type <strong class="inline">environment variables</strong>, and select <strong class="inline">Edit the system environment variables for your account</strong>, select the path, and add the path to the variable value field, separated by semicolons.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Installing Virtual Environment</strong></p>
			<p>Install the Anaconda version depending on your operating system from the following link <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a>. Anaconda helps install what you need without conflicting packages.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To check the Anaconda Distribution is up to date, type <strong class="inline">conda update conda</strong>.</li>
				<li>To create a virtual environment, type<strong class="inline"> conda create -n yourenvname python=3.6 anaconda</strong> and press <strong class="inline">y</strong> to continue, this will install the Python version and all associated anaconda packaged libraries at <strong class="inline">path_to_you_anaconda_location/anaconda/envs/yourenvname</strong>.</li>
				<li>To activate the account on macOS and Linux, type <strong class="inline">source activate yourenvname</strong> and for Windows type <strong class="inline">activate yourenvname</strong>.</li>
				<li>To install the additional Python packages to a virtual environment, type <strong class="inline">conda install –n yourenvname [package]</strong>.</li>
				<li>To deactivate the virtual environment type <strong class="inline">deactivate</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Configuration and Credential files</strong></p>
			<p>To locate the config file, see the operating specific commands below. For more information see: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html</a>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon Rekognition Account</strong></p>
			<p>You will need to create a new Amazon Rekognition free tier account where customers can analyze up to 5,000 images free each month for the first 12 months. To create the free account, follow the link <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/</a></p>
