			<p class="author-quote">"Whatever you are studying right now, if you are not getting up to speed on deep learning, neural networks, etc., you lose. We are going through the process where software will automate software, automation will automate automation."</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Mark Cuban <a id="_idTextAnchor092"/></p>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you were introduced to the Azure <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) landscape and how to do automated ML in the Azure platform. In this chapter, you will learn how to get started with ML using <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), along with different offerings and a detailed understanding of the ginormous AWS cloud stack. </p>
			<p>The theme of this chapter is to get started with an introduction to AWS ML capabilities to give a wider perspective of this large ecosystem; not only AWS as a hyperscaler but also the breadth of the field itself. Many use cases and permutations require specialized solutions and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for an enterprise's AI and ML needs. That is why this breadth of knowledge about every cloud offering is important as you embark on your automated ML journey. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Overview of ML in the AWS landscape</li>
				<li>Getting started with AWS ML</li>
				<li>Working with AWS SageMaker Autopilot</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>ML in the AWS landscape</h1>
			<p>Gartner is among a few <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>major advisory companies that<a id="_idIndexMarker299"/> regularly review the landscape of technology and provide a comprehensive overview of their findings in their Magic Quadrant reports. In its latest release, the Magic Quadrant contains Anaconda and Altair as niche players, Microsoft, DataRobot, KNIME, Google, H2O.ai, RapidMiner, and Domino as visionaries, IBM as a challenger, and Alteryx, SAS, Databricks, MathWorks, TIBCO, and Dataiku as leaders in the data science and ML space. </p>
			<p>It is surprising for us to not see AWS mentioned here. There are six companies in the leadership quadrant <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>due to their consistent record of data science and AI solution deliveries, and seven are classified as visionaries. However, AWS not making it to the visionaries and/or the leaders quadrant is attributed to the announcement delay. The AWS flagship AI<a id="_idIndexMarker301"/> products SageMaker Studio and SageMaker Autopilot were announced after the deadline for Gartner submission; hence they didn't make the cut. It is surprising not to see AWS on the list because of the breadth of the AWS solution landscape. As a cloud services provider with a headstart, AWS dominates the market share greater than the sum of its closest three competitors. </p>
			<p>AWS provides a comprehensive set of tools to developers, data scientists, ML engineers, and enthusiasts to work with AI and ML. These tools range from frameworks <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>and infrastructure components, ML services, AI services, <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDEs</strong>), and APIs to training and tutorials to get you started in the ever-growing world of AWS offerings. The following is a bird's-eye view of the AWS ML stack:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Amazon ML stack – set of AI and ML services and capabilities – courtesy of Amazon re:Invent</p>
			<p>Due to both the <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>depth and breadth of these myriad offerings, each of these services deserves at least a chapter of its own, but then we would not be able to meet those slippery deadlines. Therefore, in the interest of time and brevity, we <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>will only focus on the automated ML part, that is, Amazon SageMaker and its Autopilot offering. Please see the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section for links to read more about Amazon's ML stack. </p>
			<p>SageMaker is a fully managed, cloud-based ML platform that provides AI operationalization capabilities by enabling an end-to-end ML workflow, without the metaphorical tears. In the following figure, you will see the components for end-to-end ML with AWS that are used to prepare, build, train, tune, deploy, and manage models. You <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>will also notice how SageMaker Autopilot offers capabilities across the<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> spectrum to automatically build and train models, as well as to prepare, build, and maintain these<a id="_idIndexMarker307"/> models throughout the life cycle:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer176" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – End-to-end ML with AWS</p>
			<p>Even though our focus is on automated ML capabilities, it is worthwhile for you to explore the Amazon SageMaker landscape. One of the key offerings is Amazon SageMaker Studio, a web-based ML IDE to prepare, build, deploy, and operationalize models. When SageMaker is mentioned, this IDE is what most people think of, but you will see that it is part of a larger ecosystem. </p>
			<p>Notebooks are the Swiss Army knives of data scientists. Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks provide the comforting environment that data scientists have come to know and love, for the<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> most part. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth provides training datasets, while Amazon <strong class="bold">Augmented AI</strong> (<strong class="bold">A2I</strong>) enables <strong class="bold">Human-in-the-Loop</strong> (<strong class="bold">HITL</strong>), where a<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> carbon-based lifeform is required to review the ML predictions, especially ones with low confidence scores. Amazon SageMaker Experiments is similar to what you have explored earlier, in the other hyperscaler offerings. It helps to track data, enables reconstruction and sharing of an <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>experiment, and provides tracing information for <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>auditing purposes. Amazon SageMaker comes with a wide variety of built-in algorithms for <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>classification, regression, text analysis, topic modeling, forecasting, clustering, and many more use cases, as seen in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.3_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms</p>
			<p>Amazon SageMaker <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>Debugger helps inspect parameters and data, while Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor keeps an eye on model behavior in production. Model monitoring has gained loads of attention recently since data drift can significantly impact model quality, and therefore predictions. Online learning can be perilous; let Tay serve as a lesson learned. Some of the features of Amazon SageMaker for the democratization of AI can be seen in the following figure:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Different types of Amazon SageMaker capabilities – courtesy of Amazon re:Invent</p>
			<p>Amazon SageMaker also <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>offers reinforcement learning, batch transformation, and elastic inference capabilities. Amazon SageMaker Neo <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>enables the <em class="italic">train once, run anywhere </em>capability<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> and helps separate training and inference infrastructure. Neo is powered by the Apache-licensed Neo-AI-DLR common runtime, supports the usual suspects (TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, ONNX, and XGBoost), and even claims to speed them up. Lastly, we have Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, our focus for this book, where citizen data scientists can build, train, and test ML models – bringing us one step closer to the democratization of AI.</p>
			<p>We will discuss more on<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> SageMaker Autopilot in the second<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> half of this chapter. First, let's explore writing some code in AWS SageMaker. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Getting started with AWS ML</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will do a<a id="_idIndexMarker319"/> walkthrough of the AWS Management Console and show you how to use AWS SageMaker with step-by-step instructions. Let's dive in. The AWS ML environment is fairly intuitive and easy to work with: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>To start, first open up the AWS Management Console by visiting <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">aws.amazon.com</a> in your browser. Now, click on <strong class="bold">Sign in to the Console</strong>, or log back in (if you are a returning user):<div id="_idContainer179" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.5_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – AWS Management Console&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – AWS Management Console</p></li>
				<li>Enter your root (account) user's email address in the <strong class="bold">Root user email address</strong> field to proceed:<div id="_idContainer180" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.6_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – AWS Management Console login&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – AWS Management Console login</p></li>
				<li>Upon successful login, you<a id="_idIndexMarker320"/> will be taken to the following screen, the AWS Management Console:<div id="_idContainer181" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.7_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – AWS Management Console&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – AWS Management Console</p></li>
				<li>AWS has a collection <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>of tons of different services. In the AWS Management Console, find the services search box, then type <strong class="source-inline">sagemaker</strong> to find the <strong class="screen-inline">Amazon SageMaker</strong> service, as shown in the following screenshot, and click on it:<div id="_idContainer182" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.8_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – SageMaker search in the AWS Management Console&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – SageMaker search in the AWS Management Console</p></li>
				<li>This will take you to the SageMaker home page shown in the following screenshot. Here, you can read up on the different offerings, such as Ground Truth, notebooks, jobs processing, and so on:<div id="_idContainer183" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.9_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – Amazon SageMaker home page&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – Amazon SageMaker home page</p><p>The AWS team has put <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>a copious amount of work into building the documentation, training videos, and partner training programs to get developers up to speed. You can see some of these courses in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section at the end of the chapter. For example, here, when you click on the top link in the left-hand pane, it will show you information regarding how you can build, train, and deploy models using Amazon SageMaker Studio. Contextual documentation, pretty neat eh! </p><div id="_idContainer184" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.10_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – Amazon SageMaker Studio home page&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Amazon SageMaker Studio home page</p></li>
				<li>Now, let's explore SageMaker Studio, where we will be developing a classification model for <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>our favorite dataset. In the <strong class="bold">Get started</strong> section, you will create a username and define an execution <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) role. An IAM role gives you granular permissions as to what <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>you can and cannot do on the AWS platform. Click on the <strong class="bold">Execution role</strong> dropdown to select the role you intend to use (or create a new role):<div id="_idContainer185" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.11_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – Amazon SageMaker Studio Get started screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – Amazon SageMaker Studio Get started screen</p></li>
				<li>You can create <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>an IAM role if you don't have one already and grant the appropriate permissions, as shown in the following screenshot. S3 is one of the AWS storage mechanisms and the following screen allows you to create an IAM role to access S3 buckets. This is a one-time setup process, unless you plan to make changes:<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.12_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – Amazon SageMaker Studio IAM role creation screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Amazon SageMaker Studio IAM role creation screen</p></li>
				<li>Once you are done<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> creating the IAM role, you will see the following success message. Press <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> to navigate to the next screen:<div id="_idContainer187" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.13_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Amazon SageMaker Studio IAM role creation success &#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Amazon SageMaker Studio IAM role creation success </p></li>
				<li>Once the role is<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> created, you will be taken to the SageMaker dashboard, where you will see the available offerings, as shown in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer188" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.14_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14 – Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 – Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard</p></li>
				<li>From this earlier screen, you can now navigate to the <strong class="bold">Control Panel</strong> to see your associated user<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> and click on <strong class="bold">Open Studio</strong>, which will take you (finally) to SageMaker Studio:<div id="_idContainer189" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.15_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.15 – Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard</p><p>The following screenshot shows what SageMaker Studio looks like. It is similar to other online cloud ML IDEs you might have seen in previous, and also in future, chapters about hyperscalers. Here, you can create notebooks, build experiments, and deploy and monitor your ML services:</p><div id="_idContainer190" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.16_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16 – Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – Amazon SageMaker Studio dashboard</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create a notebook</strong> button and<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> you will see the following screen, which will open up the Jupyter Notebook:<div id="_idContainer191" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.17_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.17 – Amazon SageMaker Studio loading&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17 – Amazon SageMaker Studio loading</p></li>
				<li>Once you see the following launcher screen, you will be able to create notebooks. In our case, we will clone the AWS SageMaker <strong class="source-inline">examples</strong> repository on GitHub (<a href="https://GitHub.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples">https://GitHub.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples</a>):<div id="_idContainer192" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.18_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18 – Amazon SageMaker notebook activity launcher&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – Amazon SageMaker notebook activity launcher</p></li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Clone a Repository</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker330"/> provide the GitHub repository to download it locally, and you will see the following window pop up. Click on <strong class="bold">CLONE</strong> to clone the repo: <div id="_idContainer193" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.19_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.19 – Amazon SageMaker Clone a repo dialog&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19 – Amazon SageMaker Clone a repo dialog</p></li>
				<li>Once the repository is cloned, you will be able to see the following tree in AWS SageMaker:<div id="_idContainer194" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.20_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure. 6.20 – Amazon SageMaker cloned repository directory view&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure. 6.20 – Amazon SageMaker cloned repository directory view</p></li>
				<li>Navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">/aws_sagemaker_studio/getting_started/</strong> folder and open the <strong class="source-inline">xgboost_customer_churn_studio.ipynb</strong> notebook. Upon opening this<a id="_idIndexMarker331"/> notebook, you will need to choose a preferred Python kernel to run it. Select the <strong class="bold">Python 3 (Data Science)</strong> kernel:<div id="_idContainer195" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.21_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure. 6.21 – Amazon SageMaker repository – selecting the preferred kernel &#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure. 6.21 – Amazon SageMaker repository – selecting the preferred kernel </p></li>
				<li>Now that you have selected the kernel, you will notice that you still cannot run the notebook. Why? Well, you <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>need a compute resource! Now it's time to select the compute instance you would like to use. In our case, we went with the <strong class="source-inline">ml.t3.medium</strong> general-purpose instance (which costs $0.05 per hour at the time of writing) but you can choose bigger and better machines to make your experiments run faster. The pricing details are found here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/</a>. Click on <strong class="bold">Save and continue</strong> to proceed: <div id="_idContainer196" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.22_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure. 6.22 – Amazon SageMaker repository – select the preferred compute instance&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure. 6.22 – Amazon SageMaker repository – select the preferred compute instance</p></li>
				<li>There might be cases where you need to change the type of compute instance. In that case, you would need to delete the previous instances since your account may not allow <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>multiple instances to run simultaneously. You can see the link for deleting an app in the following screenshot:  <div id="_idContainer197" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_6.23_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure. 6.23 – Amazon SageMaker repository – select the preferred compute instance &#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure. 6.23 – Amazon SageMaker repository – select the preferred compute instance </p></li>
				<li>The compute resource and kernel are identified; now you are all set and ready to run this notebook using the control toolbar shown in the following screenshot and install Python, and other related SDK. This introductory Amazon SageMaker Studio walkthrough is an excellent place to start since it walks you through some of the key features of SageMaker Studio. The key use case here is <strong class="bold">Using Gradient Boosted Trees to Predict Mobile Customer Departure</strong>, which includes preparation of the dataset and uploading it to Amazon S3, training with the Amazon SageMaker XGBoost algorithm, building an S3 experiment, debugging, hosting, and monitoring. We will leave the walkthrough as homework for you:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24 – Amazon SageMaker Studio walkthrough notebook</p>
			<p>In this section, you have <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>learned how to get started with AWS SageMaker and did a quick walkthrough. This is not meant to be an exhaustive summary of the SageMaker features, which is what the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide offers. You can download it from here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-dg.pdf">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-dg.pdf</a>.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will look into the automated ML features of AWS SageMaker.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>AWS SageMaker Autopilot</h1>
			<p>SageMaker Autopilot, as the<a id="_idIndexMarker335"/> name suggests, is a <em class="italic">fully managed system that provides an automatic ML solution</em>. The goal, as in any automated ML solution, is to try to offload most of the redundant and time-consuming, repetitive work to the machine while humans can do higher-level cognitive tasks. In the following diagram, you can see the parts of the ML life cycle that SageMaker <a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Autopilot covers:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer199" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.25_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.25 – Lifecycle of Amazon SageMaker&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.25 – Lifecycle of Amazon SageMaker</p>
			<p>As part of the SageMaker ecosystem, SageMaker Autopilot is tasked with being the automated ML engine. A typical automated ML user flow is defined in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> figure, where a user analyzes the tabular data, selects the target prediction column, and then lets Autopilot do its magic of finding the correct algorithm. The secret sauce here is the underlying Bayesian optimizer as defined by <em class="italic">Das et al.</em> in their paper <em class="italic">Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: a white box AutoML solution at scale</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.science/publications/amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-a-white-box-automl-solution-at-scale">https://www.amazon.science/publications/amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-a-white-box-automl-solution-at-scale</a>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer200" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.26_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.26 – Amazon SageMaker Autopilot life cycle &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.26 – Amazon SageMaker Autopilot life cycle </p>
			<p>Once the automatic<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> model creation phase completes, it provides full visibility for the model notebooks. The workflow in the following figure shows the job processing of a ML pipeline. Providing a structured dataset and the target column, AWS SageMaker Autopilot splits the data for training and validation folds, transforms the data with pipeline execution, reviews the list of models, and ranks them by the quality metric: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer201" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.27_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.22 – Amazon SageMaker Autopilot – under the hood&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.22 – Amazon SageMaker Autopilot – under the hood</p>
			<p>The Bayesian optimizer and multiple trials based on the candidate notebook are at the root of this hyperparameter optimization. The following under-the-hood diagram shows how one candidate<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> notebook spawns multiple trials, and even more model training and tuning instances. This process ends up generating a leaderboard of candidate models to be chosen and ranked on measures such as model accuracy, latency, and other trade-offs.</p>
			<p>A trade-off can be seen in the following figure. The accuracy difference between model #1 and #2 is 2%; however, the latency, that is, the time the model took to respond, is increased by 250 ms, which is quite significant:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer202" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_6.28_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 6.28 – Autopilot job accuracy versus latency trade-off – courtesy of Amazon re:Invent&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.28 – Autopilot job accuracy versus latency trade-off – courtesy of Amazon re:Invent</p>
			<p>SageMaker Autopilot publishes the final models, the training approach, that is, the pipeline showing the hyperparameters, the algorithm, and the associated measure. This demonstration helps to make these models transparent from an MLOps perspective and creates high-quality, editable<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> ML models that scale well. These models can be published and monitored within the SageMaker ecosystem for drift, and an alternative model can be chosen and deployed at will. These capabilities are at the forefront of the AWS ML ecosystem, enabling developers to build and deploy valuable solutions for customers. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>AWS JumpStart </h1>
			<p>In Dec 2020, Amazon announced SageMaker JumpStart as a capability to access pre-built model repositories also called model zoos to accelerate model development. Integrated as apart of Amazon SageMaker, JumpStart provides pre-built templates for predictive maintenance, computer vision, autonomous driving, fraud detection, credit risk prediction, OCR for extracting and analyze data from documents, churn prediction, and personalized recommendations.</p>
			<p>JumpStart provides an excellent starting point for developers to use these pre-existing templates to JumpStart (pun intended) their development. These accelerator and starter kits are available on GitHub here. <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/">https://github.com/awslabs/</a> and provide recipes and best practices to use Amazon SageMaker model development and deployment mechanisms.</p>
			<p>Further details on using AWS JumpStart can be found here. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html</a> </p>
