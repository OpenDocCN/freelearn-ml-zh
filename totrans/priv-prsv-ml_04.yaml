- en: We highlight the risks associated with reconstruction attacks in SQL, where
    an adversary attempts to reconstruct sensitive information from seemingly anonymized
    data. We discuss various prevention methods and countermeasures that can be employed
    to mitigate such attacks and protect individuals' privacy.
