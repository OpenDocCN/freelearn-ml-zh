<p>Predicting the future has always been a central concern and has captivated humankind for thousands of years, and it’s still a hot topic! Predicting the future helps to identify and exploit opportunities, optimize resource allocation, and prepare better for catastrophes, disasters, and crises. Predictive analytics is a subfield of data analysis that aims to utilize historical data to predict or forecast the future. Now, to embark on our journey of understanding predictive analytics, let’s examine some of its <span class="No-Break">interesting applications.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>Applications of predictive analytics</h2>
<p>There are enormous applications<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> of predictive analytics in practice. A sample of these applications is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 12</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

<p>Let’s briefly discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> some of <span class="No-Break">these applications.</span></p>
<h3>Sales and marketing</h3>
<p>Identifying potential customers<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> is paramount for companies, as it enables them to concentrate their resources and attention and allocate their advertising efforts effectively toward a specific customer segment. Additionally, it helps companies to create personalized advertisements, products, and services. Thus, they can attract more customers, optimize their resources, and consequently achieve higher profits. For example, <em class="italic">Starbucks</em> leverages your purchase<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> history to suggest new drinks that you may like. For more information, refer to <em class="italic">How Starbucks Uses Predictive Analytics and Your Loyalty Card </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Data</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://demand-planning.com/2018/05/29/how-starbucks-uses-predictive-analytics-and-your-loyalty-card-data"><span class="No-Break">https://demand-planning.com/2018/05/29/how-starbucks-uses-predictive-analytics-and-your-loyalty-card-data</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<p>Moreover, price optimization is another central element for businesses. Companies usually aim to find the ideal price that will achieve the highest profitability. There is often a trade-off between low prices but more customers and high prices but fewer customers. Thus, companies utilize predictive analytics and ML to take into consideration market situations, such as demand, competitors’ prices, and item qualities and quantities for optimal price<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> predictions. For more information about pricing<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> optimization, refer to <em class="italic">Pricing Optimization &amp; Machine Learning </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Techniques</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://vitalflux.com/pricing-optimization-machine-learning-techniques"><span class="No-Break">https://vitalflux.com/pricing-optimization-machine-learning-techniques</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<p>Predicting accurately the progression<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> of a disease helps to control its progression or even prevent it. For example, predicting the progression of cancer is crucial to plan the most effective treatment for patients. In general, chronic diseases especially benefit from utilizing predictive analytics. Researchers have shown that utilizing test results, clinical visits, and other information about the patient can help them to accurately predict chronic disease progression. For more details, read <em class="italic">Chronic Disease Progression Prediction: Leveraging Case-Based Reasoning and Big Data </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Analytics</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13532"><span class="No-Break">https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13532</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h3>Predictive maintenance</h3>
<p>Unplanned downtime<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> is one of the main issues that negatively impact customers, services, a company’s reputation, and revenue. Thus, predicting machinery failures can help to avoid them and enhance machine and equipment lifespan. Predictive analytics usually leverage data collected from various sources, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Data from sensors, such as pressure, temperature, and <span class="No-Break">vibration frequency</span></li>
<li>Data from failure recorders, such as the failure types, the reasons, and <span class="No-Break">the consequences</span></li>
<li>Machine historical performance data, such as data collected under standard and non-standard <span class="No-Break">operating conditions</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Industry benchmarks</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about predictive analytics<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> applications for equipment failure, refer to <em class="italic">Predictive Maintenance: Employing IIoT and Machine Learning to Prevent Equipment </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Failures</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/predictive-maintenance"><span class="No-Break">https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/predictive-maintenance</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h3>Risk management</h3>
<p>Predictive analytics is widely used for risk management<a id="_idIndexMarker519"/> in modern business. The historical data of previous risk incidents and fraudulent activities can be leveraged to train ML models to predict possible attacks, threats, and risks in the future. <em class="italic">PayPal</em>, <em class="italic">Apple Pay</em>, and <em class="italic">Amazon Pay</em> continuously assess customers’ behavior to identify any suspicious activities or abnormal patterns. This includes unusual spending patterns, many failed authentication attempts, and rapid account or customer information changes. The ML models are usually trained<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> on customers’ relevant data, such as transaction patterns, device information, and customers’ locations. For more information, refer to <em class="italic">4 Ways Machine Learning Helps You Detect Payment </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Fraud</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/payment-fraud-detection-machine-learning"><span class="No-Break">https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/payment-fraud-detection-machine-learning</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into the main issues of real data-based predictive analytics solutions <span class="No-Break">in practice.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Predictive analytics issues with real data</h1>
<p>In this section, you will learn about the main issues with real data-based predictive analytics solutions. Mainly, we will discuss the following <span class="No-Break">three issues.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Partial and scarce training data</h2>
<p>One of the main requirements <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>of predictive analytics models to work well in practice is the availability of large-scale historical data. In sectors such as healthcare, banking, security, and manufacturing, it is not easy to find such datasets. The main reasons behind that are privacy concerns, regulations, and trade secrets. As we know, without sufficient training datasets, ML algorithms simply cannot work well in practice. Thus, predictive analytics methods based on real data work well only in certain fields where data is available. Therefore, augmenting real data with synthetic data can complement small-sized and incomplete real datasets. Thus, it solves one of the main issues of real datasets in these fields, as we will see<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Bias</h2>
<p>Certainly, another major issue<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> with real datasets is bias. In other words, data is often not evenly distributed. Thus, predictive models become biased, which leads to wrong decisions and predictions. Using synthetic data, you can make your dataset balanced by generating samples for classes or categories with fewer samples. This positively impacts your predictive model performance and, thus, improves the decision-making procedure of <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Cost</h2>
<p>Although collecting and annotating real data<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> is often an expensive and time-consuming process, companies must update their data continuously to accurately capture and present the real market. Thus, using real data may cost the company more and yet cause ML models to make predictions based on outdated data. Additionally, as mentioned, companies need to continuously collect and annotate real data, which is indeed a cumbersome process. Synthetic data can be generated quickly and efficiently to augment real data. Thus, it presents a cheap and high-quality solution for predictive <span class="No-Break">analytics problems.</span></p>
<p>Now, let’s explore in detail three case studies of utilizing synthetic data in <span class="No-Break">predictive analytics.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Case studies of utilizing synthetic data for predictive analytics</h1>
<p>In this section, you will explore the huge<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> opportunities brought by synthetic data to the field of predictive analytics. You will delve into three interesting <span class="No-Break">case studies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Provinzial and <span class="No-Break">synthetic data</span></li>
<li>Healthcare benefits from synthetic data in <span class="No-Break">predictive analytics</span></li>
<li>Amazon fraud transaction prediction using <span class="No-Break">synthetic data</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Provinzial and synthetic data</h2>
<p>Provinzial, one of the top insurance<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> companies in Germany, always had many issues<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> with the usability of real insurance data because of the many regulations<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> that limit the usability of sensitive data for predictive analytics in a rapidly changing market, such as the insurance market. At the same time, they wanted to improve their services and the offers they make to their customers. To address these issues, they investigated using synthetic data and, indeed, trained their ML models using the generated synthetic data. The predictive analytics<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> synthetic data-based system, called “Next Best Offer,” achieved amazing results, which helped the company to better understand and support customers. Leveraging synthetic data, they were able to train their model on a large-scale dataset of 1 million customers, including 380 features. The dataset included sensitive information about customers such as addresses, payment histories, and insurance claims. They emphasized that using synthetic data helped their company to test their hypothesis without violating customers’ privacy. Synthetic data reduced the time required to handle privacy issues. They concluded that using synthetic data-based predictive analytics was beneficial <span class="No-Break">and valuable:</span></p>
<p class="author-quote">“We have found it [a synthetic data-based solution] to be a useful solution for our data science team to simplify data access and focus on our data projects, machine learning model optimizations, and testing new ideas.”</p>

<p>For more<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> information, refer to <em class="italic">Synthetic data for predictive analytics in insurance: The case of </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Provinzial</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://www.statice.ai/post/synthetic-data-for-predictive-analytics"><span class="No-Break">https://www.statice.ai/post/synthetic-data-for-predictive-analytics</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Healthcare benefits from synthetic data in predictive analytics</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Chimeric Antigen Receptors Cell Therapy</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAR-T</strong>) is an effective treatment for specific types<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> of blood cancer. Usually, the decision<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> of which patients are eligible and can better<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> benefit from this treatment is decided by a dedicated panel (see <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/cdf/car-t-therapy">https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/cdf/car-t-therapy</a>). ML models and predictive analytics are utilized to make accurate predictions for this task. However, with the limited amount of available real data, the task is complex for ML models. As expected, a slight improvement in the accuracy of such models means more lives to save and less cost to spend. Thus, it is still a hot research topic that requires <span class="No-Break">more work.</span></p>
<p>In this particular case study, the task is a binary classification problem – eligible or ineligible to receive CAR-T treatment. The main issue here, in addition to data scarcity, is an imbalanced data distribution, where one class has much more training samples compared to the other, which causes the ML models to give biased predictions. Using synthetic data to augment real data was an ideal solution to make the training dataset balanced. This is achieved by generating synthetic samples for the class with less <span class="No-Break">training data.</span></p>
<p>Utilizing synthetic data for this problem<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> improved the performance by at least three percentage points, and an estimated £6.5 million was saved. Additionally, the solution did not breach any regulations or violate any patients’ privacy. Above all of these outcomes, more appropriate patients<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> were identified and, thus, more lives were saved!

<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Amazon fraud transaction prediction using synthetic data</h2>
<p>According to <em class="italic">UK Finance’s Annual Fraud Report of 2023</em>, in the UK, an estimated<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> £1.2 billion was lost because of various<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> fraudulent activities (<a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/annual-fraud-report-2023">https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/annual-fraud-report-2023</a>). Unfortunately, this is not the only problem; fraudulent<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> activities also hinder economic growth, disrupt relationships, and weaken <span class="No-Break">social cohesion.</span></p>
<p><em class="italic">Amazon</em> had many issues with the available real datasets that can be leveraged for predictive analytics specifically for fraud transactions. In addition to bias and imbalance issues with real datasets, they did not include sufficient training samples under rare events. This caused ML models<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> to be less accurate in these scenarios. To address these issues, they utilized <strong class="bold">WGAN-GP</strong>, which we discussed in <a href="B18494_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>. They leveraged WGAN-GP to learn real data. Then, they used this generative model to generate samples to make the dataset balanced and include rare fraudulent activities. This supplemented the training dataset and directly improved the robustness and generalizability of the ML model under standard<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> and challenging scenarios, where no sufficient real training data was available.
