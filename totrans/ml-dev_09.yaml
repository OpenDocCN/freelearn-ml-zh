- en: Linux is, in our view, the most flexible platform on which you can work for machine
    learning projects. As you probably know, there is a really large number of alternatives
    in the Linux realm, and they all have their own particular package management.

    take a large number of pages, we will settle on instructions for the **Ubuntu
    16.04** distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ubuntu is undoubtedly the most widespread Linux distribution, and in the particular
    case of Ubuntu 16.04 it is an LTS version, or long term support. This means that
    the base software we will run in this book will have support until the year 2021.

    even if it is considered by many to be newbie-oriented, it has the necessary support
    for all the technologies that a current machine learning environment requires,
    and has a very large user base.

    Anaconda. It contains a complete high performance Python, Scala, and R ecosystem,
    including the most well-known packages used in data science. It also includes
    a host of other packages available through `conda`, which is the main utility
    of the package and manages the environment, packages, and dependencies.
