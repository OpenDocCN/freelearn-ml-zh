- en: VMware Global Services have built an intelligent support engine called Skyline,
    which collects customer-specific VMware products related data without any manual
    effort or compromise of security policies. It aggregates and analyzes this data
    to help the support team attain a quick time-to-resolution and take action to
    prevent upcoming issues.

- en: We can get a full 360-degree view of VMware products in the customer's environment,
    from a deployment and usage perspective. We can help customers by providing them
    with more information and allowing them to interact with all customer endpoints
    for an overview of known and unknown issues. Skyline is necessary for mission-critical
    applications running on a VMware infrastructure, which is available 24/7, 365
    days a year, and is highly optimized to achieve maximum performance from its resources.
    Customers want quick resolutions and suggestions, with all the supporting data
    analytics to recognize problems before they create issues in the customer environment.
    Skyline can take care of all of these requirements with its smart support system,
    which helps support engineers learn information and data about the specific customer's
    deployment of VMware products.

    to suggest proactive, prescriptive, and predictive recommendations about a problem
    that might occur in the future, in advance. It would also help support teams with
    their reactive support cases, since these could be resolved more quickly to help
    customers get back to their businesses faster. VMware Skyline consists of three
    technology  (Collector, rule engine and Advisor) components. Global Services has
    innovative new support capabilities.

    will be delivered as an SaaS application for customers. This will provide detailed
    analysis about the outcomes of identified alerts and suggested operations, so
    that customers can configure smart remediation. An advisor can be utilized and
    connected with a viewer to fully utilize this policy-based analysis engine, which
    is comprised of support intelligence libraries, product information, and logic
    to analyze the internal customer-specific product deployment data. This is used
    to get suggestions and detailed reports that can be shared with customers. It
    is well integrated with VMware validated design, best practices, and **Knowledge
    Base** (**KB**) articles, to send alerts, identify faults and issues, and any
    deviations from recommended design. It then initiates a remediation process with
    support assistance by support engineers, or faults and issues can be solved through
    self-service steps. Skyline has a single collector instance to collect and transfer
    VMware product-related information back to the **VMware Analytics Cloud** (**VAC**)
    infrastructure. Customers who have active product support can use Skyline Collector. It
    can analyze changes, activities, and patterns related to specific information
    such as faults by using a machine learning engine. The Skyline policy engine supports
    intelligence libraries, and product information and the relevant logic is saved
    to analyze the customer's internal flow of data that's relevant to VMware products.
    It send notices if the customer is not following VMware validated design practices
    to make configurations or patch management for VMware products. All of the problems
    that are identified are fed into the analytics engine, which has hundreds of detection
    policies to help us rectify the same kinds of problems for multiple customers.

    our roadmap. Eventually, the full stack of products will be available on VMware
    Skyline. Our insights will get better with time, adding more predictive recommendations
    to reduce downtime and performance issues. VMware Skyline matures as the rules
    engine evolves in scope and complexity, so the value to customers will continue
    to grow. Customers will also be able to add and remove individual product deployments
    from collection. Skyline is available through the VMware managed access program
    at no cost for premier support customers (Mission Critical, Healthcare Critical,
    and Business Critical) with vSphere and NSX on-premises environments.

    and during the initial rollout. It is best to collect from a single vCenter, have
    the customer give us feedback on the value that we're providing, and then keep
    adding incrementally. There will be some scale scenarios that we will hit in the
    real world that we will never encounter in testing, and we can identify those
    through a measured adoption plan. We don't recommend any aggressive approaches
    to an initial enterprise software drop. The collector attaches itself to a vCenter.
    It can connect to multiple vCenters, as well, but it can always be split on a
    per-vCenter basis. Very large, multi-vCenter environments will also require multi-collector
    setups. The collector appliance should also be as near to the vCenter as possible,
    in terms of network traffic, so as to not stress sending data over the WAN. Multiple
    physical data centers will also lean toward multi-collector setups for each location.
    Data is tied together on the backend, so we know that it all came from the same
    customer.

    and for up to four years for other collected data. Product-related data is saved
    and used for different processes, along with the end-to-end security for this
    data. We can manage data and de-identify as required. We can encrypt data in storage
    and in motion, as well as all kinds of all kinds of physical security such as
    firewall, HIPS, IDS, and so on. We can also design data backups, disaster recovery,

    This will help us to lower the time to solve an issue and identify problems before
    they turn into service availability, performance, or patch/security issues. Data
    that's collected by Skyline is stored in US-based VACs that are only operated
    by VMware. Snapshots of the protocols and encryptions are used with Skyline. Upstream
    encryption is done via TLS 1.2, using the cipher suite `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`.

    of the customer's environment has many benefits. If we know and understand what
    our customers are doing, we can more readily engage with them proactively, in
    order to provide assistance and guidance.​ We can start to focus on the core problems
    when supporting them, so that we do not only rely on the symptoms that our customers
    describe. This drives confidence as we build and strengthen those relationships.​ At
    the core of VMware Skyline is a focus on transforming the customer experience,
    and the key way that we can do so is by building customer intimacy.​ We can start
    to focus on the core issues of customers with these reliable data rather then
    relying only on the symptoms or, customer's inputs.
