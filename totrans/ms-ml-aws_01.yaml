- en: The objective of this section is to introduce readers to machine learning in
    the context of AWS cloud computing and services. We expect our audience to have
    some basic knowledge of machine learning. However, we'll describe the nature of
    a typical successful machine learning project and the challenges often faced.
    We will provide an overview of the different AWS services and provide examples
    of typical machine learning pipelines, along with the key aspects to consider
    in order to create smart AI-powered products.
