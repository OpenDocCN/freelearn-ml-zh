<p class="mce-root"><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is ever-increasingly being interwoven into the complex fabric of our technology-driven lives. Whether we realize it or not, AI is becoming an enabler for us to accomplish our day-to-day tasks more efficiently than we've ever done before. Personal assistants such as Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are some of the most visible AI tools that we come across frequently. Less obvious AI tools are ones such as those used by rideshare firms that suggest drivers move to a high-density area, and adjust prices dynamically based on demand.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Across the world, there are organizations at different stages of the AI journey. To some organizations, AI is the core of their business model. In other organizations, they see the potential of leveraging AI to compete and innovate their business. Successful organizations recognize that digital transformation through AI is key to their survival over the long term. Sometimes, this involves changing an organization's business model to incorporate AI through new technologies such as the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>). Across this spectrum of AI maturity, organizations face challenges implementing AI solutions. Challenges are typically related to scalability, algorithms, libraries, accuracy, retraining, pipelines, integration with other systems, and so on.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The field of AI has been around for several decades now, but it's growth and adoption over the last decade has been tremendous. This can be attributed to three main drivers: large data, large compute, and enhanced algorithms. The growth in data stems mostly from entities that generate data, or from human interactions with those entities. The growth in compute can be attributed to improved chip design, as well as innovative compute technologies. Algorithms have improved partly due to the open source community and partly due to the availability of larger data and compute.</p>

<p>Developing AI solutions in the cloud helps organizations leapfrog their innovation, in addition to alleviating the challenges described here. One of the first steps is to bring all the data close together or in the same tool for easy retrieval. The cloud is the most optimal landing zone that meets this requirement. The cloud provides near-infinite storage, easy access to other data sources, and on-demand compute. Solutions that are built on the cloud are easier to maintain and update, due to there being a single pane of control. The availability of improved or customized hardware at the click of a button was unthinkable a few years back.</p>

<p><span>Any cloud AI solution will have different components, all modular, individually elastic, and integrated with each other. A broad framework for cloud AI is depicted in the following diagram</span><span>. At the very base is</span> <strong>Storage</strong>, <span>which is separate from</span> <strong>Compute</strong><span>. This separation of <strong>Storage</strong> and <strong>Compute</strong> is one of the key benefits of the cloud, which permits the user to scale one separate from the other. <strong>Storage</strong> itself may be tiered based on throughput, availability, and other features. Until a few years back, the</span> <strong>Compute</strong> <span>options were limited to the speed and generation of the underlying CPU chips. Now, we have options for GPU and <strong>FPGA</strong> (short- for <strong>field-programmable gate array</strong>) chips as well. Leveraging <strong>Storage</strong> and <strong>Compute</strong>, various services are built on the cloud fabric, which makes it easier to use ingest data, transform it, and build models. Services based on <strong>Relational Databases</strong>, <strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>Hadoop</strong>, <strong>Spark</strong>, and <strong>Microservices</strong> are some of the most frequent ones used to build AI solutions:</span></p>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Essential building blocks of cloud AI</div>
<p>At the highest level of complexity are the various AI-focused services that are available on the cloud. These services fall on a spectrum with fully customizable solutions at one end, and easy-to-build solutions at the other. <strong>Custom AI</strong> is typically a solution that allows the user to bring in their own libraries or use proprietary ones to build an end-to-end solution. This typically involves a lot of hands-on coding and gives the builder complete control over different parts of the solution. <strong>Pre-Built AI</strong> is typically in the form of APIs that expose some type of service that can be easily incorporated into your solution. Examples of these include custom vision, text, and language-based AI solutions.</p>
<p>However complex the underlying AI may be, the goal of most applications is to make the end user experience as seamless as possible. This means that AI solutions need to integrate with general applications that reside in the organization solution stack. A lot of solutions use <strong>Dashboards</strong> or reports in the traditional BI space. These interfaces allow the user to explore the data generated by the AI solution. <strong>Conversational Apps</strong> are usually in the form of an intelligent interface (such as a bot) that interacts with the user in a conversational mode.</p>

<p>Developers who would like to consume pre-trained AI models, typically use one of Microsoft's Cognitive Services. For those who are building conversational applications, a combination of Bot Framework and Cognitive Services is the recommended path.

<p><strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>Azure ML</strong>) Studio is the primary tool, purely a web-based GUI, to help build <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) models. Azure<strong> </strong>ML Studio is an almost code-free environment that allows the user to build end-to-end ML solutions. It has Microsoft Research's proprietary algorithms built in, which can do most machine learning tasks with real simplicity. It can also embed Python or R code to enhance its functionality. One of the greatest features of Azure ML Studio is the ability to create a web service in a single click. The web service is exposed in the form of a REST endpoint that applications can send data to. In addition to the web service, an Excel spreadsheet is also created, which accesses the same web service and can be used to test the model's functionality and share it easily with end users.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the primary limitation with <span>Azure </span>ML Studio is the 10 GB limit on an experiment container. This limit will be explained in detail in <a href="f6d8b2f5-a038-41fe-892f-4720ef071fd9.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Scalable Computing for Data Science</em>, but for now, it is sufficient to understand that <span>Azure </span>ML Studio is well-suited to training datasets that are in the 2 GB to 5 GB range. In addition, there are also limits to the amount of R and Python code that you can <span>include in</span> ML Studio, and its performance, which will be discussed in detail later.</p>

<p>For a code-first experience, there are multiple tools available in the Microsoft portfolio. If organizations are looking to deploy on-premises (in addition to the cloud), the only option available is <strong>Machine Learning Server</strong> (<strong>ML Server</strong>). ML Server is an enterprise platform that supports both R and Python applications. It supports all the activities involved in the ML process end-to-end. ML Server was previously known as <strong>R Server</strong> and came about through Microsoft's acquisition of revolution analytics. Later, Python support was added to handle the variety of user preferences.</p>

<p><span>Azure </span>ML Services is a relatively new service on Azure that enhances productivity in the process of building AI solutions. <span>Azure </span>ML Services has different components. On the user's end, <span>Azure </span>ML Workbench is a tool that allows users to pull in data, transform it, build models, and run them against various kinds of compute. Workbench is a tool that users run on their local machines and connect to <span>Azure </span>ML services. <span>Azure </span>ML Services itself runs on Azure and consists of experimentation and model management for ML. The experimentation service keeps track of model testing, performance, and any other metrics you would like to track while building a model. The model management service helps manage the deployment of models and manages the overall life cycle of multiple models built by individual users or large teams.</p>
<p>When leveraging <span>Azure </span>ML Services, there are multiple endpoints that can act as engines for the services. At the time of writing, only Python-based endpoints are supported. SQL Server, with the introduction of built-in Python services, can act as an endpoint. This is beneficial, especially if the user has most of the data in SQL tables and wants to minimize data movement.</p>
<p>If you have leveraged Spark libraries for ML at scale on ML Services, then you can deploy to Spark-based solutions on Azure. Currently, these can be either Spark on HDInsight, or any other native implementation of Apache Spark (Cloudera, Hortonworks, and so on).</p>
<p>If the user has leveraged other Hadoop-based libraries to build ML Services, then those can be deployed to HDInsight or any of the Apache Hadoop implementations available on Azure.</p>
<p>Azure Batch is a service that provides large-scale, on-demand compute for applications that require such resources on an ad hoc or scheduled basis. The typical workflow for this use case involves the creation of a VM cluster, followed by the submission of jobs to the cluster. After the job is completed, the cluster is destroyed, and users do not pay for any compute afterward.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data Science Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong>DSVM</strong>) is a highly customized VM template built on either Linux or Windows. It comes pre-installed with a huge variety of curated data science tools and libraries. All the tools and libraries are configured to work straight out of the box with minimal effort. The DSVM has multiple applications, which we will cover in <a href="b88febb4-e8e4-4a08-9f62-5495654f3842.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Machine Learning Server</em>, including utilization as a base image VM for Azure Batch.</p>
<p>One of the most highly scalable targets for running models built by <span>Azure </span>ML Services is to leverage containers through Docker and orchestration via Kubernetes. This is made easier by leveraging <strong>Azure Kubernetes Services</strong> (<strong>AKS</strong>). <span>Azure </span>ML Services creates a Docker image that helps operationalize an ML model. The model itself is deployed as containerized Docker-based web services, while leveraging frameworks such as TensorFlow, and Spark. Applications can access this web service as a REST API. The web services can be scaled up and down by leveraging the scaling features of Kubernetes. More details on this topic will be covered in <a href="3196eb4a-070f-4b7b-9e15-f8cdc23398f8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Building Deep Learning Solutions</em>.</p>
<p>The challenge with <span>Azure </span>ML Services is that it currently only supports Python. The platform itself has gone through some changes, and the heavy reliance on the command-line interface makes the interface not as user-friendly as some other tools.</p>

<p>Azure Databricks is one of the newest additions to the tools that can be used to build custom AI solutions on Azure. It is based on Apache Spark, but is optimized for use on the Azure platform. The Spark engine can be accessed by various APIs that can be based on Scala, Python, R, SQL, or Java. To leverage the scalability of Spark, users need to leverage Spark libraries when dealing with data objects and their transformations. Azure Databricks leverages these scalable libraries on top of highly elastic and scalable Spark clusters that are managed by the runtime. Databricks comes with enterprise-grade security, compliance, and collaboration features that distinguish it from Apache Spark.
