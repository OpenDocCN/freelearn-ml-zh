<p>Data mining is about finding hidden patterns and associations in data. A large number of analyses that can only be performed by a human in a reasonable time if the amount of data is small, can be done by a computer in a very short time. Before Excel 2016, it was possible to install an add-in (called <strong>Data Mining</strong>) that was packed with different methods and models that could be used, mostly as black boxes, to get insights and discover information in any dataset. Microsoft then changed its policy and started migrating this capability to the cloud, first to Office 365 and, most recently, to Azure. It is also possible to calculate many things in Excel, with built-in functions and even with the help of macros programmed in <strong>Visual Basic Applications</strong> (<strong>VBA</strong>). Here, we will show two cases where data mining can help us find important information hidden in our data.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning by example: Market Basket Analysis</li>
<li><span>Learning by example: </span>Customer Cohort Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Market Basket Analysis studies which pairs of product/services are often bought together by customers. Customer Cohort Analysis analyses which customers are still buying products/services after a given amount of time and which ones <em>churn</em>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>We have all read the sentence in almost every online store: <em>People who bought this product also bought...</em>. It all started with Amazon in the 1990s, and it is widespread today. This same principle is even being tested in physical stores, where customers can get personalized suggestions on which items to buy based on their shopping history and similarity with other products. These techniques are generally known as cross-selling, and they are useful since it is often easier to sell an additional product to an existing customer than to acquire a new one.</p>
<p>In this section, we will show a simplified example of Market Basket Analysis, which is the type of data mining technique behind these recommender systems. T<span>he results might not be as accurate as those obtained with more advanced methods, but are still useful to explain the method and to teach how to escalate it. </span></p>
<p>We will use a list of commercial transactions downloaded from <a href="https://data.world/">https://data.world/</a>. Start by loading the <kbd>transactions_by_dept.csv</kbd><span> file the usual way. Navigate to</span> <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> | <span class="packt_screen">From Text/CSV</span> <span>and select the file.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>You will need to edit the table in Power Query to change the data type of the first column to <span class="packt_screen">Text</span>, since it contains the transaction ID, and will probably be interpreted as a number and truncated by Excel.</span></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>The resulting table looks like this:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d202be3a-3433-4c26-84b5-b9ea0a2e93fd.png" style="width:28.42em;height:28.00em;"/></p>
<p>In this particular example, we will concentrate only on the first two columns. <kbd>POS Txn</kbd><em> </em>contains the transaction ID, while <kbd>Dept</kbd> shows a description of the department where the transaction took place. Our goal is to find out how frequently the same customer shops in different departments in one single transaction. </p>
<p>In our findings we will see obvious, uninteresting combinations; unexpected ones that can be explained and exploited (for example, by offering products sold in one department when shopping in a related one), and combinations we cannot explain (which might occur by chance or simply need further investigation).</p>
<p>To start our analysis, we need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Group all transactions by transaction number.</li>
<li>Build a list of all the departments visited in each particular purchase.</li>
</ol>

<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>To perform these tasks, we will use the Power Query capabilities, following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> | <span class="packt_screen">From Table/Range.</span></li>
<li>Make sure that the data type of the <kbd>POS Txn</kbd> column is set to <span class="packt_screen">Text</span> before continuing.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Group by</span><em>.</em> You will see the following pop-up window:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/35d06f1d-2e2a-4c55-9135-176351c9a222.png" style="width:43.67em;height:18.75em;"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Select the grouping by <kbd>POS Txn</kbd>,<em> </em>change the name of the new column to something meaningful, like <kbd>Concat_dept</kbd> (since we are trying to concatenate all departments visited in one purchase in a single string), and select any <span class="packt_screen">Operation</span><em>.</em> Click<span> the </span><span class="packt_screen">OK</span><em> </em>button at the lower-right corner of the window, similar to the one shown in the preceding screenshot.</li>
<li>Change the calculation formula manually to get the data transformation we want. <span>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">View</span> and make sure that <span class="packt_screen">Formula Bar</span> is selected. If not, select it, and you will see the following formula:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><em>= Table.Group(#"Changed Type", {"POS Txn"}, {{"Concat_dept", each Table.RowCount(_), type number}})</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The preceding formula is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/685d3625-7faf-4ca3-a863-52e5ec1d052b.png" style="width:56.08em;height:10.33em;"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The formula must be replaced by the following:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><em>= Table.Group(#"Changed Type", {"POS Txn"}, {{"Concat_dept", each Text.Combine([Dept]," | "), type text}})</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The difference is that, instead of counting rows in the table (<em>Table.RowCount</em>), we concatenate them, using <em>"|"</em> as a delimiter (<em>Text.Combine</em>). We are also changing the output type to <em>text. </em>The output should look similar to this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/86e13d24-162e-4a68-9295-071d69eb5056.png" style="width:50.58em;height:19.00em;"/></p>
<p>For each transaction ID, we now have a string representing the list of the departments involved. We are going to use this table to count the combinations of departments, but first, we convert it to a range:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on any cell within the table and go to <span class="packt_screen">Table</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Convert to Range</span>.</li>
<li>Rename the sheet to <kbd>Concat depts</kbd><em> </em>(use the same name so that the references in future functions are correct).</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In a real-life example, we might have to limit the time period we are analyzing to reduce the amount of calculations needed and clean the data, leaving out unusual transactions (outliers). In our case, we will limit the number of combinations studied. We could take the departments in pairs, triads, or even larger numbers. The problem is that the number of combinations quickly scales with the number of departments. In fact, this number can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/a55b261b-4b99-4605-8b01-025b39de83f7.png" style="width:5.00em;height:2.42em;"/></p>
<p>Here, <em>m</em> is the total number of elements and <em>n</em> is the number of elements in each combination. This calculation takes into account that the elements cannot be repeated (it doesn't make sense to compare a department with itself), and the order is irrelevant.</p>
<p>We will select the top 10 departments according to the number of transactions and calculate the combinations using Excel functions. In order to do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <span class="packt_screen">PivotTable</span> as shown in the following screenshot: </li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c64a6138-e705-434d-94f3-0b20dba90d67.png" style="width:55.50em;height:23.08em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Order the rows by the count of transactions to get the top 10:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px">0982:SPIRITS<br/>0973:CANDY<br/>0962:BEVERAGES<br/>0597:HEALTH AIDS<br/>0983:WINE<br/>0991:TOBACCO<br/>0836:HOUSEHOLD CLEANING<br/>0604:PERSONAL CARE<br/>0603:BEAUTY CARE<br/>0984:BEER</pre>
<p>How can we easily build all possible combinations of two departments? It is simple if we define the cell contents correctly and use the copy feature built in to Excel.</p>
<p>Let's assume that the 10 departments are listed in cells <em>A1:A10</em>. Then follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create two new columns that you can label <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd>.</li>
<li>Define the first cell in column <kbd>X</kbd> as <em>=$A$1</em> and the first cell in column <kbd>Y</kbd> as <em>=A2.</em></li>
<li>Select both cells and copy them down until column <kbd>Y</kbd> shows an empty value. Remember that the <em>$</em> symbol fixes the cell value when copying.</li>
<li>You will get a list as shown in the following screenshot, containing all possible <kbd>X-Y</kbd> pairs of departments:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/17b2795a-2542-4ff3-b956-053b80d2dfd5.png" style="width:20.50em;height:11.92em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>In the cells following the last in this list, define <kbd>X</kbd> as <em>= $A$2</em> and <kbd>Y</kbd> as <em>= A3</em>.</li>
<li>Repeat the copy operation. If you continue until defining <kbd>X</kbd> as <em>= $A$9</em> and <kbd>Y</kbd> as <em>= A10</em>, you will get the full list of combinations.</li>
<li>The total number of elements should be as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/03d5fd46-e562-4299-babd-f7a4cc68dca1.png" style="width:22.08em;height:2.58em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Going back to our <kbd>Cancat depts</kbd> sheet, we need to count the number of transactions in which each pair appears in the same transaction (<kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd>) and the number of times that each department appears. We will define two functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Here, we assume that the concatenated department names are in column <em>B</em> <span>in the <kbd>Concat depts</kbd>  sheet</span><em> </em><span>(this is why it needs to be named like that; if you understand the function you can change the name), and columns <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> contain the <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd> list respectively. The two <em>COUNTIF</em> functions account for the fact that the department names can appear in a different order, as shown in the following formula: </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>X&amp;Y = =COUNTIF('Concat depts'!$B$2:$B$2065;"*"&amp;C2&amp;"*"&amp;D2&amp;"*")+COUNTIF('Concat depts'!$B$2:$B$2065;"*"&amp;D2&amp;"*"&amp;C2&amp;"*")</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>We copy the following formulas until we reach the last element, that is, number <kbd>45</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><em>X = COUNTIF('Concat depts'!$B$2:$B$2065;"*"&amp;C2&amp;"*")</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>We will calculate the following:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>Support = X&amp;Y/N</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>Confidence = X&amp;Y/X</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Here, <em>N</em> is the total number of transactions. <em>Support</em><span> represents the frequency of the rule (combination of departments) in the data, and </span><em>Confidence</em><span> is an estimation of the conditional probability of a transaction involving the <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd> departments at the same time. </span>Adding these two columns, we get a table as shown in the following screenshot, showing the results of the calculations:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7dca0b75-28a6-47c1-be40-800864c252c8.png" style="width:38.50em;height:29.33em;"/></p>
<p>The calculations we have just performed are the basis of the Apriori algorithm, published by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for finding frequent item sets in a dataset for Boolean association rules, so named because it uses prior knowledge of frequent item set properties. The Apriori algorithm is also useful in mining frequent item sets and relevant association rules. Usually, this algorithm is used to operate on a database containing a large number of transactions, such as items that customers buy at a supermarket. It helps customers to easily make their purchases and enhances the sales performance of the store. It is important to notice that the correlation between items does not imply causation; for example, that buying one item causes someone to buy another. </p>
<p>In a real-world scenario, we would choose the combinations with the largest <em>Support</em> and <em>Confidence</em> above a certain threshold, and study those insights. Apart from obvious rules, such as people shopping at the spirits and wine departments in the same purchase, we will find other combinations that we didn't expect. The main point is to find actionable insights; that is, those we can do something about. We can offer new articles, combine them in promotions, and advertise them in different places.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are a large number of possibilities. The important thing is that the machine has learned hidden associations and has given us useful information about our own business. It is extremely important that it is not only machine learning specialists who are a part of these analyses, but also people involved in the business should give their impressions and use their experience and knowledge to turn this information into an economic benefit.</p>
<p>Can a full analysis be carried out in Excel? Should we limit ourselves to a toy model if we don't have access to more advanced tools? Of course not! Excel is extremely powerful and able to be used in advanced analyses, but we need to know how to write a little VBA code in macros.</p>
<p>The concept of Market Basket Analysis should be clear now, and we can move forward to another example of customer behavior analysis.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Learning by example – Customer Cohort Analysis</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>An excellent way of gaining insights about a company's customers and their behavior is to perform a segmented analysis. These segments are groups of customers that share the same characteristics and are usually called <strong>cohorts</strong>. Their definition depends very much on the type of business we are dealing with.</p>
<p>The dataset we will analyze contains a list of customer IDs, the date when they first purchased something from us, the day they left us, and the mean amount of money spent per month. What does "left us<em>"</em> mean in this context? It is mainly a matter of definition. For example, if we refer to a credit card, we could consider that the customer left when they cancelled the card, or maybe we want to go further and say that if the customer did not spend any money for two or three months, we consider that they have left.</p>
<p>Our grouping will then be based on the starting date. We will study how many customers <strong>churned</strong>, or abandoned us in a given period.</p>
<p>The <strong>Lifetime Value of a Customer</strong> (<strong>LTV</strong>) often refers to the gross profit generated by this customer over the whole period that they stayed with us. Both analyses together help us decide which customers we must retain and which actions were more effective in acquiring more valuable customers in terms of monthly spend and fidelity.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The analysis comprises the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the <kbd><span>cohort_input_data.csv</span></kbd> <span>input file, </span>navigating to <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> | <span class="packt_screen">From Text/CSV</span> <span>and selecting it.</span></li>
<li><span>The two date columns, <kbd>Date in</kbd> and <kbd>Date out</kbd>, look better and are easier to understand if we choose the</span> <em>month-year</em> format <span>for them. Select the columns, right-click on them, and click on</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>Format</span> Cells</span>. A pop-up window, like the one in the following screenshot, will appear:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/18076bf4-8444-4adc-bd25-3b955addd14a.png" style="width:32.67em;height:30.92em;"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add two columns: <kbd>Cohort</kbd>, which in this case is equal to <kbd>Date in</kbd>, and <kbd>Active months</kbd>, which we can calculate as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>=DATEDIF(B2;C2;"m")</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This assumes that column <em>B</em> contains the <kbd>Data in</kbd> values and column <em>C</em> contains the <kbd>Data out</kbd> values.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Copy this formula to the remaining cells. The resulting table, sorted by <kbd>Date in</kbd>, <span>is as follows:</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bb8f39f7-2083-4345-9b9b-0f459a662794.png" style="width:29.17em;height:23.67em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Rename this sheet <kbd>Customer data</kbd> for future reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, we will study how well we retained customers over the lifetime of a given cohort. Each group will tell us what actions to repeat and which to avoid to prevent customer churn. We will use the <em>COUNTIFS</em> <span>Excel function </span>to count the number of active customers per month in each cohort:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a matrix with 48 rows, from zero to the largest difference in months in our dataset (48 months), and one column per month, from <kbd>Feb-15</kbd> to <kbd>Jan-19</kbd>. An example of this matrix can be seen in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dfca291b-2ee9-4a2a-944c-1639f8e2e841.png" style="width:56.42em;height:21.83em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Add a row at the end of the table to calculate the total number of customers in each cohort by using the following formula:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>=COUNTIF('Customer</em> data'!$E$2:$E$751;"="&amp;C$1)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This is because column <em>E</em> in the <kbd>Customer data</kbd> sheet contains the list of cohorts, and row one contains the list of cohorts in our matrix.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Copy the cell contents to all cells to the right in the table, and, since the row is fixed, the correct values are calculated for each column, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bba4ea96-0edf-4e25-ad55-7329cc445b95.png"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the first cell of the matrix, write the following formula:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>=COUNTIFS('Customer data'!$E$2:$E$751;"="&amp;C$1;'Customer data'!$C$2:$C$751;"&gt;"&amp;EOMONTH(C$1;$B1))/C$52</em></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Let's see in detail what it means:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>We only count if the contents of <em>C1</em> (<kbd>Feb-15</kbd>, the current cohort) are part of the list of cohorts in column <em>E</em> in<em> </em>the <kbd>Customer data</kbd> sheet.</li>
<li>We count if <kbd>Date out</kbd> (<span>column </span><em>C</em> in<em> </em><span>the </span><kbd>Customer data</kbd><span> sheet</span> ) is larger than the current cohort plus the number of months in column <em>B</em>. We use the <span><em>EOMONTH</em> function to deal with the fact that we might have full dates as inputs, and not just months and years. Check the definition of this function in Excel help.</span></li>
<li><span>We finally divide this by the total number of customers to get a percentage.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Copy the formula to the whole matrix.</li>
<li>Format the cells as a percentage.</li>
<li>Format the cells conditionally using a three-color scale. The result looks like the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/75ab0c52-61ac-4180-9d12-e0c2454c64e6.png" style="width:55.75em;height:21.67em;"/></p>
<p>We can see, for example, that after 20 months, only 19% of the customers acquired in <kbd>Feb-15</kbd> remain. The color scale also shows that some cohorts show a faster churn than others. It is now necessary for the business expert to evaluate what actions were actions taken during each time period and repeat or change them.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We know now how many customers we were able to keep, but what was their value? They do not spend the same amount, so we need to include that variable in the analysis. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a similar matrix, with the month number and cohorts, but now we will use a different formula:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px" class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><em>=SUMIFS('Customer</em> data'!$D$2:$D$751;'Customer data'!$E$2:$E$751;"="&amp;C$1;'Customer data'!$C$2:$C$751;"&gt;"&amp;EOMONTH(C$1;$B1))</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This formula means that we only sum the values on the<span> </span><kbd>Customer data</kbd> sheet in <span>column <em>D</em> if two conditions are met:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>If the summed values correspond to the cohort in <em>C1</em></li>
<li>If <kbd>Date out</kbd> is larger than the current cohort, that is, the customer is still with us</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Copy the cell value to the whole matrix.</li>
<li>Format the table in a similar way as before to get a colored matrix, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p>In this case, we can see how the amount of money spent changes with time for each cohort, and it is slightly different then the raw number of customers.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned about two data mining techniques: Market Basket Analysis and Customer Cohort Analysis. The first one tells us about hidden relations between store departments or products based on the customers' behavior. The second shows the time evolution of the number of customers, revealing differences between different customer segments or cohorts.</p>
<p>There are a large number of data mining analyses that can help us dig into our datasets and find hidden information, which is extremely important in order for us to understand our business and make the right decisions.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will study a special kind of dataset<span> </span><span>in detail</span><span>: time series. We will see that it needs a different kind of modeling and analysis.</span></p>

<li>How can the unexplainable, random associations be avoided in a Market Basket Analysis?</li>
<li>If we find a correlation between two products or two departments in a given store, can this be generalized to other places?</li>
<li>Some columns in the cohort matrix show zeroes starting at a given date. What does this mean in the context of the current dataset?</li>
<li>The last rows in the cohort matrix show zero consistently. What does this mean in the context of the current dataset?</li>
<li>How would you maximize the amount of money spent by customers as time passes? </li>
