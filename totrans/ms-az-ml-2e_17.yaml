- en: In this final section, we will bring our models into production by deploying
    them to a cluster for batch scoring or to endpoints for online scoring and we
    will learn how to monitor these deployments. Furthermore, we will discuss specialized
    deployment targets and available integrations with other Azure services. Bringing
    everything we learned together, we will then learn how to operate enterprise-grade
    end-to-end **Machine Learning** (**ML**) projects using MLOps concepts and Azure
    DevOps. Finally, we will end the book with a summary of what we learned, having
    a look at what can and will change and gaining an understanding of our responsibility
    when building ML models and working with data.
