- en: R was one of the first programming languages developed for statistical computing
    and data analysis with excellent support for visualization. With the rise of data
    science, R emerged as an undoubtedly good choice of programming language among
    many data science practitioners. Since R was open source and extremely powerful
    in building sophisticated statistical models, it quickly found adoption in both
    industry and academia.

- en: '*Applied Supervised Learning with R* covers the complete process of using R
    to develop applications using supervised machine learning algorithms that cater
    to your business needs. Your learning curve starts with developing your analytical
    thinking to create a problem statement using business inputs or domain research.
    You will learn about many evaluation metrics that compare various algorithms,
    and you will then use these metrics to select the best algorithm for your problem.
    After finalizing the algorithm you want to use, you will study hyperparameter
    optimization techniques to fine-tune your set of optimal parameters. To avoid
    overfitting your model, you will also be shown how to add various regularization
    terms. You will also learn about deploying your model into a production environment.'

    machine learning algorithms to precisely fulfill your business needs.
