- en: The primary difference between RPA and IA lies in the *certainty of outcomes*
    and *risk*. In some cases, people implement so-called “IA” that doesn’t incur
    any risk. A Chatbot interface that classifies human input, which further triggers
    traditional RPA to run, falls into this category. While there’s ML in the chatbot
    portion, the risk is contained and resolved before RPA even begins. For these
    types of IA Processes, you really only need to know how to interface with the
    ML part (see *Chapters 1*, *2*, and *3*), and this chapter can be omitted.

    process outcomes, you’re hopefully convinced that designing an IA process to accommodate
    HITL should be standard practice, even if the team decides to keep HITL turned
    off. There could be an update to the prediction model, regulatory changes, new
    business requirements, and so on that will lead to enabling HITL reviews again.

    decisions that an IA Solution Designer must make. Almost all of the other design
    elements, such as whether to use Tags, Statuses, Deferrals, and so on depend on
    these two decisions. This chapter discusses when to choose *one versus multiple
    Processes* and *one versus multiple Work Queues* when implementing IA in BP. It’s
    important to keep in mind that this discussion focuses specifically on IA – meaning
    a design that enables ML prediction and HITL review afterward. Other use-case-specific
    design topics involving Work Queues, such as parent-child Queues, won’t be presented.

    current Item to be reviewed so that it can continue processing. Instead, the Process
    suspends work on the current Item that needs HITL review and moves on to the next
    one. This is probably how most IA Processes should be designed since reviewers

    the Item is actually reviewed.

    people consider it easier to maintain than a multi-Process solution. My view is
    that having too much in a single Process – in our case, the business logic, the
    ML calling code, and the HITL logic – makes the solution less maintainable. Containing
    everything in a single Process prevents multiple developers from editing it at
    once, which is undesirable if there’s lots of logic there.

    don’t want an Exception that occurs in the review-checking logic to cause an Item
    that’s being worked on to be an Exception as well. The compromise that’s made
    by placing checking logic outside the Work Block is that the Process can Terminate
    if an Exception happens there. A *two*-Process design can decouple the review-checking
    logic from the actual business process logic, mitigating this issue.

- en: Another concern with this design lies in the amount of time spent performing
    the review checking versus actually processing a case. They’re two relatively
    independent activities that need to run within the same Session. Depending on
    actual conditions, you might spend so much time in the review-checking logic that
    it *negatively impacts the throughput of working cases*. Imagine that checking
    for completed reviews requires logging in to a custom website. If this website
    is slow or requires lots of navigation between pages, the gap between picking
    up cases using **Get Next Item** due to checking for completed reviews can become
    very large.

    aren’t any clear reasons to do so for IA. As a general design rule, avoid having
    multiple Work Queues for a single BP Process. It’s difficult to follow the Process
    flow when there are multiple Work Queues that can be the source of an Item that’s
    worked on, reducing maintainability. An exception to this is if the additional
    Work Queues aren’t a source of Items to be worked on, such as for Parent/Child
    Work Queue designs where only Item Statuses, Tags, or Data are updated.

- en: Under the context of IA, there are three broad reasons why you might want to
    have multiple BP Processes working on only a *single* Work Queue. The first is
    to *keep distinct pieces of logic separate*. We will see an example of this later
    in the section, which has one BP Process primarily for the business logic and
    other Processes to house logic specific to the ML portions of the solution design.
    Keeping these separate makes future modifications to the business logic easier
    to manage.
  id: totrans-131
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next reason is closely related to the first one. We can separate a solution
    into different Processes to *promote reusability*. As you can imagine, the logic
    to implement random sampling, thresholding, notifying reviewers that predictions
    are ready for review, and so on, are potentially interchangeable across multiple
    IA Processes, and could be implemented as their own Process.
  id: totrans-132
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third reason is to enable different sections of the overall process to *scale
    differently*. Imagine that we’re putting a new IA process into production and
    that the random sampling percentage is set to 100%, to force human review of every
    ML prediction during hypercare. If there’s a BP Process dedicated specifically
    to checking for reviewed predictions, we can run it on more Digital Workers to
    prevent bottlenecks during this time. Once we’re happy with the accuracy and performance
    of the ML model, the random sampling percentage and the number of Sessions that
    the review-checking Process needs can be lowered.

    is completed by looping through the contents of a *completed folder*. This completed
    folder could instead be an API call, a database, or some other system. Files or
    records in the “completed location” *must* contain a reference to the *Item ID*
    somewhere. BP must be able to lock the Item based on the Item ID to update its
    Status so that it can continue automated processing as required.

    standpoint. Someone could accidentally (or deliberately) modify the Item ID. This

    the Work Queue for Items that are pending review. Unfortunately, **Get Next Item**
    can’t filter based on Status. We can, however, filter Work Queues based on *Tags*,
    which we’ll implement in an example shortly. We’ll also need to store a reference
    to the file path or third-party system ID as Work Queue Data so that the Item
    ID doesn’t need to be exposed to the reviewer.
  id: totrans-147

    can ensure that the review data is persisted correctly and recreate it if it isn’t.

    contents of the completed folder, and not the full set of everything that needs

    *single*-Work Queue example to prevent exposing the Item ID to reviewers. While
    it would work technically, in practice, it takes too much time away from actually
    working the Items according to business logic. Recall that the review-checking
    logic in our previous example was positioned outside of the Main Page’s Work Block.
    If the number of Items pending review is high or if checking to see whether a
    pending Item has been reviewed takes more than a few seconds, we can end up spending
    significant amounts of time just doing this checking.

    *outside* the Work Block of the Process Template. Exceptions that occur outside
    the Work Block potentially result in Terminations. With a two-Process design,
    review logic can be placed into its own Work Block. Exceptions that occur no longer
    lead to immediate Termination. This makes this design well-suited for scenarios
    where checking for a completed review has complex logic, such as logging into
    a web interface.

    are two Processes instead of just one, I’d argue that it’s now easier to maintain
    the primary Process that contains the business logic, since much of the IA solution
    logic has been moved out. It’s the business logic that’s more apt to change over
    the lifetime of an IA solution. Moving to a two-Process design also enables reuse

    versus the time spent in manual review logic is useful, the reporting and Control
    Room operations can become more complex. If you want a view of how long an Item
    takes to complete, including the review logic time, the case durations of the
    two Queues need to be added together in your reporting. This should really only
    be a one-off change to the automated reporting that’s put into place, though.
    The Controller also needs to navigate between two Work Queues, while remembering
    the *Item Key*, to get a full picture of what’s happening with an Item, which

    Items that need human review into a separate Work Queue. This allows us to isolate
    case statistics, separating the time spent performing review logic (saving the
    data to be shared with reviewers and checking for completed reviews) from the
    time spent performing business logic. The trade-off that’s made when isolating
    these statistics is that we might want an end-to-end view of the time spent on
    a case. This requires adding the case times from two Work Queues together. Operationally,
    adding another Work Queue makes tracking cases in the Control Room more difficult
    for the Controller.

    Queues is extremely important for both IA and general RPA design as it affects
    almost every aspect of the remaining solution. This includes the potential scalability,
    case reporting statistics, maintainability, logging, auditability, scheduling,
    and other Control Room operations.

    Queue. One design was for synchronous reviews and the other for asynchronous reviews.
    In our third design, we split off the logic used to handle HITL reviews into its
    own Process, leading to a two-Process, single-Work Queue design. This allows for
    increased reusability and the separate scaling of business logic versus HITL review
    logic. For the fourth design, we added a new Work Queue to store all the Items
    that need manual review. This provides a simpler audit trail into which predictions
    were corrected by a human. It also allows us to more easily feed back these corrected
    predictions to the ML team. Finally, our fifth design further split off all of
    the ML calling logic into its own Work Queue and Process, enhancing scalability
    and simplifying the auditing of all ML predictions.
