- en: Welcome to *Active Learning with Python* a comprehensive guide designed to introduce
    you to the power of active machine learning. This book is written with the conviction
    that while data is plentiful, its quality and relevance hold the key to building
    models that are not only efficient but also robust and insightful.

- en: Active machine learning is a method used in machine learning where the algorithm
    can query an oracle to label new data points with the desired outputs. It stands
    at the crossroads of optimization and human-computer interaction, enabling machines
    to learn more effectively with less data. This is particularly valuable in scenarios
    where data labeling is costly, time-consuming, or requires expert knowledge.

- en: Throughout this book, we leverage Python, a leading programming language in
    the field of data science and machine learning, known for its simplicity and powerful
    libraries. Python serves as an excellent medium for exploring the concepts of
    active machine learning, providing both beginners and experienced practitioners
    with the tools needed to implement sophisticated models.
