- en: In this section, we learn how to take models exported from model building and
    deploy them for scoring on enterprise systems. We first focus on the enterprise-grade
    qualities and technical nature of the H2O MOJO model scoring artifact. We get
    hands-on by writing a batch file scoring program that embeds the MOJO in the program.
    We then show how MOJOs are deployed to diverse enterprise systems by detailing
    over a dozen deployment patterns for real-time, streaming, and batch scoring on
    H2O software, third-party integrations, and custom-built systems.
