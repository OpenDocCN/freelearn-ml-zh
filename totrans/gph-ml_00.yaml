    and leveraging the power of the relationship between entities that can be used
    for predictive, modeling, and analytics tasks.

- en: 'You will start with a brief introduction to graph theory and Graph Machine
    Learning, learning to understand their potential. As you proceed, you will become
    well versed with the main machine learning models for graph representation learning:
    their purpose, how they work, and how they can be implemented in a wide range
    of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. You''ll then build a complete
    machine learning pipeline, including data processing, model training, and prediction,
    in order to exploit the full potential of graph data. Moving on, you will cover
    real-world scenarios, such as extracting data from social networks, text analytics,
    and natural language processing using graphs and financial transaction systems
    on graphs. Finally, you will learn how to build and scale out data-driven applications
    for graph analytics to store, query, and process network information, before progressing
    to explore the latest trends on graphs.'

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data analysts, graph developers, graph analysts, and graph
    professionals who want to leverage the information embedded in the connections
    and relations between data points, unravel hidden structures, and exploit topological
    information to boost their analysis and models' performance. The book will also
    be useful for data scientists and machine learning developers who want to build
    machine learning-driven graph databases. A beginner-level understanding of graph
    databases and graph data is required. An intermediate-level working knowledge
    of Python programming and machine learning is also expected to make the most out
    of this book.
