<p class="mce-root">This book will cover the topic of feature engineering. A huge part of the data science and machine learning pipeline, feature engineering includes the ability to identify, clean, construct, and discover new characteristics of data for the purpose of interpretation and predictive analysis.</p>
<p>In this book, we will be covering the entire process of feature engineering, from inspection to visualization, transformation, and beyond. We will be using both basic and advanced mathematical measures to transform our data into a form that's much more digestible by machines and machine learning pipelines.</p>
<p>By discovering and transforming, we, as data scientists, will be able to gain a whole new perspective on our data, enhancing not only our algorithms but also our insights.</p>

<p>This book is for people who are looking to understand and utilize the practices of feature engineering for machine learning and data exploration.</p>
<p>The reader should be fairly well acquainted with machine learning and coding in Python to feel comfortable diving into new topics with a step-by-step explanation of the basics.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Suppose further that given this dataset, our task is to be able to take in three of the attributes (</span><kbd>datetime</kbd><span>, </span><kbd>protocol</kbd><span>, and </span><kbd>urgent</kbd><span>) and to be able to accurately predict the value of <kbd>malicious</kbd>. In layman's terms, we want a system that can map the values of </span><kbd>datetime</kbd><span>, </span><kbd>protocol</kbd><span>, and </span><kbd>urgent</kbd><span> to the values in <kbd>malicious</kbd>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>Network_features = pd.DataFrame({'datetime': ['6/2/2018', '6/2/2018', '6/2/2018', '6/3/2018'], 'protocol': ['tcp', 'http', 'http', 'http'], 'urgent': [False, True, True, False]})<br/>Network_response = pd.Series([True, True, False, True])<br/>Network_features<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/> datetime protocol  urgent
0  6/2/2018      tcp   False
1  6/2/2018     http    True
2  6/2/2018     http    True
3  6/3/2018     http   False<br/>Network_response<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/> 0     True
1     True

3     True
