    from your morning coffee to driving a car to get to the office, knowing the weather
    forecast, your vaccinations, movies that you watch, flights that you take, games
    that you play, and many other aspects. Many of our actions leave a digital footprint,
    leading to the generation of massive amounts of data. In order to process such
    data, we need a large amount of processing power. HPC, also known as *accelerated
    computing*, aggregates the computing power from a cluster of nodes and divides
    the work among various interconnected processors, to achieve much higher performance
    than could be achieved by using a single computer or machine, as shown in *Figure
    1.1*. This helps in solving complex scientific and engineering problems, in critical
    business applications such as drug discovery, flight simulations, supply chain
    optimization, financial risk analysis, and so on:'

    rapidly and reached 64.2 zettabytes in 2020\. By 2025, the volume of data is estimated
    to grow to more than 180 zettabytes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data growth
    in 2020 reached a new high as more people were learning online and working remotely
    from home. As data is continuously increasing, the need to be able to analyze
    and process it also increases. This is where HPC is a useful mechanism. It helps
    organizations to think beyond their existing capabilities and explore possibilities
    with advanced computing technologies. Today HPC applications, which were once
    confined to large enterprises and academia, are trending across a wide range of
    industries. Some of these industries include material sciences, manufacturing,
    product quality improvement, genomics, numerical optimization, computational fluid
    dynamics, and many more. The list of applications for HPC will continue to increase,

    and other artifacts globally with your teams, without the need to duplicate or
    proliferate sensitive data. For example, building a digital twin (a real-time
    digital counterpart of a physical object) can help in predictive maintenance.
    It can get the state of the object in real time and it monitors and diagnoses
    the object (asset) to optimize its performance and utilization. To build a digital
    twin, a cross-team skill set is needed, which might be remotely located to capture
    data from various IoT sensors, performing extensive what-if analysis and meticulously
    building a simulation model to develop an accurate representation of the physical
    object. The cloud provides a collaboration platform, where different teams can
    interact with a simulation model in near real time, without moving or copying
    data to different locations, and ensures compliance with rapidly changing industry
    regulations. Moreover, you can use native features and services offered by the
    cloud, for example, AWS IoT TwinMaker, which can use the existing data from multiple
    sources, create virtual replicas of physical systems, and combine 3D models to
    give you a holistic view of your operations faster and with less effort. With

    order to design and build an AV, all the components of the system have to work
    in tandem, including planning, perception, and control systems. It also requires
    collecting and processing massive amounts of data and using it to create a feedback
    loop, for vehicles to adjust their state based on the changing condition of the
    traffic on roads in real time. This entails having high I/O performance, networking,
    specialized hardware coprocessors such as GPUs or **Field Programmable Gate Arrays**
    (**FPGAs**), as well as analytics and deep learning frameworks. Moreover, before
    an AV can even start testing on actual roads, it has to undergo millions of miles
    of simulation to demonstrate safety performance, due to the high dimensionality
    of the environment, which is complex and time-consuming. By using the AWS cloud’s
    virtually unlimited compute and storage capacity, support for advanced deep learning
    frameworks, and purpose-built services, you can drive a faster time to market.
    For example, In 2017, Lyft, an American transportation company, launched its AV
    division. To enhance the performance and safety of its system, it uses petabytes
    of data collected from its AV fleet to execute millions of simulations every year,
    which involves a lot of compute power. To run these simulations at a lower cost,
    they decided to take advantage of unused compute capacity on the AWS cloud, by
    using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, which also helped them to increase their capacity
    to run the simulations at this magnitude.
