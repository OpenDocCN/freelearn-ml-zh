- en: Moving data analysis to the cloud is only one part of the way machine learning
    projects have changed over the last few years. Since the benefits of adding automation,
    **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**), and machine learning to many different parts
    of business operations are now clear and don't need further proof, companies are
    now focused on more permanent solutions. In fact, the natural follow-up is to
    think about finished products that can complete the full data cycle, from data
    collection to visualization.

    is created and return results and visualizations after applying machine learning
    models. Cloud services make this task easier and more efficient.

- en: Automatic machine learning is the current tendency in data analysis, where several
    machine learning models can be tested on the same dataset, automatically. Model
    parameters are optimized until the best model is found. This allows the concept
    of the *citizen data scientist*,Â its a role that analyzes data and creates data
    and business models for their companies with the help of big data tools and technologies.
    Citizen data scientists do not necessarily need to be data science or business
    intelligence experts. This role is given to employees in an organization who can
    use the big data tools and technology to create data models.

    learning with the phrase *Let's see what this thing can do...* in mind. That is
    not the case any more. The value of using analytics, machine learning models,
    AI, and advanced visualizations to understand, simplify, and predict the outcome
    of many different situations is clear. This value is measured in terms of money,
    time, and effort savings, which leads to better and faster business decisions.

    learning models need periodic re-training. Cloud services offer ways of doing
    this with minimum intervention, without the need to rebuild any part of the data
    flow. You only need to load new data and specify that you are not building a new
    model but re-training an existing one. After finishing, the model will be available
    for use as usual.

    coding and manual work will be reduced to an absolute minimum.

    to use, improve, and apply machine learning to concrete problems. **Automated
    Machine Learning** (**AutoML**) targets that specific need.
