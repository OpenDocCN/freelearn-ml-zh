<p class="mce-root">OpenCV is one of the most popular libraries used to develop computer vision applications. It enables us to run many different computer vision algorithms in real time. It has been around for many years, and it has become the standard library in this field. One of the main advantages of OpenCV is that it is highly optimized and available on almost all platforms.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book starts off by giving a brief introduction to the various fields in computer vision and the associated OpenCV functionalities in C++. Each chapter contains real-world examples and code samples to demonstrate the use cases. This helps you to easily grasp the topics and understand how they can be applied in real life. To sum up, this is a practical guide on how to use OpenCV in C++ and build various applications using this library.</p>

<p>This book is for developers who are new to OpenCV and want to develop computer vision applications with OpenCV in C++. A basic knowledge of C++ would be helpful in understanding this book. This book is also useful for people who want to get started with computer vision and understand the underlying concepts. They should be aware of basic mathematical concepts, such as vectors, matrices, and matrix multiplication, in order to get the most out of this book. During the course of this book, you will learn how to build various computer vision applications from scratch using OpenCV.</p>

<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "Also, installing this package is optional. OpenCV will work just fine if you don't install <kbd>opencv_contrib</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>// Load image to process 
  Mat img= imread(img_file, 0); 
  if(img.data==NULL){ 
    cout &lt;&lt; "Error loading image "&lt;&lt; img_file &lt;&lt; endl; 
    return 0; 
  } </pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>for(auto i=1; i&lt;num_objects; i++){ 
    <strong>cout &lt;&lt; "Object "&lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " with pos: " &lt;&lt;</strong> centroids.at&lt;Point2d&gt;(i) &lt;&lt; " with area " &lt;&lt; stats.at&lt;int&gt;(i, CC_STAT_AREA) &lt;&lt; endl; </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>C:&gt; setx -m OPENCV_DIR D:OpenCVBuildx64vc14</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select System info from the Administration panel."</p>
