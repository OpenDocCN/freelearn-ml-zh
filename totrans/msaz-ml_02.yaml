- en: While working on a predictive analysis model, you typically follow different
    steps, such as pulling data from one or more sources, exploring and preparing
    data, or applying different algorithms to get your desired output. Then, you test
    and improve on it. Usually, this is an iterative process. Once you are happy with
    your model, you find ways so that it can be deployed for production and other
    people or applications can consume or make use of your developed model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To perform the preceding tasks, you need an environment with the right tools
    available. ML Studio provides you with everything to develop and deploy a predictive
    model.

    a Microsoft account and a Azure ML workspace. Then, you will get introduced to
    different parts of ML Studio and learn how to create an experiment. You can also
    find out, briefly, how to work with other projects in ML Studio collaboratively.
    This chapter aims to familiarize you with the environment without doing any actual
    work, which is the content for the chapters following this one.

    iterate a predictive analysis model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You drag-and-drop datasets and analysis modules onto an interactive canvas,
    connecting them together to form an experiment, which you submit to ML Studio
    to run or execute. To iterate your model design, you edit the experiment, save
    a copy if desired, and submit it again.

- en: There is no programming required for this; visually connecting datasets and
    modules to construct your predictive analysis model is enough. However, if you
    need more functionality than what is available visually in ML Studio out of the
    box, you can write **R** or **Python** code to get the desired result. R or Python
    programming is not an absolute must to work with ML Studio.

    can be a simple one, such as a simple statistical analysis, or a complex predictive
    analysis. An experiment inside ML Studio is a collection of modules connected
    hierarchically. A module is a unit that encapsulates a machine learning library
    provided in ML Studio and performs a task common in machine learning scenarios.
    A dataset after it is uploaded to ML Studio is also available as a module to be
    used in an experiment. You just need to drag a module to the canvas of the experiment
    and visually join the output port of one to the input port of another to build
    the workflow for your model. A module may have one or more input ports or no input
    port at all. However, it must have at least one output port. You may think of
    a module as a block that may take inputs and generate a dataset per output port
    as output.
