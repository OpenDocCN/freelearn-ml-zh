- en: Building and training a **machine learning** (**ML**) model can be easy with
    SageMaker Studio. It is an **integrated development environment** (**IDE**) designed
    for ML developers for building and training ML models at scale and efficiently.
    In order to train an ML model, you may previously have dealt with the cumbersome
    overhead of managing compute infrastructure for yourself or for your team to train
    ML models properly. You may also have experienced compute resource constraints,
    either on desktop machines or with cloud resources, where you are given a fixed-size
    instance. When you develop in SageMaker Studio, there is no more frustration with
    provisioning and managing compute infrastructure because you can easily make use
    of elastic compute in SageMaker Studio and its wide support of sophisticated ML
    algorithms and frameworks for your ML use case.

    TensorFlow. Similar to how SageMaker supports TensorFlow, SageMaker has an estimator
    dedicated to PyTorch. You can access it with the `sagemaker.pytorch.PyTorch` class.
    The API's documentation is available at [https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/pytorch/sagemaker.pytorch.html](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/pytorch/sagemaker.pytorch.html).
    Follow *steps* *1-9* in the *TensorFlow* section to use your PyTorch training
    script, but instead of `framework_version`, you would specify the PyTorch version
    to access the specific SageMaker-managed PyTorch training container image.

- en: Hugging Face is an ML framework dedicated to natural language processing use
    cases. It helps you train complex NLP models easily with pre-built architecture
    and pre-trained models. It is compatible with both TensorFlow and PyTorch, so
    you can train with the framework that you are most familiar with. You can access
    the estimator with the `sagemaker.huggingface.HuggingFace` class. The API's documentation
    is available at [https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/sagemaker.huggingface.html](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/sagemaker.huggingface.html).
    Follow *steps* *1-9* in the *TensorFlow* section to use your scripts. The major
    difference compared with TensorFlow/PyTorch estimators is that there is an additional
    argument, `transformers_version`, for the `pytorch_version` or `tensorflow_version`
    instead of `framework_version`.

    SageMaker Studio. We ran two examples, one using SageMaker's built-in BlazingText
    algorithm to train a text classification model, and another one using TensorFlow
    as a deep learning framework to build a network architecture to train a sentiment
    analysis model to predict the sentiment in movie review data. We learned how SageMaker's
    fully managed training feature works and how to provision the right amount of
    compute resources from the SageMaker SDK for your training script.
