- en: Welcome! If you are interested in this book, you’re most likely familiar with
    Power BI, **machine learning** (**ML**), and OpenAI. Over the years, Power BI
    has evolved from a data visualization tool into a suite of user-friendly, end-to-end
    **software as a service** (**SaaS**) tools for data and analytics. I began writing
    this book with the goal of teaching Power BI professionals about the ML tool built
    into Power BI. Rather than write a technical manual, I decided to embrace the
    tradition of Microsoft’s popular *Power BI Dashboard in a Day* course (found at
    [https://aka.ms/diad](https://aka.ms/diad)) by writing the book as an end-to-end
    journey, starting with raw data and ending with ML, all within the SaaS Power
    BI toolset.

- en: During the course of writing the book, an amazing new technology arrived on
    the scene called OpenAI. OpenAI can generate and summarize human language in amazing
    ways. The use case for this book was a perfect fit for adding OpenAI as a capstone
    to the journey.

    the **Federal Aviation Authority** (**FAA**), reviewing requirements that mimic
    a real-world project, cleansing and curating the data using Power BI, making predictions
    using Power BI ML, and then integrating OpenAI into the use case. You can recreate
    the entire end-to-end solution by referencing the Packt GitHub site ([https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unleashing-Your-Data-with-Power-BI-Machine-Learning-and-OpenAI/](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unleashing-Your-Data-with-Power-BI-Machine-Learning-and-OpenAI/))
    as you read the book.

- en: '**Business Intelligence** (**BI**), ML, and OpenAI use data in different ways
    requiring different data modeling techniques and preparation. In my experience,
    most Power BI professionals think about data differently from ML and AI professionals.
    When BI professionals first branch into ML, these differences can cause ML projects
    to fail. Through the example of a real data story, this book attempts to teach
    those differences in the context of a use case with similar challenges and requirements
    to those that you may face in the real world. The overarching theme is the intersection
    of these skill sets for real-world projects that seamlessly incorporate BI, ML,
    AI, and OpenAI.'

- en: If you are looking for a technical manual about Power BI ML or OpenAI, this
    book is not for you. This book will walk you through a hero’s journey that builds
    up to ML and OpenAI as a capstone to the project. At the end of this book, beyond
    understanding how to use Power BI ML and OpenAI, you will understand how to *think
    about* and *understand* data projects in ways that can incorporate ML and OpenAI.
    Even if the tools in Power BI evolve to be different from the time this book was
    written, you should be able to apply these learned lessons to new tools and future
    challenges.

- en: I also want to briefly discuss SaaS ML tools in this preface. I’ve often heard
    experienced ML professionals urge caution with regard to SaaS ML tools. I agree
    that ML as a discipline requires a different mindset and unique skillset from
    many other data tools. Many factors can lead to ML models returning misleading
    or biased results. ML projects that need to be highly accurate, or that could
    have harmful outcomes when wrong, should be handled by ML professionals using
    advanced ML tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That being said, a SaaS tool such as Power BI ML still has a powerful place
    with the right audience. Power BI professionals interested in learning about ML
    can skill up quickly by using Power BI ML. Rapid feature discovery, simple predictive
    use cases, and ad hoc hypothesis testing can all be achieved with a low bar to
    entry using Power BI ML. The ML models you will build in this book are intended
    to spark your interest in the subject, not provide a comprehensive course on building
    proper ML models. By the end of this book, a Power BI professional will understand
    the basics of why they might use ML, how data needs to be modeled for ML, and
    how ML can be used in the workflow of a data project. Hopefully, some of you are
    inspired to learn more about ML and graduate to more advanced ML tools and courses.

    value to the hands-on workshop with the affiliated GitHub workshop. Real FAA data
    is used to generate new descriptions and summarize events in your Power BI solution.
    The intent of this book is not for you to become OpenAI or ML experts, but rather
    to understand the intersection of BI, ML, AI, and OpenAI. It is my belief that
    as enterprise SaaS tools such as Power BI become easier to use, the intersection
    of these skills and tools is the future of our profession.

    and OpenAI in the context of a hands-on workshop using real-world data. A working
    knowledge of Power BI prior to reading this book will be helpful. Taking the *Power
    BI Dashboard in a Day* training is a great place to start, even if you follow
    the PDF document from the link at your own pace. ML professionals may also find
    value in this book from the perspective of the intersection of BI, ML, OpenAI,
    and AI. I would expect an ML professional to have a more advanced understanding
    of BI projects and the Power BI toolset after reading this book.
