  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will cover the topic of feature engineering. A huge part of the data
    science and machine learning pipeline, feature engineering includes the ability
    to identify, clean, construct, and discover new characteristics of data for the
    purpose of interpretation and predictive analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we will be covering the entire process of feature engineering,
    from inspection to visualization, transformation, and beyond. We will be using
    both basic and advanced mathematical measures to transform our data into a form
    that's much more digestible by machines and machine learning pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By discovering and transforming, we, as data scientists, will be able to gain
    a whole new perspective on our data, enhancing not only our algorithms but also
    our insights.
