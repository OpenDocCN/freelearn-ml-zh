- en: Big data and artificial intelligence are ubiquitous part of our everyday lives,
    fostering a rising, billion-dollar, cloud-based **Machine Learning as a Service
    (MLaaS)** industry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Among the several Machine Learning as a Service platforms currently on the market,
    Amazon Machine Learning stands out for its simplicity. Amazon Machine Learning
    was launched in April 2015 with a clear goal of lowering the barrier to predictive
    analytic by offering a service accessible to companies without the need for highly
    skilled technical resources, while balancing performance and costs. When combined
    with the depth of the AWS ecosystem, the Amazon Machine Learning platform makes
    predictive analytics a natural element of the business data pipeline.

- en: 'This book follows the simplification approach of Amazon Machine Learning with
    two goals: to give you the core data science knowledge needed to use the service
    to its full potential and to give you the keys to building a fully featured data
    pipeline centered around predictive analytics, effectively making predictive analytics
    the driver of your data driven applications.'

    Learning and Predictive Analytics,* this introductory chapter is a general presentation
    of the Amazon Machine Learning service and the types of predictive analytics problems
    it can address. We show how the service uses a simple linear model for regression
    and classification problems, and we present the context for successful predictions
    with Amazon Machine Learning.'

    Definitions and Concepts,* this chapter explains the machine learning concepts
    needed to use the Amazon Machine Learning service and fully understand how it
    works. What are the preparation techniques used when dealing with raw data? How
    do we evaluate a predictive model? What strategies are available to remediate
    poor predictive performances?'

    Machine Learning Workflow,* this chapter is an overview of a simple Amazon Machine
    Learning project. The reader will learn how to get started on the Amazon Machine
    Learning platform, how to set up an account, and how to secure it. We go through
    a simple numeric prediction problem based on a classic dataset. We describe how
    to prepare the data, train and select a model, and make predictions.'

    the Dataset,* Amazon ML offers powerful features to transform the data through
    recipes. Working with a classic dataset, we upload data on S3, implement cross
    validation, create a schema, and examine available data statistics. We then extend
    Amazon ML feature engineering and data cleaning capabilities by using Athena,
    a recently launched AWS SQL service.'

    in this chapter, we explore the Amazon ML data transformations and how to apply
    them through recipes. We train and tune models and select the best ones by analyzing
    different prediction metrics. We present insights into the Stochastic Gradient
    Descent algorithm, and the use of different types of regularization. Finally,
    we analyze the training logs to better understand what goes on under the Amazon
    ML hood during model training.'

    we apply our newly trained models to make predictions on previously unseen data,
    and we make a final assessment of their performance and robustness. We show how
    to make batch predictions on a given dataset and how to set up a real-time endpoint
    for streaming predictions.'

    SDK,* using the AWS web interface to manage and run your projects is time-consuming.
    In this chapter, we move away from the web interface and start running our projects
    via the command line with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the Python
    SDK with the Boto3 library. We use our new powers to implement cross validation
    and recursive feature selection.'

    from Redshift*, in this chapter, we will use the power of SQL queries to address
    non-linear datasets. Creating datasources in Redshift gives us the potential for
    upstream SQL based feature engineering prior to datasource creation. We explore
    how to upload data from S3 to Redshift, access the database, run queries, and
    export results.'

    capabilities by integrating with other AWS services. We build a fully featured
    streaming data flow integrating AWS Kinesis, Lambda, Redshift, and Machine Learning
    to implement real time tweets classification.'
