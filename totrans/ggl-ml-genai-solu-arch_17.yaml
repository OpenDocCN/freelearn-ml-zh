- en: In this part, we begin our journey into the exciting universe of generative
    AI, which is currently taking the world by storm. This part of the book first
    introduces the fundamental concepts of generative AI, and we compare and contrast
    it against “traditional AI.” We then move on to cover more advanced topics and
    learn how to implement those concepts in Google Cloud. The final chapter of this
    part then focuses on bringing together the main concepts that we’ve learned throughout
    the book, and lays out instructions to build AI/ML and generative AI solutions
    using a combination of various Google Cloud products and services.
