- en: Hyperparameters are an important element in building useful machine learning
    models. This book curates numerous hyperparameter tuning methods for Python, one
    of the most popular coding languages for machine learning. Alongside in-depth
    explanations of how each method works, you will use a decision map that can help
    you identify the best tuning method for your requirements.

- en: 'We will start the book with an introduction to hyperparameter tuning and explain
    why it’s important. You’ll learn the best methods for hyperparameter tuning for
    a variety of use cases and a specific algorithm type. The book will not only cover
    the usual grid or random search but also other powerful underdog methods. Individual
    chapters are dedicated to giving full attention to the three main groups of hyperparameter
    tuning methods: exhaustive search, heuristic search, Bayesian optimization, and
    multi-fidelity optimization.'

    Hyperopt, Optuna, NNI, and DEAP to implement hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we
    will cover hyperparameters of popular algorithms and best practices that will
    help you efficiently tune your hyperparameters.

- en: The book is intended for data scientists and Machine Learning engineers who
    are working with Python and want to further boost their ML model’s performance
    by utilizing the appropriate hyperparameter tuning method. You will need to have
    a basic understanding of ML and how to code in Python but will require no prior
    knowledge of hyperparameter tuning in Python.
