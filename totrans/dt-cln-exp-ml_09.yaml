- en: The final ten chapters of this book introduce a wide range of machine learning
    algorithms, for predicting both continuous or categorical targets, or when there
    is no target. We explore models for continuous targets in this chapter.

- en: A persistent theme in these chapters is that finding the best possible model
    is partly about balancing variance and bias. When our models fit the training
    data too well, they may not be as generalizable as we need them to be. In cases
    like that, they may have low bias but high variance. For each algorithm we examine
    in these chapters, we discuss strategies for achieving this balance. These strategies
    range from regularization for linear regression and support vector regression
    models, to the value of k for k-nearest neighbors, to the maximum depth of decision
    trees.

- en: We also get a chance to practice the preprocessing, feature selection, and model
    evaluation strategies we worked with in [*Chapter 6*](B17978_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078)*,
    Preparing for Model Evaluation*. Each of the algorithms we discuss in this section
    requires different preprocessing for optimal results. For example, feature scaling
    is important for support vector regression, but not usually for a decision tree
    regression. We might use a polynomial transformation with a linear regression
    model, but that would also be unnecessary with a decision tree. We consider those
    choices in each chapter of this part.
