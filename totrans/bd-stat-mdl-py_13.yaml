- en: 'In this short chapter, we will introduce another branch of statistics called
    **survival analysis**, which is related to survival and time-censoring studies.
    Survival analysis is also called **time-to-event variable analysis**, which is
    a particular statistical outcome type that requires other techniques than those
    used in the few last chapters that we have studied. A time-to-event variable analysis
    studies, for example, whether a participant has an event of interest during the
    study timeframe. In other words, we study the *proportion of a sample surviving
    after a specific time point* and the rate at which the survived sample proportion
    will fail or die, or whether there are survival differences in different treatment
    groups. The term *survival* in survival analysis is originally based on the time
    from treatment until death in the medical field. However, survival analysis is
    readily applicable to many fields including engineering (where it is referred
    to as **reliability theory** or **reliability analysis**), sociology (**event
    history analysis**), and economics (**duration analysis**). Survival studies might
    not be ambiguous in medical research when a death occurs, although some events
    such as organ failure can be poorly defined. Ambiguity does occur in other research
    fields, however: for instance, in engineering, a failure or a broken system can
    be partial or not strictly determined by time. We also examine survival data,
    the survival function, hazard, and hazard ratios in this chapter.'

- en: In the field of statistics, **Censoring** refers to a situation where the full
    extent or precise value of a measurement or observation is not entirely known.
    In Survival Analysis, this happens when we have information about sample observations
    and do not know when the given event happened, and is considered a key issue in
    survival analysis, distinguishing time-to-event analysis from the other statistical
    analyses mentioned in the previous chapters. There are several reasons why censoring
    happens; for example, a person withdraws from a study or exits prior to a follow-up,
    or the event in question has already happened before the study starts. The censored
    event is *non-informative*, that is, *censoring causes study failure due to some
    reason other than failure time. In other words, failure caused by censoring is
    not related to the probability of an event occurring.* **Informative censoring**
    happens when an observation is lost to follow-up because of research reasons.
    Three types of informative censoring are **right censoring**, **left censoring**,
    and **interval censoring**. In this book, we focus on **non-informative** **right
    censoring**.

- en: When we know the *event has happened before the observation data is collected*,
    then the observation is **left-censored**. An example left-censored scenario is
    where we study the age when a middle-school student begins puberty. There may
    be some students reaching this developmental stage before they enter middle school.
    All of these students are considered left-censored. As another example, consider
    an HIV study for an at-risk group of patients where, by the time the study starts,
    some patients already have HIV.

- en: When the *event happens after some time point* but we do not know the exact
    time, then it is considered **right-censored**. Applying the previous scenario
    here, imagine there are some students who withdraw from the puberty developmental
    stage study, or we lose them prior to following up (for example, they move to
    another school) or they have a delayed puberty (the developmental stage had still
    not taken place by the time they left middle school to begin high school). Another
    example is a cancer study where a group of patients is recruited for a clinical
    trial to see how a new treatment affects them, but a patient in the group dies
    because of a car accident after 2 years. In that case, we know this patient’s
    survival is at least 2 years during the period of the study, but do not know how
    many years beyond 2 that this patient could have survived with the cancer diagnosis.

- en: Left censoring and right censoring are special cases of **interval censoring**.
    A clear example to illustrate interval censoring is a patient that tests negatively
    at time t 1 for HIV but positively at time t 2\. However, we do not know the exact
    time this patient got infected between time interval [t 1, t 2]. This particular
    patient had an annual checkup last year and again this year. The lab results show
    he was HIV-negative last year but HIV-positive this year. Therefore, the infection
    occurred at some time point between last year’s and this year’s checkups, but
    we do not know exactly when.

- en: 'There are two types of right censoring: **Type I censoring** and **Type II
    censoring**. In **Type I censoring**, a study is designed to terminate after some
    time point t. Fixed censoring occurs when an object does not have an event after
    time t. This object is considered censored at time t. Random censoring occurs
    when censored objects do not have the same censoring time. In **Type II censoring**,
    a study terminates after some prespecified number of events occur. This type of
    censoring is frequently used in life testing experiments to save time and money.
    For example, we randomly select n objects as a sample to test whether a new innovation
    is really effective, but instead of testing all these n objects, we define that
    the study terminates if r failures occur to save time and costs. In this case,
    the first r objects have events at time t 1, t 2, … , t r but the remaining n
    − r objects do not have an event at time T = max(t 1, t 2, … , t r) and they are
    therefore considered censored.'

    study but in year 5, he was still surviving. This patient has survived for more
    than 5 years, but we do not know for how many years he can ultimately survive,
    which means that right censoring occurred with this patient. The third patient
    was recruited in year 1 but she died in year 4\. The fourth patient joined the
    study in year 2 but by year 4, we were unable to follow up with this patient.
    The reason could be that he moved to another city, for instance. Censoring occurs
    for patient 2 and patient 4.

    was considered to have survived when the study concluded. This makes survival
    analysis different from regular statistical analyses. We also do not remove the
    data of the second patient from the study data since the information is valuable:
    patients can survive for at least 5 years. In addition, patient follow-ups can
    be prevented because they may move to another place or are very sick but instead
    of removing the data, we record the reason why they dropped out of the study.
    Similarly, gender considerations can be biased because, for example, male patients
    may be more likely to withdraw from the study than female patients when they are
    sick, thus resulting in a potentially incorrect conclusion that females survive
    longer than males.'

    an event. In addition, the follow-up time is also considered. *Time zero* or *time
    origin* is the time when the study starts. Depending on the purpose of a study,
    time zero or time origin can be different. For instance, in a prostate cancer
    study, researchers recruit 40-year-old and older male participants, but in a study
    of puberty developmental ages, male and female teenagers of 12 and older are recruited.
    If the research takes place over a period of time (which could be several months
