- en: OpenCV is one of the most popular libraries used to develop Computer Vision
    applications. It enables us to run many different Computer Vision algorithms in
    real time. It has been around for many years, and it has become the standard library
    in this field. One of the main advantages of OpenCV is that it is highly optimized
    and available on almost all the platforms.

- en: This book starts off by giving a brief introduction of various fields in Computer
    Vision and the associated OpenCV functionalities in C++. Each chapter contains
    real-world examples and code samples to demonstrate the use cases. This helps
    you to easily grasp the topics and understand how they can be applied in real
    life. To sum it up, this is a practical guide on how to use OpenCV in C++ and
    build various applications using this library.
