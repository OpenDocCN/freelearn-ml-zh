<p class="mce-root">Congratulations on reaching this point in the book! It has been an exciting journey for me, writing the various chapters and implementing the projects. I learned quite a lot as a result of undertaking this journey and I hope your experience has been the same.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Finally, here we are at the concluding chapter!</p>
<p class="mce-root">The year 2018 can be considered a boom year for data science, <strong class="calibre3">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="calibre3">ML</strong>), and <strong class="calibre3">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="calibre3">AI</strong>). Just look at the number of start-ups with the terms ML and AI in their tag lines, the focal points for acquisitions on the part of big companies, and the topics at the biggest tech conferences. It does not take a long time for us to realize that data, ML, and AI are omnipresent, and I believe that this trend is going to continue for a few years to come. More and more industries are going to utilize ML and AI in a big way. This essentially is going to create gaps in available talent in terms of implementing ML and AI in businesses. Therefore, this is the best time to invest in learning more and more in this area. AI and ML skills, combined with business skills, will be the most highly prized within the industry.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We also need to realize that the AI and ML space is evolving <span class="calibre4">rapidly – </span>new ML algorithms, new platforms, new infrastructure, and new types of data are just a few examples. To stay relevant, the only option is to keep ourselves updated with the newest trends and techniques out there. The other characteristics that are the most sought-after are unlearning the old and learning the new, and being flexible and modest enough to say, <em class="calibre15">it is okay that I don't know, but I am open to learning</em>.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Finally, what is the best way to learn and stay on top of things? Of course, there is no dearth of resources—<span class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre3">Massive Open Online Courses</strong> (</span><strong class="calibre3">MOOCs</strong>), books, blogs, conferences, seminars, classes, and so on. All that is needed is time and a willingness to learn. Happy learning in order to happily excel!</p>
