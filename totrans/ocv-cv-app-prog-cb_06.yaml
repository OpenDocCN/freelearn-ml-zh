- en: Filtering is one of the fundamental tasks in signal and image processing. It
    is a process aimed at selectively extracting certain aspects of an image that
    are considered to convey important information in the context of a given application.
    Filtering removes noise in images, extracts interesting visual features, allows
    image resampling, and so on. It finds its roots in the general **Signals and Systems**
    theory. We will not cover this theory in detail here. However, this chapter will
    present some of the important concepts related to filtering and will show you
    how filters can be used in image-processing applications. But first, let's begin
    with a brief explanation of the concept of frequency domain analysis.

- en: When we look at an image, we observe how the different gray-levels (or colors)
    are distributed over the image. Images differ from each other because they have
    a different gray-level distribution. However, there exists another point of view
    under which an image can be analyzed. We can look at the gray-level variations
    that are present in an image. Some images contain large areas of almost constant
    intensity (for example, a blue sky) while in other images, the gray-level intensities
    vary rapidly over the image (for example, a busy scene crowded with many small
    objects). Therefore, observing the frequency of these variations in an image constitutes
    another way of characterizing an image. This point of view is referred to as the
    **frequency domain**, while characterizing an image by observing its gray-level
    distribution is referred to as the **spatial domain**.

- en: The frequency domain analysis decomposes an image into its frequency content
    from the lowest to the highest frequencies. Areas where the image intensities
    vary slowly contain only low frequencies, while high frequencies are generated
    by rapid changes in intensities. Several well-known transformations exist, such
    as the Fourier transform or the Cosine transform, which can be used to explicitly
    show the frequency content of an image. Note that since an image is a two-dimensional
    entity, it is made of both vertical frequencies (variations in the vertical directions)
    and horizontal frequencies (variations in the horizontal directions).

    that amplifies certain bands of frequencies of an image while blocking (or reducing)
    other image frequency bands. A low-pass filter is, therefore, a filter that eliminates
    the high-frequency components of an image and reciprocally, a high-pass filter
    eliminates the low-pass components. This chapter will present some filters that
    are frequently used in image processing and will explain their effect when applied
    on an image.

    introductory section of this chapter, we learned that the objective of such filters
    is to reduce the amplitude of the image variations. One simple way to achieve
    this goal is to replace each pixel by the average value of the pixels around it.
    By doing this, the rapid intensity variations will be smoothed out and thus replaced
    by a more gradual transition.

    filter on the image lines first (to filter the horizontal frequencies), followed
    by the application of another 1D Gaussian filter on the image columns (to filter
    the vertical frequencies). This is possible because the Gaussian filter is a separable
    filter (that is, the 2D kernel can be decomposed into two 1D filters). The `cv::sepFilter2D`
    function can be used to apply a general separable filter. It is also possible
    to directly apply a 2D kernel using the `cv::filter2D` function. In general, separable
    filters are faster to compute than non-separable ones because they require less
    multiplication operations.

    both the number of coefficients (the third parameter, which is an odd number)
    and the value of σ (the fourth parameter) to `cv::GaussianBlur`. You can also
    simply set the value of σ and let OpenCV determine the appropriate number of coefficients
    (you then input a value of `0` for the filter size). The opposite is also possible,
    where you input a size and a value of `0` for σ. The σ value that best fits the
    given size will be determined.

    reducing it by a factor of two. The reciprocal `cv::pyrUp` function that doubles
    the size of an image also exists. It is interesting to note that in this case,
    the upsampling is done by inserting the `0` values between every two columns and
    rows and then by applying the same `5x5` Gaussian filter (but with the coefficients
    multiplied by `4`) on the expanded image. Obviously, if you downsize an image
    and then upsize it, you will not recover the exact original image. What was lost
    during the downsizing process cannot be recovered. These two functions are used
    to create **image pyramids**. This is a data structure made of stacked versions
    of an image at different sizes (here, each level is 2 times smaller than the previous
    level, but the reduction factor can be less, for example, `1.2`) that is often
    built for efficient image analysis. For example, if you want to detect an object
    in an image, the detection can be first accomplished on the small image at the
    top of the pyramid, and as you locate the object of interest, you can refine the
    search by moving to the lower levels of the pyramid that contains the higher resolution

    some pixel interpolation in order to produce new pixel values at locations that

    strategy**. The new grid of pixels that must be produced is placed on top of the
    existing image, and each new pixel is assigned the value of its closest pixel
    in the original image. In the case of image upsampling (that is, when using a
    new grid denser than the original one), this implies that more than one pixel
    of the new grid will receive its value from the same original pixel.

    characters, a signed integer, or a floating point image. Of course, if the result
    falls outside of the domain of the image pixel, saturation will be applied. This
    is where the last two parameters can be useful. Before storing the result in the
    image, the result can be scaled (multiplied) by `alpha` and an offset, `beta`,
    can be added. This is how, in the previous section, we generated an image for
    which the Sobel value `0` was represented by the mid-gray level `128`. Each Sobel
    mask corresponds to a derivative in one direction. Therefore, two parameters are
    used to specify the kernel that will be applied, the order of the derivative in
    the `x`, and the `y` directions. For instance, the horizontal Sobel kernel is
    obtained by specifying `1` and `0` for the `xorder` and `yorder` parameters, and
    the vertical kernel will be generated with `0` and `1`. Other combinations are
    also possible, but these two are the ones that will be used most often (the case
    of second-order derivatives is discussed in the next recipe). Finally, it is also
    possible to use kernels of a size that is larger than `3x3`. Values `1`, `3`,
    `5`, and `7` are possible choices for the kernel size. A kernel of size 1 corresponds
    to a 1D Sobel filter (`1x3` or `3x1`). See the following *There's more…* section

    of these higher frequency elements, it is a good practice to first smooth the
    image before applying a derivative filter. You might think that this would be
    done in two steps, which are smoothing the image and then computing the derivative.
    However, a closer look at these operations reveals that it is possible to combine
    these two steps into one with a proper choice of the smoothing kernel. We learned
    previously that the convolution of an image with a filter can be expressed as
    a summation of terms. Interestingly, a well-known mathematical property is that

    larger kernels, and since this operator is even more sensitive to image noise,
    it is desirable to do so (unless computational efficiency is a concern). Since
    these larger kernels are computed using the second derivatives of the Gaussian
    function, the corresponding operator is often called **Laplacian of Gaussian**
    (**LoG**). Note that the kernel values of a Laplacian always sum up to `0`. This
    guarantees that the Laplacian will be zero in areas of constant intensities. Indeed,
    since the Laplacian measures the curvature of the image function, it should be
    equal to `0` on flat areas.

- en: 'At first glance, the effect of the Laplacian might be difficult to interpret.
    From the definition of the kernel, it is clear that any isolated pixel value (that
    is, a value that''s very different from its neighbors) will be amplified by the
    operator. This is a consequence of the operator''s high sensitivity to noise.
    However, it is more interesting to look at the Laplacian values around an image
    edge. The presence of an edge in an image is the result of a rapid transition
    between areas of different gray-level intensities. Following the evolution of
    the image function along an edge (for example, caused by a transition from dark
    to bright), one can observe that the gray-level ascension necessarily implies
    a gradual transition from a positive curvature (when the intensity values start
    to rise) to a negative curvature (when the intensity is about to reach its high
    plateau). Consequently, a transition between a positive and a negative Laplacian
    value (or reciprocally) constitutes a good indicator of the presence of an edge.
    Another way to express this fact is to say that edges will be located at the **zero-crossings**
    of the Laplacian function. We will illustrate this idea by looking at the values
    of a Laplacian in a small window of our test image. We select one that corresponds
    to an edge created by the bottom part of the roof of one of the castle''s tower.

    is made between strong edges and weaker edges. We also mentioned that the Laplacian
    is very sensitive to noise. Finally, some of these edges are due to compression
    artifacts. All these factors explain why so many edges are detected by the operator.
    In practice, the Laplacian is only used in conjunction with other operators to
    detect edges (for example, edges can be declared at zero-crossing locations of
    strong gradient magnitude). We will also learn in [Chapter 8](part0058_split_000.html#page
    "Chapter 8. Detecting Interest Points"), *Detecting Interest Points*, that the
    Laplacian and other second-order operators are very useful in order to detect
    interest points at multiple scales.

    a combination of low-pass filters. But before that, let's have a word about image
    enhancement, which is a topic we already discussed in [Chapter 2](part0019_split_000.html#page

    the low frequencies of an image. We learned that the range of frequencies that
    are filtered by a Gaussian filter depend on the parameter σ, which controls the
    width of the filter. Now, if we subtract the two images that result from the filtering
    of an image by two Gaussian filters of different bandwidths, then the resulting
    image will be composed of those higher frequencies that one filter has preserved,
    and not the other. This operation is called **Difference of Gaussians** (**DoG**)

- en: In fact, it can be demonstrated that with the proper choice of σ values, DoG
    operators can constitute a good approximation of LoG filters. Also, if you compute
    a series of difference of Gaussians from consecutive pair values in an increasing
    sequence of σ values, you obtain a scale-space representation of the image. This
    multiscale representation is useful, for example, for scale-invariant image feature
    detection, as it will be explained in [Chapter 8](part0058_split_000.html#page
    "Chapter 8. Detecting Interest Points"), *Detecting Interest Points*.

  zh: 实际上，可以证明，通过适当选择σ值，DoG算子可以构成LoG滤波器的一个良好近似。此外，如果你从σ值递增序列的连续对值中计算一系列高斯差分，你将获得图像的尺度空间表示。这种多尺度表示很有用，例如，对于尺度不变图像特征检测，正如将在[第8章](part0058_split_000.html#page
