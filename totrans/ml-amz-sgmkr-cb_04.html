			<h1 id="_idParaDest-72"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Chapter 3</em>: Understanding and Defining Business Problems</h1>
			<p>This chapter covers topics that are the most critical for success and yet are not discussed in detail in data science programs or books. Although the topic of understanding and defining business problems is mentioned very briefly as something that should be done, it is very rare that the discussion will go into how to actually do it properly. In this chapter, we will go into specific tools and methods that can be used to gain an understanding of the system under consideration and determine the problem that needs to be solved. </p>
			<p>This section is independent of DataRobot, as DataRobot cannot help you with this part of the process. This is something that a data analyst, a business analyst, or a data scientist has to do. Correctly defining a business problem is hard to do—it is not automatable, and it is also not done properly most of the time. If you gain this skill, you will become invaluable. This is a key area where there will always be a need for experienced data scientists (or whatever they are called in the future). </p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about some of the core concepts and methods you need to know in order to ensure that you are solving the right problems. The rest of the book will explain how to solve those problems in the right way. </p>
			<p>In the chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the system context</li>
				<li>Understanding the <em class="italic">why</em> and the <em class="italic">how</em></li>
				<li>Getting to the root of the business problem</li>
				<li>Defining the <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) problem</li>
				<li>Determining predictions, actions, and consequences for Responsible <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>)</li>
				<li>Operationalizing and generating value</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Understanding the system context</h1>
			<p>All<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> problems arise within the context of a system. A <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>system could be a single cell of an organism, a global population, or the entire economy. In the same way, all solutions need to fit into a system. A technological solution (for example, an AI solution) will typically require changes to processes, people, skills, other IT systems, or even the business model for it to be effective. For an organization, the system could be its entire supply chain, competitors, and customers. Given that a system's definition can be very broad, it is generally advisable that you imagine a system to be broader than the problems you are considering. You want all the components or agents that your problem touches to be part of the system context. Defining the system boundary is part art and part science, and it is an iterative process. Given that you will be looking at the system from a broader perspective, this also means that the same system context will be valid for multiple ML projects or use cases. The understanding you gain here will pay dividends across many projects.</p>
			<p>Data scientists or analysts who might have worked in an organization or industry would have intuitively learned many of the systemic aspects of the problem. They might feel that they do not need to look into this further as they already understand key issues. While that might be true, it is also true that people develop blind spots and start to overlook key missing pieces or carry implicit assumptions that are mostly correct but sometimes wrong. Using structured methods to capture systemic understanding helps overcome these problems and also ensures that everyone is working from a common understanding. These issues are typically ones leading to problems or delays in projects downstream. Let's look at how we build this understanding by creating a context diagram.</p>
			<p>A context diagram<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> is a high-level view of your system, showing key players and their interactions, as illustrated here: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_01.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Context diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Context diagram</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>specific diagramming convention is not that important; what is more important is that you understand and document the components and understand how they interact. There are many diagramming conventions out there, so feel free to use the one you like. Make sure to capture three to five important instances of each topic in the diagram. The arrows need not be one-way. </p>
			<p>As you look at this simple diagram, you will agree that we should know all of these things. As you try to build this diagram, you might be shocked to learn that finding and capturing this information is not that straightforward. Most people in an organization will have some notion of these things but might not be able to precisely specify the most important customers <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>or <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>), and so on. In most organizations, it might take some time and discussion to put this together. Most of the components in the diagram are easy to understand but some are a bit confusing, so it's worth discussing them a little bit, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key objectives</strong>: Key objectives <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>are measurable metrics that let you determine whether you are achieving your goals in a timely fashion. These typically take the form of financial performance, market share, customer satisfaction, reputation, quality levels, and compliance. It is important to have precise and measurable definitions and alignment with the goals of the organization. These represent true value to an organization, and it is important to understand how your projects and models impact these.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">External drivers/risks</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>external factors or drivers that impact the key objectives but are not under your control. Notice that we are not discussing specific events, but changes in value of factors that might be considered events—for example, the factor <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>might be <strong class="bold">gross domestic product</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDP</strong>) change. It is not in our control, and a value of -20% might indicate a financial crash. So, our driver in this case is GDP change as opposed to financial crash.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key decision levers</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> also drivers that impact key objectives, but they are in our control. For example, the number of employees is a factor that is in our control (as we can decide how many to hire) and it will have an impact on outcomes. Other examples could be how much to invest in new technology or in marketing, and so on. These could be strategic decisions or choices, such as creating a new distribution channel, bundling products, and so on. Regardless of type, the important thing to remember is to make sure that the idea is captured in a precise way—for example, if a new distribution channel is a driver, you should know what the five actual choices are.<p class="callout-heading">Note of caution</p><p class="callout">Please do not get trapped in philosophical debates. Quickly create the first iteration of your diagram and refine it in the future, as needed. It is OK to move forward with the first draft, as your analysis might inform and change the current thinking.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you may have guessed by now, the reason for highlighting these three items is that historic data about them will be critical for any data science project. You will also agree that data about these factors is critical for operational as well as strategic decisions, yet you might find that this data might not be easily available or might have quality issues. In addition, pay special attention to key knowledge stores. These will be the databases, data warehouses, data lakes, or filesystems that contain data for your organization. We will revisit these items again in the following sections. </p>
			<p>Now that we understand the context, we want to understand how our system operates and why it behaves a certain way. Both of these aspects are critical to understanding the system. In the next section, we will describe how to create that understanding.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Understanding the why and the how</h1>
			<p>The key to understanding a <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>system's function and its behavior lies in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> aspects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process</strong>: How do objects and information flow through the system's processes?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Interaction</strong>: How do different entities or components of the system interact with each other?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">State</strong>: How does the state of an entity evolve over time?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Causal</strong>: What are the causal relationships?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these aspects is <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>represented via diagrams. There are many diagramming conventions for process modeling, causal modeling, and interaction diagrams. These conventions are used differently in different domains. You can follow any of the conventions that you like or are already familiar with. In this book, we will follow certain conventions that are amenable to computational modeling. What that means is that these diagrams can be combined with data and turned into models that can be used for analysis. This will become important in the later stages of our project. In-depth details of how to create these diagrams and turn them into computational models are beyond the scope of this book, but if you are interested you can seek out other sources to learn about these techniques. Even if you do not create computational models, these diagrams will provide useful insights that you will be able to use in your ML projects. It is possible that you have people in your organization that build—or have built—such diagrams. You should seek those people out and elicit their help in building these diagrams. Let's look at each of these aspects in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Process diagrams</h2>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>an organization's operation, there are several functions that have well-defined processes. Objects, people, or information flow through these processes, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer054" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_02.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Process diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Process diagram</p>
			<p>Based on the system context, you already know the most important processes in an organization. You can start building diagrams for these key processes—or at the very least, the one that is relevant to your project. It is important to build end-to-end process flows—for example, the entire customer journey, or the entire development process for a product. It is also important to understand the process from a customer's viewpoint (gray boxes) and not just internal processes (white boxes). Make sure to capture failure points or rework paths, or where a process might end abruptly instead of normal completion. As entities flow through these processes, decisions or computations are made that could be candidate ML problems. Regardless of the project you are starting from, it is a good idea to identify other potential opportunities along the way. It may turn out that looking at the process differently or building a different ML model could provide larger benefit or might preempt a need for the current project. Whether or not that turns out to be the case, it is important to capture this information. By the way, did you notice in the preceding process diagram that the customer is not receiving a reject message? As you can imagine, this is an important part of the customer experience that is being left out. I am sure that error will be caught at some point, but making the process explicit increases the odds of catching it sooner and taking it into account as you are building your models.</p>
			<p>Besides building the<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> diagram, it is important to capture data about the process. You will frequently run into situations where someone has already built a process diagram but did not capture any data. If you are reading this book, then I do not need to tell you how important collecting that data is for accurately understanding the process. Typical information to be captured is counts and types of objects flowing through each step, time taken at each step, labor hours and resources required at each step, probability of taking a specific path, quality metrics, and so on. If such information is not being captured for key processes, then it is important to start collecting this information as soon as possible. This information could be critical for building a business case for your project, serving as useful features in the model, and helping identify problems that might be otherwise hidden. </p>
			<p>It is important to note again that you do not want to get stuck in terminology debates, and instead quickly create a diagram that is sufficient to help you understand what happens in the process, as opposed to a very detailed view with every little nuance in it. It is OK to revisit this if a need arises to get into more details on some specific aspect of the process.</p>
			<p>Actual processes are typically a little more complex than what we show in <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em> but not by much, and it is not uncommon to uncover things that are not known to many people outside the specific department where these tasks are done. In my experience, it is also not uncommon to find that no single person understands the entire process. The exercise can be valuable in itself by highlighting key problems but it is especially valuable to the data science team building models to automate some part of this process, yet I am surprised to see how many times data science teams build models without understanding the process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Interaction diagrams</h2>
			<p>There are many<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> interactions happening in a system that do not follow a fixed process. These interactions can happen in different orders and need to be kept flexible, and are best understood via interaction diagrams. Those of you with software development backgrounds are likely familiar with such diagrams that show interactions among software components or objects. In our case, we are interested in understanding interactions between key players in a system, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer055" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_03.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Interaction diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Interaction diagram</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>diagram shows a marketplace where several competitors are selling their products. Customers come to this marketplace to purchase the products. The competitors spend money to advertise their products on various media channels, and set their prices. The consumers are influenced by the advertising, pricing, and word of mouth from other consumers. At any given time, many of these interactions are taking place, creating a complex and dynamic environment. If you are building a pricing model you have to take all of this into account, or your model will show great statistical fit to data but will prove ineffective during operation.</p>
			<p>Note that key players can be people, organizations, bots, marketplaces, fraudsters, and so on. The idea behind building this and other diagrams is to codify and make explicit what you know. This enables everyone to share a common view of the system and question assumptions or point out missing information. It is also important to make sure that you treat these diagrams as hypotheses that need to be tested with data. You have to continually ask whether the data supports what we are saying in these diagrams. If not, then maybe your assumptions need to be refined, or perhaps you have missing data or other data-quality problems. Perhaps the data collection is biased. I am sure you have heard stories about how biased data was used to make predictions that turned out to be totally wrong. Building a diagram is not a guarantee that you will catch biased data, but it does improve your odds of catching it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>State diagrams</h2>
			<p>A state diagram<a id="_idIndexMarker187"/> captures the evolution of state of some important entity or actor in a system. Typical candidates are customers and products. As with other diagrams, you build these diagrams for only the important or critical actors in a system. </p>
			<p>An example state diagram can be seen here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_04.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – State diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – State diagram</p>
			<p>State diagrams are very similar in <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>concept to <strong class="bold">Markov chains</strong> (this concept represents the probability of transitioning a system from one state to another state in such a way that the probability is fixed and not dependent on any previous history), except in a state diagram you do not have to assume that history does not matter. A state diagram is built for a specific agent. <em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em> shows a state diagram of a person progressing through various states over time. The arrows represent transitions from one state to another, and the person stays in a given state until they transition to the next state. The transition is typically assumed to be instantaneous. You can also think of the transitions in terms of transition probabilities (in which case, it starts resembling a Markov chain). The diagrams can be hierarchical in the sense that a state can be decomposed into sub-states, and those sub-states can be interconnected via transitions. </p>
			<p>In addition to building a diagram, you want to understand what causes a transition to take place. Is it deterministic or is it random? You also want to collect data about how often and when these transitions take place as this data is very useful for further analysis, as well as for building ML models. Transitions of one actor might cause a transition in another actor's state, thus state diagrams are also connected to interaction diagrams. Each of the transitions is a potential candidate for an ML model, where you can use data to predict when a transition (and which one) might fire. As you can imagine, building these diagrams will lead to the identification of opportunities that might otherwise be missed.</p>
			<p>Using these <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>diagrams, you now have an understanding of how a system functions. We are now ready to look at what determines a system's behavior.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Causal diagrams</h2>
			<p>Causal diagrams<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> intend to capture our understanding of cause-and-effect relationships present in a system. This understanding may or may not be correct. In fact, you might never be able to prove causation. Philosophical debates aside, you can greatly improve your understanding by using the methods outlined in this section, combined with data.</p>
			<p>An example causal diagram can be seen here: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_05.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Causal diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Causal diagram</p>
			<p>The preceding diagram shows the relationships in a housing market (this is just an example—it doesn't show all the causal influences). It says that as interest rates go up, home sales decline. Home sales are also influenced by demand and prices. As prices go up, the rising prices can increase demand as more people want to buy homes to make money, but the price itself is a deterrent. You can see that there are opposing effects and feedback loops present in this simple diagram. No wonder the dynamics confound us, and this frequently leads to the system going haywire. Everyone thinks they understand how the housing market works, but real understanding is difficult to achieve in the presence of complex dynamics. Similar dynamics are at play in many business situations. It is easy to build an ML model to predict home prices, but it is much harder to understand the overall dynamics. This lack of understanding can lead to a situation where you are using excellent ML models to make bad decisions, hence building such models is critical for understanding the true nature of the problem you are trying to solve. Such diagrams are also useful for understanding and treating confounding variables and counterfactual analysis [Pearl].</p>
			<p>There is one more<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> representation of causal models that comes from the discipline of system dynamics. This representation combines some ideas from the other diagrams with causal diagrams to create a view that can be very insightful and can be easily turned into a dynamic simulation model. System dynamics is a vast discipline in itself, and there are many good books and papers on the topic [Sterman]. Here, I will only introduce the notion and what it looks like, and how it can be useful. Here is an example system dynamics (also known as stock and flow) diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_06.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – System dynamics (stock and flow) diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – System dynamics (stock and flow) diagram</p>
			<p>This diagram captures ideas from a state diagram, a process diagram, and a causal diagram into a composite view that can be very instructive. Imagine the journey of a product as it changes state, going from a <em class="italic">raw product</em> to a <em class="italic">shipped product</em>. Each box in this case represents the quantity of a product in a specific state—for example, the <strong class="bold">Assembled Product</strong> box represents all products that have been assembled and are now waiting to become <em class="italic">finished products</em>. This happens at a rate called the <em class="italic">finish rate</em>. The finish rate is dependent on how many assemblers are available to perform the work. You will also notice that some assembled products turn out to be defective. These products flow into the <strong class="bold">Defective Product</strong> box at a rate called the <em class="italic">defect rate</em>. These then have to be repaired by repairers. Because of defects, the shipping target is not met and there is a shortfall. This shortfall increases pressure on the employees, which increases burnout. The burnout in turn reduces the number of assemblers (they quit or get sick). Since the number of assemblers is reduced, this slows down the finish rate. This in turn increases the pressure and more people are shifted to become repairers, as repairs can be done faster. This leaves no one working as preventers and causes the vicious cycle to continue, with the process becoming more and more backlogged. </p>
			<p>This dynamic plays<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> out in many organizations and they wonder why they are always under pressure. Once the diagram is laid out, you can see the problem is that they are fixing symptoms as opposed to the root problem of defects. In this simple diagram it is easy to see, but in more complex situations you can run simulations of these diagrams to find the problem points. The diagram also helps to clarify the relationship between the processes, decisions, and business objectives. These diagrams can be simulated to understand the business impacts of decisions, as well as the impacts of deploying ML models. This is a great way to show the value of your efforts in a way that most people can easily understand.</p>
			<p>Now, let's come back to ML. If this analysis is not done, then it is most likely that defect repair will get flagged as a problem, and it is likely you will be building a model to predict how many defects will be created or predict how many items will be shipped. You will build a great model, but that will not solve the problem. The key problem is to find which factors are causing the defects and how the defects can be reduced. This will require the manufacturing team to work closely with the data science team to find a solution. Again, the key point is that unless someone does this analysis, the data science team is likely to be solving the wrong problem. You might think that this doesn't happen often, but I contend that this happens a lot more than you might think because the true problem often stays hidden for a long time.</p>
			<p>In general, it is best to treat each causal relationship you have drawn in these diagrams as a hypothesis. The diagram then represents a collection of hypotheses. There are statistical and simulation methods that can be used to validate these hypotheses. For this, you will need to start collecting data or start discovering where that data is stored. Now that we have learned about these diagrams, let's look at how we get to the root of the problem.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Getting to the root of the business problem</h1>
			<p>Some <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>problems are easy to solve, while others prove to be much harder. One of the reasons this happens is that when a problem's symptoms appear somewhere else and after some delay, then it is very difficult to know where the problem really is. By definition, the symptoms are clearly visible—they are explicit and you can easily collect data about them. The underlying problem, on the other hand, is happening in some other department or building and is not visible because it is not causing immediate pain. Most likely, no data is being collected about the root problem, or it might be too hard to collect that data. Given the nature of ML, it is almost a given that all the data you are getting is about symptoms. If you are lucky, you might get some data about the root problem as well (although you will not know it). </p>
			<p>One of the ways to get started is by using an old method called <em class="italic">five whys</em>, which basically involves asking the question <em class="italic">Why?</em> five times to get to the root cause. Many times, there might be multiple causes at each level. So, in practical terms, many people use another diagram that is called a <em class="italic">fishbone diagram</em> to<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> capture this information, as illustrated here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_07.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – Fishbone diagram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Fishbone diagram</p>
			<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>fishbone example diagram, we are trying to understand why we have a software defect problem. As you ask <em class="italic">why</em> questions and capture the causes, you begin to add potential causes. You continue this process until you feel that you have captured the essence of the problem. As you can tell, this is partly a causal diagram and can be used as a starting point for building a causal model for your system while maintaining focus on a specific problem. Data can then be collected to confirm or reject the hypotheses. As<a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> you can see, this fishbone diagram will inform the system dynamics diagram we saw in <em class="italic">Figure 3.6</em>. The key point of the exercise is to understand the root cause and work on fixing this. I hope you are beginning to see that accurately predicting something is not always the same as fixing the real problem, and you have to be a bit careful about setting up your ML problem for your project to be successful. Also, notice that there might be multiple causes leading up to a problem and you might have to address multiple issues in order to see significant mitigation of the problem. On the other hand, addressing only one aspect (say, employee burnout) without understanding the full picture could lead you to conclude that burnout is not a problem. It is not uncommon in organizations to have reached wrong conclusions that then get incorporated into the myths of the organization—"<em class="italic">we already tried that, and it does not work.</em>"</p>
			<p>Now that we have identified the business problem that needs to be tackled, let's look at how we turn it into an ML problem.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Defining the ML problem</h1>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>we get into the details of ML, it is important to note that not all problems are appropriate to be solved with ML. For a problem to be a good candidate, it should have the following characteristics (we will focus only on <strong class="bold">supervised learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">SL</strong>) problems for now):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There is a clear target or label value that would be useful if an algorithm can predict it. In the absence of an algorithm this value remains unknown, requires a person's judgment, or requires substantial effort for it to be determined. Sometimes, the target will not be the actual variable of interest but a critical component of that calculation. This part is not always obvious, but the problem analysis you did in previous sections of this chapter will certainly help in clarifying which variable makes the best target.</li>
				<li>You have access to a large enough historical dataset that contains the values of the target or label you wish to predict. You will need to create a list of data sources that contain relevant data and start understanding the data that they contain.</li>
				<li>Determine which type of SL problem is best suited to your problem (regression, classification, or time series). Sometimes, you can cast one type of problem into another type.</li>
				<li>There is typically a trade-off between accuracy, explainability, and understandability. It is important for you to consider what is more important for your business problem. In many situations, we are willing to sacrifice accuracy to improve understandability. This, in turn, determines which algorithms and which explanatory method you should select.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will have to<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> review your datasets and the business problem definition to see whether you can craft a specification such that the conditions listed previously are satisfied. In doing so, there are several transformations that might have to be performed, such as these:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Transform the target such that it is more valuable as an output or better suited to solve the business problem. Take the following examples:<p>(a) If numeric target values are over a very large range of values or are distributed with a high skew, then you can try to log the target as a new target.</p><p>(b) If the actual value is less important than a range, then you can create bins and use the binned values as targets.</p><p>(c) Sometimes, a change in value or the rate of change makes for a better target.</p></li>
				<li>Create interaction features based on the causal diagrams. Take the following examples:<p>(a) Intermediate variables in the causal model that are not directly observed but can be computed by combining various other features.</p><p>(b) If your target is in log form, then it might make sense to create logs of various features.</p><p>(c) Similarly, you might want to bin certain features if the bins have a special significance in the business problem.</p><p>(d) Explore whether creating rate-of-change features would be important for your model.</p></li>
				<li>Identify <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>missing data that showed up in the causal diagram but is not present in your dataset. Depending on the importance and how easy it is to get this, you might want to collect it before building the model. Another choice is to get the data collection process started in parallel with building the model with the data you already have. In the latter case, you can always revisit the model in the next iteration when you have collected the data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, you also have to think about how you will define and assess errors. Which metric will be best for the problem? We covered metrics in <a href="B17159_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Machine Learning Basics</em>, and DataRobot automatically picks an appropriate metric for the problem. I have found the selections to be very good most of the time, so it is a good idea to go with the recommendation unless you have a good reason not to. In addition to metrics, you need to think about whether you care more about errors in a specific range versus some other range—for example, maybe you want to be more accurate in the high-value range of a feature versus the low-value range. In such cases, you can consider using this numeric feature (this has to be a non-target feature) as a weight for computing the error metrics.

			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> preceding screenshot shows the options for selecting a feature to be used as a weighting for the predictions. Note that this has to be set at the start of a project. Once the model building starts, you cannot change this setting.</p>
			<p>Once you have the ML problem defined, DataRobot comes into action to build the models. We will cover this in later chapters. For now, we want to discuss what happens when the models are built and are now able to generate predictions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Determining predictions, actions, and consequences for Responsible AI</h1>
			<p>After the<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> model is built and deployed in DataRobot, it <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>might seem that our job is done—but not so<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> fast. You should start analyzing what the predictions profile looks like and start discussing with users and stakeholders the details of actions to be taken. The models you have helped build are likely to introduce many changes in your system and will impact other people. It is therefore important to try to make sure that these impacts are not negative. Making sure that your models will not cause harm is called Responsible AI. This will build upon the work you did during the understanding phase through various diagrams.</p>
			<p>Just as in previous sections we saw how a causal diagram helps you to relate features to a target, we can also see how the target affects other parts of the system. The diagram should reveal how the target impacts key objectives or outcomes; it should also reveal key feedback loops that will change the behavior of the rest of the system, as well as giving a hint of other consequences. This makes it relatively straightforward to understand and compute the <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) from your model. A common challenge expressed by data science <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>teams is that they find it hard to express the impacts of a model. As you can now see, the work we put into understanding our system from a causal perspective also helps to determine the business impact of the model.</p>
			<p>It is very common to see that most systems don't provide a free lunch—there are always trade-offs. Your actions might improve one objective but might hurt another. It is very important to understand these trade-offs and to ensure that your stakeholders understand them as well. It is very possible that even though the model will provide a positive ROI, it might cause performance to degrade in other areas, such that you might not want to go forward with it. Some of these consequences could be in the areas of regulatory or ethical issues. These areas are often overlooked, only to be discovered (painfully) at a later point in time. One of the key benefits of doing this analysis is to make sure you are catching any problems earlier.</p>
			<p>Another mechanism that is often used is to simulate the system dynamics diagrams. This allows you to understand the dynamic behavior of your system and can serve as a virtual experiment. Virtual experiments or simulations let you test out different strategies in a safe environment before launching your models. Not only does this help you avoid costly mistakes—it can often also suggest improvements or strategies to further optimize the benefits. The reasons many data science projects do not succeed are that data science teams rarely do this, typically do not have the skills to do this analysis, and have historically not taken <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>this part very seriously. Let's look here at a simple example of <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>an ML model <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>in a system:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17159_03_09.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Impact analysis&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Impact analysis</p>
			<p>In this example, you have a price promotion model that uses some features to generate a promotion price. This model monitors the sales and updates the price accordingly. For some reason (database updates, approvals, and so on), there is a delay involved in updating these prices on the e-commerce site. This creates a lag in the sales data that is not known to the modeling team because the modeling team did not understand the entire flow and how much time it takes to update prices on the site. If you were to do an analysis of this simple diagram, you would discover that such feedback loops with delays produce oscillating behavior. This means that the pricing will always be off—sometimes higher and sometimes lower. This behavior is somewhat similar to what you see in most model results anyway, so it is entirely possible that this effect will be missed. The system will perform poorly even though the model itself was fine. I have kept this example very simple to make a point. You can imagine that if the situation were more complex, most people would not be able to see the problem on their own till it is too late. </p>
			<p>On the flip side, you can also evaluate how much sales impact your model will make compared to the status quo. This is a great way to show ROI and the business value of your work. Since simulations based on these diagrams are a visual representation of your business, most people find it a lot easier to understand as compared to narratives or spreadsheets. This also helps in gaining acceptance of your ML models.</p>
			<p>While<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> DataRobot does not help with many of these aspects, it <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>does offer mechanisms to determine whether your<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> model is biased along with any protected features and measure the amount of bias that exists in the model. This, combined with the preceding analysis, can go a long way to ensure that your models are not biased and that the results are not being used in a way that goes against your organization's values. Now that we are happy with the model's expected results, we can start the process of deployment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Operationalizing and generating value</h1>
			<p>Operationalizing <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>a model in your infrastructure can be a complicated <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>undertaking. There are some aspects of deployment that are made simple by DataRobot, but there are other parts of deployment that are outside the scope of DataRobot and can be quite challenging. Let's discuss the tasks that are part of this process, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deploying a model as an application programming interface (API)</strong>: One of the very first tasks is to deploy your model as an API so that it can serve predictions as needed. You will have to decide whether this needs to be a batch or real-time operation. DataRobot automates much of the task of setting this up, and you can have an API serving predictions in minutes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration and testing with business systems</strong>: Having an API is only part of the story—you will now need to integrate this API into your business systems. Sometimes, you can serve up predictions to users via standalone Excel files or web pages, but for many use cases integration is required. This can sometimes take time and effort and can slow things down. Another potential path that many organizations are beginning to use is <strong class="bold">robotic process automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">RPA</strong>). DataRobot<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> offers integrations with several RPA tools that can speed up the integration process if your use case is amenable to an RPA implementation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Building an end use interface</strong>: This is not needed if your use case calls for complete automation, but most use cases will have some level of user involvement. With integration out of the way, you will still require some way for the user to interact with the prediction and make appropriate decisions. You will need to consider how users will adjust to a new way of doing business and how to make this experience as frictionless as possible. In fact, in many use cases, the predictions are specifically set up to reduce friction in an existing process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User training</strong>: Make <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>sure you are planning for and ready to offer <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>training to users whose workflow is being impacted by the new models. Creating training and offering this training is a great way to increase adoption and acceptance of the model. Many times, this is thought of after the fact and can cause delays or reduce acceptance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User acceptance and change management</strong>: This is typically an ongoing process. It is generally a good idea to involve users and stakeholders from the start. If users feel that their voice is heard, this will improve the chances of acceptance. Users can also help avoid potential problems that the data science team will not catch on their own. Frequent communication about why you are doing this project, how it impacts the users, and how their work will change (hopefully for the better) are all good strategies to improve your odds of success. Building the diagrams listed previously in conjunction with users is a great way to start this dialog and is ultimately what adds value to the business. As you can see, many things have to happen before and after a model is built to realize value. It is no wonder that projects often do not succeed in adding value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model monitoring and maintenance</strong>: Once the model is operational, you will need to set up mechanisms to monitor the prediction service and the performance. Over time, the performance tends to degrade, or you might want to improve the performance of the model. This requires the models to be updated or retrained with new data. Luckily, DataRobot makes these tasks very easy as it provides mechanisms to set up the monitoring and retraining of the models.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered some tools and methods to help you gain an understanding of your system and the business problem you are trying to solve. Some of these methods will be new or unfamiliar to even experienced data scientists, but it is important to take the time to internalize them and practice them on your projects. Some of this will feel unnecessary given the time pressures. This is one of the reasons tools such as DataRobot are beneficial, as they reduce the time you need to spend on repetitive tasks and allow you to focus on things that tools cannot do.</p>
			<p>Hopefully, I have convinced you that the combination of data science teams focusing more on understanding the problem and using automation tools for some of the model building and tuning tasks provides the best value to an organization. A lot of the work done here will also come in handy toward the end of the project when we are getting ready to operationalize the models into the organization. Specifically, in this chapter, we have learned how to understand the broader system context, how the system operates, and why it behaves a certain way. We also saw how to get to the root problem that a business needs to solve and turn the business problem into a form that can be solved with ML. We then learned how to make sure that the solution solves the right problem and does not create unintended side effects.</p>
			<p>Finally, we learned how to make sure that the solution is accepted by the stakeholders and gets operationalized, leading to the realization of business value.</p>
			<p>We are now ready to start working with some example datasets and begin using DataRobot to help solve the business problem we have uncovered and the ML problem we have defined.</p>
