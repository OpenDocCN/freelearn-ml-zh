    predictive modeling, machine learning, and data mining that aim to analyze current
    and historical facts to produce results referred to as predictions about the future
    or otherwise unknown events.'

    and data miners for predictive modeling and data mining. With its constantly growing
    community and plethora of packages, R offers the functionality to deal with a
    truly vast array of problems.

- en: This book builds upon its first edition, meaning to be both a guide and a reference
    to the reader wanting to move beyond the basics of predictive modeling. The book
    begins with a dedicated chapter on the language of models as well as the predictive
    modeling process. Each subsequent chapter tackles a particular type of model,
    such as neural networks, and focuses on the three important questions of how the
    model works, how to use R to train it, and how to measure and assess its performance
    using real-world datasets.

- en: This second edition provides up-to-date in-depth information on topics such
    as *Performance Metrics and Learning Curves*, *Polynomial Regression*, *Poisson*
    and *Negative Binomial Regression*, *back-propagation*, *Radial Basis Function
    Networks*, and more. A chapter has also been added that focuses on working with
    very large datasets. By the end of this book, you will have explored and tested
    the most popular modeling techniques in use on real-world datasets and mastered
    a diverse range of techniques in predictive analytics.
