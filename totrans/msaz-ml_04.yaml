- en: For any data analysis, you need data as input. Data analysis generates results
    as a dataset, which needs to be stored for future use. **ML Studio** allows you
    to import and export data in a variety of different formats. You can use the `Reader`
    module to import a dataset in ML Studio from external sources and you can use
    the `Writer` module to export a dataset. You can also download and upload datasets
    to and from your PC respectively for different data formats.

    table (DotNetTable), is primarily used to move data between modules inside an
    experiment. When you import data from external sources to ML Studio, the formats
