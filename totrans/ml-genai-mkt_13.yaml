    race, from the main model’s outputs or internal representations. During training,
    the main model is penalized not only for prediction errors but also for the adversarial

    also reduce their exposure to potential data misuse. Any collected data should
    be used solely for the stated purpose, and if additional uses are identified later,
    explicit consent should be obtained from the consumer. For example, if a marketing
    team initially collects data for a targeted email campaign, they should seek further
    consent if they later wish to use this data for a different, unrelated marketing
    initiative. Consumers should have a clear understanding of what data is collected,
    how it will be used, and their rights regarding data control. One way of implementing
    this is through privacy policies, which clearly communicate what data is collected,
    how it is used, and the benefits of sharing information for personalized marketing.
    Privacy policies should be user-friendly and comprehensible, offering clear opt-in
    and opt-out mechanisms. For instance, a company’s privacy policy might explain
    that data collected from website interactions will be used to personalize product
    recommendations, but users can opt out if they prefer not to have their data used

    to evaluate AI marketing strategies from multiple perspectives. These committees
    may include members such as ethicists, lawyers, engineers, and business strategists.

- en: However, the effectiveness of these committees in guaranteeing transparency
    and fairness is not guaranteed, and it’s crucial for these committees to have
    clear mandates and the authority to influence decisions to ensure they are truly
    able to impact ethical risks. While smaller companies may lack the resources to
    establish formal committees, it remains crucial for them to prioritize ethical
    considerations in their AI practices, possibly by designating a responsible individual
    or small team to oversee these issues.

    should document the datasets used for training, any preprocessing techniques applied

- en: From a marketer’s perspective, once these limitations and biases are identified,
    they can be addressed by tweaking the marketing strategies. This might involve
    reassessing target audiences to promote more diverse representation, creating
    more inclusive messaging that resonates with broader demographics, and continuously
    monitoring campaign performance to identify and correct any emerging biases. Regular
    compliance audits and transparent reporting are crucial for tracking adherence
    to regulations and identifying areas for improvement. For example, an audit might
    review how consumer data is stored and accessed, ensuring that encryption and
    access control measures are in place.
