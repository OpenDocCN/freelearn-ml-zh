- en: Augmented reality, driving assistance, video monitoring; more and more applications
    are now using computer vision and image analysis technologies, and yet we are
    still in the infancy of the development of new computerized systems capable of
    understanding our worlds through the sense of vision. And with the advent of powerful
    and affordable computing devices and visual sensors, it has never been easier
    to create sophisticated imaging applications. A multitude of software tools and
    libraries manipulating images and videos are available, but for anyone who wishes
    to develop smart vision-based applications, the OpenCV library is the tool to
    use. OpenCV (Open source Computer Vision) is an open source library containing
    more than 500 optimized algorithms for image and video analysis. Since its introduction
    in 1999, it has been largely adopted as the primary development tool by the community
    of researchers and developers in computer vision. OpenCV was originally developed
    at Intel by a team led by Gary Bradski as an initiative to advance research in
    vision and promote the development of rich vision-based, CPU-intensive applications.
    After a series of beta releases, version 1.0 was launched in 2006\. A second major
    release occurred in 2009 with the launch of OpenCV 2 that proposed important changes,
    especially the new C++ interface, which we use in this book. In 2012, OpenCV reshaped
    itself as a non-profit foundation ([http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/)) relying
    on crowdfunding for its future development. OpenCV3 was introduced in 2013; changes
    were made mainly to improve the usability of library. Its structure has been revised
    to remove the unnecessary dependencies, large modules have been split into smaller
    ones and the API has been refined. This book is the third edition of the *OpenCV
    Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook* and the first one that covers
    OpenCV version 3\. All the programming recipes of the previous editions have been
    reviewed and updated. We also have added new content and new chapters to provide
    readers with even better coverage of the essential functionalities of the library.
    This book covers many of the library’s features and explains how to use them to
    accomplish specific tasks. Our objective is not to provide detailed coverage of
    every option offered by the OpenCV functions and classes but rather to give you
    the elements you need to build your applications from the ground up. We also explore,
    in this book, fundamental concepts in image analysis and we describe some of the
    important algorithms in computer vision. This book is an opportunity for you to
    get introduced to the world of image and video analysis. But this is just the
    beginning. The good news is that OpenCV continues to evolve and expand. Just consult
    the OpenCV online documentation at [http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/) to
    stay updated about what the library can do for you. You can also visit the author’s
    website at [http://www.laganiere.name/](http://www.laganiere.name/) for updated
    information about this cookbook.
