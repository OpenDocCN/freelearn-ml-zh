- en: Machine learning is one of the star disciplines at present. Acclaimed by the
    media as the future of work, it is said to be part of any significant tech investment
    in recent months, in a world where everything is driven by data and automation.
    It is used extensively across many fields such as image understanding, robotics,
    search engines, self-driving cars, and so on and the number of areas of application
    increases almost daily. In this book we will study the motivations and current
    techniques of machine learning using code and diagrams as the main conceptual
    vehicles, omitting outside the fundamental mathematical results.

- en: We will start talking about the fundamental machine learning concepts, its branches,
    and types of problems. Then, there will be an explanatory chapter about the fundamental
    mathematical concepts required to grasp upcoming techniques. As we advance through
    the chapters, models of increasing complexity and sophistication are explained,
    starting with linear regression, then logistic regression, neural networks and
    its more recent variants (CNNs, RNNs),concluding with a synthetic introduction
    to more advanced machine learning techniques, such as GANs and reinforcement learning.

- en: This book is aimed at developers looking to finally grasp what that machine
    learning hype is all about, and understand the main fundamental concepts, using
    an algorithmic point of view, along with more formal mathematical definitions.This
    book implements code concepts in Python, considering the simplicity of its interface,
    and the fact that Python offers an unmatched set of tools to continue learning
    from the bookâ€™s code. So, familiarity with Python programming would certainly
    be helpful for playing around with the code, but it should be manageable from
    programmers experienced in other languages.

    you need to solve your own machine learning problems, and a knowledge of how those
    algorithms work to get the best possible results. If you want to understand machine
    learning in day-to-day, coder-friendly language, and have just the right amount
    of information to be able to do the jump into the discipline, this book will definitely
    come to your rescue!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is focused on machine learning concepts and uses as a Python language
    (version 3) as a computational tool . We have used Python 3 and the Jupyter Notebook
    to build our workbooks, which you can edit and play with to better understand
    the concepts. We focus on how to utilize various Python libraries in the best
    possible way to build real-world applications. In that spirit, we have tried to
    keep all the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will
    enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use it in different
    scenarios.

    of machine learning concepts through a computationally-intensive approach. This
    book should be suited to people who have programmed in any scripting language,
    but being familiar with Python will be useful to play around with the code. It
    will also be useful for current data scientists to get back to the basic concepts,
    and understand them using a novel, hands-on approach.
