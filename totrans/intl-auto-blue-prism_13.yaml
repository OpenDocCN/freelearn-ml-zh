    BP’s IA portfolio. In this chapter, we’ll discuss four of these products. Our
    goals for this chapter are to understand the products’ purpose and to see how
    they fit into IA. We’ll also walk through the high-level steps of using each product.
    Finally, we’ll see what next steps are needed if you’d like to try them out and
    how to find out more information. To finish off the book, I’ll also discuss what
    I think are the future trends of IA.

    document classification, entity extraction, table extraction, and a web interface
    for HITL correction and training of documents. Decipher was released in June 2020
    and has received continuous upgrades since, so it has been battle-tested by many
    other firms. If you need to extract content from scans or images of computer-generated
    (not handwritten) documents, you should consider using Decipher.'

    of the most common IA use cases, so much so, that every major RPA vendor has a
    product dedicated to that task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Behind the scenes, Decipher uses ML in multiple places. First, Decipher uses
    an OCR engine (Tesseract), which itself has pretrained ML models that are used
    to recognize text. Next, Decipher can train *document classification models* to
    differentiate between different types of documents. For example, you might have
    an email account that receives both quotations and invoices as attachments. Decipher
    can help you differentiate between these two types of documents and start them
    down different automation processing paths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decipher can also train document-specific models to *extract pre-specified entities*,
    or *structured data* from documents. Pre-specified means that you have to tell
    Decipher ahead of time what you’re trying to extract, for example, an invoice
    number or a total price. When you’re presented with the web UI to correct the
    entity predictions, you’ll see exactly the fields that you’ve specified. Decipher
    can also handle *semi-structured* data, meaning documents with fields in fixed
    positions, as well as tabular items that can vary in length.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    plugin requires a GPU to be installed. From looking at the third-party license
    acknowledgments of the plugin, it uses Keras and Tensorflow, indicating that some
    neural networks or deep learning models are being used here.

    correct predictions for extracted document fields. The extracted fields for your
    pre-specified entities are displayed side-by-side to the actual document so that
    it’s easy to compare the two and make amendments.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t think that Decision is suitable for use cases where there are many columns
    of input data (> 10). The reason for this is that “training” is done one sample
    at a time through Hub’s web UI by someone manually looking at the inputs and telling
    Decision what the prediction should be. Large numbers of inputs make this process
    very cumbersome. I also think that Decision has to compete with a viable alternative,
    which is to simply create the complicated logic diagram through the Process Studio.
    Another point to consider is how straightforward the logic is to change. Imagine
    you need to add another input to the model, or add another prediction output possibility.
    This could lead to redoing the entire “training” process of the model, which could
    be extremely time consuming, since it’s done through a web UI. It might be easier
    to modify a Process diagram instead.

    longer. While the use cases of LLMs remain in the class of cognitive skills that
    can be done by junior high school students, such as data extraction and text generation,

    that focuses on extracting data from poor-quality scanned documents with handwriting

    on Hub. First, specify what the predicted output should be. Then define the inputs.
    Decision then presents the user with different combinations of inputs, and asks

- en: This concludes the research summary. IA should be a *strategic* and *transformational*
    initiative across the entire firm. This requires careful change and *risk controls*.
    But without the groundwork to understand the risks in adopting IA, firms will
    hesitate to truly transform themselves. Doing this groundwork to uncover the risks
    of IA, along with the ways to mitigate them, is my contribution to this growing
    field. By sharing this information, I hope that you will be able to deliver better
    IA solutions and catalyze the adoption of IA throughout the industry.
