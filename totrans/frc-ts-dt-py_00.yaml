- en: 'In 2017, Facebook (now Meta) released its Prophet software as open source.
    This powerful tool was developed by Facebook engineers because its analysts were
    overwhelmed with the number of business forecasts demanded by managers. The developers
    of Prophet wanted to simultaneously solve two problems: 1) completely automatic
    forecasting techniques are too brittle and inflexible to handle additional knowledge,
    and 2) analysts who are consistently able to produce high-quality forecasts are
    rare and require extensive expertise. Prophet successfully solved both of these
    problems.'

- en: Prophet was designed so that forecasts produced with no parameter tuning or
    other optimizations are usually very high-quality. Nevertheless, with just a little
    bit of training, anyone can intuitively tweak the model and increase performance
    dramatically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting from the most basic model and advancing to the deepest technical dives
    into Prophet’s inner workings, this book will teach you everything there is to
    know about Prophet. Many advanced features not even covered by the official documentation
    are discussed here, with complete working examples for every topic covered. This
    book is not intended to provide you with the ability to build a Prophet clone
    from scratch, but it will teach you how to use Prophet just as well as, if not
    better than, Meta’s own highly trained engineers.

    changed dramatically. The global COVID pandemic disrupted every forecaster’s predictions,
    and we all are still struggling to learn how to forecast in this new world. The
    second edition of this book includes an update on our understanding of how to
    forecast during these types of unexpected events.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, since the first edition, Prophet has seen many updates, including
    graduating from beta status and releasing an official version 1! We have updated
    every section and code block in this second edition with all of the new features
    and changes in Prophet since the publication of the first edition.

- en: The data science teams of several other companies have also open sourced their
    own forecasting packages in recent years, and we have included a new discussion
    of NeuralProphet, LinkedIn’s Greykite, and Uber’s Orbit and their strengths and
    weaknesses compared to Prophet. Because of the encouraging feedback from so many
    readers of the first edition, we have written an entirely new chapter all about
    the math behind Prophet. This new chapter will give you a richer understanding
    of how to build the very best forecasts for your domain and provide the knowledge
    to explain to stakeholders exactly how your forecasts have been developed.

    learning engineers, and software engineers who want to build time series forecasts
    in Python or R. To get the most out of this book, you should have a basic understanding
    of time series data and be able to differentiate it from other types of data.
    Basic knowledge of forecasting techniques is a plus.

    discuss why Facebook (now Meta) decided to build its own forecasting package and

    chapter will also present the mathematical equations underpinning the forecasting
    algorithms within Prophet.'

    will cover how to modify the approach taken in [*Chapter 2*](B19630_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104),
    *Getting Started with Prophet*, in order to handle data that is recorded on a
    scale other than daily, so that you will be set up to work through all of the
    examples in later chapters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19630_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor254), *Working with Seasonality*,
    will discuss all of the ways to control seasonality in Prophet. Seasonality is
    one of the building blocks of Prophet models and contains the most control parameters,
    so this chapter is the longest but also one of the most important.'

    how to include a basic set of default holidays, how to change that set for different
    regions, how to add your own custom holidays, and how to control the strength
    of the effect.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B19630_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor537), *Influencing Trend Changepoints*,
    will talk about how to control the rigidity of your final model. You will learn
    how to make a flexible model that can change direction often or a rigid model
    that follows a constant line, why you may choose one or the other, and about the
    effect this has on the uncertainty of your model being used on future data.'

    at [https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/). Similarly,
    this book will cover how to build interactive Prophet visualizations in Plotly
    but putting those together into a Dash dashboard will be left up to the reader
    to learn elsewhere. The Dash documentation at [https://dash.plotly.com/](https://dash.plotly.com/)
