- en: '**Machine learning** (**ML**) and **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) have
    continued to evolve rapidly in the past two years, with significant advancements
    and applications in various fields. AI and ML systems often process vast amounts
    of sensitive data, including personal information. Ensuring the security of this
    data is crucial to protect against breaches that could lead to identity theft,
    financial fraud, and other privacy violations. On top of this, governments and
    regulatory bodies are implementing stricter data protection and privacy laws.
    Compliance with these regulations is essential for legal and ethical operations.
    This is why securing those systems has become more vital than ever. As cyber threats
    evolve, AI and ML systems must be designed to adapt and respond to new and emerging
    security challenges, ensuring long-term resilience and reliability.'

    the vulnerability of data, models, and environments and implement the best practices
    to manage, secure, and monitor Azure Machine Learning workloads throughout the
    ML life cycle.

- en: This book starts by providing an overview of what you need to protect. This
    includes learning about the Zero Trust strategy, using the MITRE ATLAS framework
    to understand ML attacks, and learning how to work ethically and responsibly,
    by using multiple services to help you stay compliant with industry standards
    and regulations. If you have never worked with Azure Machine Learning, you will
    also find a project in the beginning to get started. From there on, the book focuses
    on data and all the best practices to protect it. That includes everything from
    developing a data management framework to data encryption, backup, and recovery
    best practices. Following that, the book focuses on any infrastructure that surrounds
    Azure Machine Learning workloads, starting from identity and access and then going
    through networking and compute best practices. Finally, it provides all the needed
    information to automate these processes and monitor the system to prevent, detect,
    and mitigate any issues, and provides an overview of threat modeling to help you
    re-assess and keep your Azure Machine Learning workloads secure.
