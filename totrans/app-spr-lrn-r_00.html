			<p>R was one of the first programming languages developed for statistical computing and data analysis with excellent support for visualization. With the rise of data science, R emerged as an undoubtedly good choice of programming language among many data science practitioners. Since R was open source and extremely powerful in building sophisticated statistical models, it quickly found adoption in both industry and academia.</p>
			<p><em class="italics">Applied Supervised Learning with R</em> covers the complete process of using R to develop applications using supervised machine learning algorithms that cater to your business needs. Your learning curve starts with developing your analytical thinking to create a problem statement using business inputs or domain research. You will learn about many evaluation metrics that compare various algorithms, and you will then use these metrics to select the best algorithm for your problem. After finalizing the algorithm you want to use, you will study hyperparameter optimization techniques to fine-tune your set of optimal parameters. To avoid overfitting your model, you will also be shown how to add various regularization terms. You will also learn about deploying your model into a production environment.</p>
			<p>When you have completed the book, you will be an expert at modeling supervised machine learning algorithms to precisely fulfill your business needs.</p>
