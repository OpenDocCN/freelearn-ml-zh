- en: In the preceding chapters, you created a chatbot using the Amazon Lex service,
    named `MarketNanny`. This chatbot receives input from you about a stock ticker
    symbol and then, relays that information to a Lambda function, which then goes
    out to an external `API` and retrieves that information. The Lambda function then
    sends this information back to the chatbot, which in turn provides it to you by
    means of conversational text and speech interfaces.

    you learned how to set up a voice-based call center using the Amazon Connect service.
    You created a contact flow and populated it with the appropriate nodes and properties
    for those nodes to connect to your `MarketNanny` chatbot and allow anyone to converse
    with the chatbot through a voice interface that's available by dialing a local

    various image processing tasks. First, you will identify objects and scenes within
    images. Then, you will test whether images may be flagged as needing content moderation.
    Next, you will analyze faces using Rekognition. You will also recognize celebrities
    and well-known people in images. You will compare faces that appear in different
    images and settings (for example, in groups or in isolation) and recognize the
    same people in different images. Finally, you will extract text from images that
    might have some text displayed in them.

    (that is, the reference confront) with up to 100 countenances recognized in the
    objective picture (that is, the examination appearances), and after that, discovers

    might see that the service has placed a bounding box not just around the license
    plate but also around other text on the upper grille of the car, which it believes
    it is able to identify. The results are as follows:![ Figure 6.48: Results of

- en: In this chapter, you learned how to use the various features of the Amazon Rekognition
    service and applied this to images. First, you used the service to recognize objects
    and scenes in images. Next, you moderated images that might have objectionable
    content by using Rekognition to recognize the objectionable content in the images.

    their gender, age range, whether they were smiling, and whether they were wearing
    glasses.

    The nature of machine learning and artificial intelligence is that immense strides
    have been made recently, today, and into the foreseeable future in terms of what
    computers are going to be able to do — and AWS will be able to provide these services
    to you and your applications!
