- en: Living in times when self-driving vehicles are becoming a reality might trigger
    curious minds as to how could computers' incipient vision works. Having a face
    recognized for access control, getting our pictures automatically organized by
    a subject or person, and having characters automatically recognized from paper
    scans are tasks that have become common in our lives. All these aforementioned
    actions have been enlisted in the so-called study area of computer vision.

- en: As a scientific discipline, the theory behind systems that can extract information
    from images can be described as computer vision, and it has been adopted to extract
    valuable measurements from medical images, as well as to help humans delineate
    the boundaries of important image areas in the so-called semi-automatic procedures.

- en: 'In the context of providing a simple-to-use computer vision infrastructure
    to help people rapidly build sophisticated vision applications, an open source
    library was created: OpenCV. It was designed for real-time applications and is
    written in C++, containing several hundred computer vision algorithms.'

- en: Although OpenCV had its debut alpha release back in January 1999, it was only
    in February 2013 that it officially supported desktop Java through bindings. As
    this is one of the most popular introductory teaching languages adopted in computer
    science departments as well as K-12 computer-related courses, it is important
    to have a good reference for how to build vision apps in a Java environment.

- en: This book covers the basic OpenCV computer vision algorithms and their integration
    with Java. As the Swing GUI widget toolkit is widely adopted to build GUIs in
    Java, in this book, you will benefit from the chapters that deal with this topic
    as well as come to know how to set up your development environment that deals
    with native code bindings. Besides, operations such as stretching, shrinking,
    warping, and rotating, as well as finding edges, lines, and circles are all covered
    through interesting and practical sample projects in this book.

    learning, and in this book, you will find useful information to create your own
    object tracker and to use OpenCV's built-in face tracker as well.

    vision applications on the server side as well, explaining the details of image
    uploading and integration with OpenCV.

    with OpenCV from setup to server side; a brief explanation of the basic computer
    vision topics are covered in the book. Also, you'll get the source code of several
    complete projects from which you can extend and add your own functionality.
