			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) democratization is one of the fastest growing trends in the AI industry. In this field, BigQuery ML represents a fundamental tool for bridging the gap between data analysis and the implementation of innovative ML models. Through this book, you will have the opportunity to learn how to use BigQuery and BigQuery ML with an incremental approach that combines technical explanations with hands-on exercises. Following a brief introduction, you will immediately be able to build ML models on concrete use cases using BigQuery ML. By the end of this book, you will be able to choose the right ML algorithm to train, evaluate, and use advanced ML models.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for data scientists, data analysts, data engineers, and anyone looking to get started with Google's BigQuery ML. You'll also find this book useful if you want to accelerate the development of ML models or if you are a business user who wants to apply ML in an easy way using SQL. A basic knowledge of BigQuery and SQL is required.</p>
