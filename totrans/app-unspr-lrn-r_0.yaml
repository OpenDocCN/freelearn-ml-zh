    learning – clustering – and explains the three main clustering algorithms: k-means,
    divisive, and agglomerative. Following this, you''ll study market basket analysis,
    kernel density estimation, principal component analysis, and anomaly detection.
    You''ll be introduced to these methods using code written in R, with further instructions
    on how to work with, edit, and improve R code. To help you gain a practical understanding,
    the book also features useful tips on applying these methods to real business
    problems, including market segmentation and fraud detection. By working through
    interesting activities, you''ll explore data encoders and latent variable models.'

    who have an interest in unsupervised learning. Although the book is for beginners,
    it will be beneficial to have some basic, beginner-level familiarity with R. This
    includes an understanding of how to open the R console, how to read data, and
    how to create a loop. To easily understand the concepts of this book, you should
    also know basic mathematical concepts, including exponents, square roots, means,
    and medians.'
