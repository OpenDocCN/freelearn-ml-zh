<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-328"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Understanding AI risk scenarios</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Many of the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1246"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> organizations I have worked with have very limited knowledge about the risks presented in their AI systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">They often treat AI risks the same way they deal with risks associated with traditional software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">In reality, AI systems present a new set of risks that we do not normally see in traditional software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">With traditional software, the risk is mainly about software vulnerability, a legacy technology stack, malware, misconfiguration, and unauthorized access to data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.5">AI systems are exposed to many of the same software risks; additionally, AI systems can present new kinds of risks such as bias and misinformation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.6">These risks can have significant negative consequences for organizations </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1247"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">and individuals that rely on AI systems for business operations and decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">AI risks can manifest in many different ways, such as displaying biased behavior or producing unexpected prediction results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Many of the AI risk scenarios are also silent risks that are difficult to detect.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">The following are some scenarios where AI risks may arise:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Bias and discrimination</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">: One of the most well-known risks associated with AI is the potential for displaying bias and discrimination in AI systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">This can occur when ML algorithms are trained on biased data or when the algorithms themselves are susceptible to biased behaviors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">In these cases, the algorithms may learn to discriminate against certain groups, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">For example, a bank can have an ML model thatâ€™s trained using biased datasets, such as including gender and ethnic groups as inputs, resulting in discrimination against certain gender or ethnic groups and potential violation of laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.5">Nowadays, many organizations use AI to screen resumes, and it has been found that some of these AI systems have displayed preferences and biases toward certain types of candidates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.6">In 2018, researchers from MIT revealed that facial recognition systems from several major technology companies exhibited significant racial bias, misidentifying darker-skinned individuals at higher rates compared to lighter-skinned individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.7">This incident raised concerns about the potential for AI systems to perpetuate and amplify societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Misinformation and misinterpretation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">: Another risk associated with AI is the potential for generating misinformation and misinterpretation of facts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">This can occur when ML algorithms are used to process large amounts of data, but the data contains errors or inconsistencies that are not easily detected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">As a result, the algorithms may generate inaccurate or misleading results, leading to potential wrong decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">With the fast rise of generative AI technologies, such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion models, it is also becoming more difficult for humans to distinguish reality from hallucination. 
    </span><p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">For example, the rapid advancement of deepfake technologies, which use AI to generate highly realistic synthetic audio, video, and images, has raised concerns about their potential misuse for spreading misinformation, impersonation, and manipulation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Incidents of deepfake videos being used to impersonate public figures and spread false narratives have already been reported.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Lack of interpretability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">: Many ML algorithms, such as neural networks, can be complex and difficult to understand, even for trained experts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">This lack of transparency can make it difficult to identify the causes of problems when they arise, making it harder to develop effective mitigation to address the problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">For example, when ChatGPT provides incorrect responses to user prompts, it is often impossible to understand why it made the mistake. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">For regulated industries, this presents a significant challenge when organizations want to adopt more advanced black-box algorithms such as neural networks, as these organizations often need to provide deterministic responses to specific inputs and questions, and how the decisions are made.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Unintended consequences</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">: ML algorithms can sometimes produce unintended consequences </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1248"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">or side effects that were not foreseen during the development process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">The reason for this is that AI models are often optimized for a specific objective, such as increasing company profit, while ignoring other factors such as gender and race. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">For example, an AI-based target marketing system might target a subset of customers with incentives and benefits, while discriminating against minority or low-income customers, in its pursuit of profit maximization.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Adversarial attacks</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">: ML algorithms can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which involve deliberately manipulating the input data to produce unexpected or undesirable outcomes, or planting backdoor access to ML models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">For example, an attacker could use an adversarial attack to trick an AI-based fraud detection system into classifying fake financial transactions as legitimate transactions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">ML models can also be compromised to reveal training data by using adversarial techniques such as membership inference attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">There have been real-world examples of adversarial attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.5">In 2017, researchers from the University of Michigan demonstrated a method to generate small, innocuous-looking patches that could be placed on physical objects, such as stop signs or pedestrians, to cause state-of-the-art object detection models to misclassify or fail to detect those objects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.6">In another example, a chatbot implemented by a car dealership faced disruptions when mischievous users exploited a loophole, which, at times, prompted the bot to unintentionally propose extraordinary deals like acquiring brand-new cars for minimal costs.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Privacy violation and sensitive data exposure</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">: Nowadays, many of the state-of-the-art models are trained using enormous amounts of data from many different sources, and, sometimes, personal or sensitive information is used in the development of these models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">This inherently increases the risk of potential privacy violations and unintended disclosure of sensitive data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">For example, to train a medical imaging model for cancer detection, you often need real patient data such as CT scans and other </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">protected health information</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">PHI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">) or </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">personal identifiable information</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">PII</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">If not handled correctly, this information can be exposed to people who are not authorized to access it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Also, as part of the model training, some sensitive data can be memorized by the trained model, and the model can potentially disclose this information when making predictions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">In 2020, an investigative report by the New York Times revealed that peopleâ€™s images were used in AI model training without their consent and knowledge.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Third-party risks</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">: While third-party risks also exist with traditional software from third-party vendors, AI systems elevate these risks in areas that we have not seen before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">With the advent of ML techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning from pre-trained models, more and more organizations are building custom models based on existing pre-trained models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">However, given the black-box nature of these pre-trained models, it increases the uncertainty of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1"> the modelsâ€™ behavior and unknowns around the scientific validity of the models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Since the pre-trained models were outside of the security and process controls of the consuming organizations, the consuming organization may inherit risks that may already exist in the pre-trained models such as bias or backdoor attack vulnerabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">For example, models with vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution and file writes have been detected in model hubs such as Hugging Face.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Model testing risks</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">: Compared to traditional software, the testing standards and tools for AI-based software and models are underdeveloped. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Traditional software testing mainly focuses on functional components such as user interface flow or business logic thatâ€™s well defined, and non-functional areas such as scalability and latency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">With AI/ML testing, in addition to many of the traditional software testing requirements, there are new testing concepts such as error analysis of different failure modes, model sensitivity, model robustness, and adversarial testing, which are more difficult to perform than traditional software testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">The available testing tools in this domain are also very limited; often, data scientists and testers need to manually prepare different testing scenarios and testing data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">As you can see, the capabilities of AI systems extend far beyond traditional software, introducing many new potential risks and challenges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">As these advanced technologies gain wide adoption and integration into critical domains, concerns over their responsible development and deployment have come to the forefront. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Recognizing the unique complexities and far-reaching implications of AI, various regulatory bodies have taken proactive steps to establish guidelines and regulations aimed at mitigating these risks and ensuring the ethical and trustworthy use of AI systems.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-329"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">The regulatory landscape around AI risk management</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">With the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1250"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">fast advancement of AI technologies and adoption in critical business decision-making, and the negative impacts that AI systems can potentially have on individuals, organizations, and societies, many countries and jurisdictions have established policies, guidance, and regulations to help manage the risks of AI adoption. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">It is also expected that more and more legislation will be proposed and passed by different countries and jurisdictions at a fast rate.</span></p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-331"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Governance oversight principles</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Implementing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1256"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1"> AI risk management starts with establishing key governance principles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">The principles clarify the ultimate goals for what needs to be accomplished with risk management programs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">Depending on the business and the regulatory environment an organization is in, an organization can make a decision on whether it should be included in its risk management framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.4">The following are some of the key areas for consideration:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Transparency</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">: AI systems should be designed in a way that allows stakeholders to understand how decisions are made and why. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">This may include the ability to explain the ML model predictions, as well as transparency on what and how the data and algorithms are used and implemented.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Accountability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">: Organizations should be accountable for the decisions made by AI systems, including any negative consequences that may arise from their use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">This accountability will ensure the owning organizations are incentivized to institute relevant policies and processes to govern the ML lifecycle.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Data governance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">: Organizations should ensure that the data used to train AI systems is accurate, representative, ethical, and unbiased. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Without proper data governance, it would be highly challenging to trust AI systems that are built with ungoverned data.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Human oversight</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">: While AI systems are meant to make decisions automatically in most cases without human intervention, organizations should have the ability to implement human oversight where required, meaning that humans should be involved in decision-making where it makes sense and should have the ability to override decisions when necessary.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Privacy and security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">: Appropriate policies and processes should be established to ensure AI systems are designed to protect the privacy and security of assets according to laws and regulations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Privacy and security breaches can have significant financial and non-financial implications for an organization.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Fairness</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">: AI systems should not discriminate against certain individuals or groups based on attributes such as race and gender.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Validity and reliability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">: AI systems should be designed to produce reliable and valid results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">Appropriate model validation and testing frameworks and processes need to be implemented to ensure highly reliable and predictable behaviors are displayed by AI systems in production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">Mechanisms should be established to monitor system behaviors with processes for mitigation and rollback when abnormal behaviors are observed.</span></li>
