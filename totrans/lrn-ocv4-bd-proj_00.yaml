- en: OpenCV is one of the most popular libraries used to develop computer vision
    applications. It enables us to run many different computer vision algorithms in
    real time. It has been around for many years, and it has become the standard library
    in this field. One of the main advantages of OpenCV is that it is highly optimized
    and available on almost all platforms.

- en: This book starts off by giving a brief introduction to the various fields in
    computer vision and the associated OpenCV functionalities in C++. Each chapter
    contains real-world examples and code samples to demonstrate the use cases. This
    helps you to easily grasp the topics and understand how they can be applied in
    real life. To sum up, this is a practical guide on how to use OpenCV in C++ and
    build various applications using this library.

- en: This book is for developers who are new to OpenCV and want to develop computer
    vision applications with OpenCV in C++. A basic knowledge of C++ would be helpful
    in understanding this book. This book is also useful for people who want to get
    started with computer vision and understand the underlying concepts. They should
    be aware of basic mathematical concepts, such as vectors, matrices, and matrix
    multiplication, in order to get the most out of this book. During the course of
    this book, you will learn how to build various computer vision applications from
    scratch using OpenCV.
