    <p class="normal">Participation on Kaggle has its benefits: scoring well in the four areas and consequently ranking high in the esteem of other Kagglers certainly brings satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. However, your experience on Kaggle also has an impact beyond Kaggle and can help advance your career. It is not just the experience you gain from participating in competitions, experimenting on data you have never worked on before, or repeating experiments with new techniques; it is also the connections you create with other data scientists and the attention you may get from companies.</p>
    <p class="normal">Although Kaggle is not fully recognized as a qualification by many companies, the work you do in competitions can demonstrate a lot about your capabilities and help you to stand out from the crowd. In this chapter, we will explore ways you can stand out by showcasing your work on Kaggle itself and other sites in an appropriate way. We will cover the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Building your portfolio with Kaggle</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Arranging your online presence beyond Kaggle</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Monitoring competition updates and newsletters</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will conclude the book by exploring how Kaggle can directly affect your career by enhancing your professional network and providing you with career opportunities.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-191" class="heading-1">Building your portfolio with Kaggle</h1>
    <p class="normal">Kaggle’s claim<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> to be the “<em class="italic">home of data science</em>” has to be taken <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/>into perspective. As we have discussed at length, Kaggle is open to everyone willing to compete to figure out the best models in predictive tasks according to a given evaluation metric. </p>
    <p class="normal">There are no restrictions based on where you are in the world, your education, or your proficiency in predictive modeling. Sometimes there are also competitions that are not predictive in nature, for instance, reinforcement learning competitions, algorithmic challenges, and analytical contests that accommodate a larger audience than just data scientists. However, making the best predictions from data according to a metric is the core purpose of Kaggle competitions.</p>
    <p class="normal">Real-world data science, instead, has many facets. First, your priority is to solve problems, and the metric for scoring your model is simply a more or less exact measurement of how well it solves the problem. You may not only be dealing with a single metric but have to take into account multiple ones. In addition, problems are open to being solved in different ways and much depends on how you formulate them.</p>
    <p class="normal">As for data, you seldom get specifications about the data you have to use, and you can modify any existing dataset to fit your needs. Sometimes you can even create your own dataset from scratch if you need to. There are no indications about how to put data together or process it. When solving a problem, you also have to consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Technical debt</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Maintainability of the solution over time</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Time and computational costs for running the solution</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Explainability of the workings of the model</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Impact on the operating income (if the real-world project is a business one, increasing profits and/or reducing costs is the leitmotif)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Communication of the results at different levels of complexity and abstraction</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Often, all these aspects count more than raw performance against evaluation metrics.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Technical debt</strong> is a term more common in software development than data science, though it is a relevant one. For technical debt, you should consider whatever you have to do in order to deliver your project faster but that you will have to redo again later at a higher cost. The classic paper <em class="italic">Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems</em> by <em class="italic">David Sculley</em> and other Google researchers should enlighten you on the relevance of the problem for data science: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf"><span class="url">https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf</span></a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Not all this expertise can be supplemented by Kaggle competitions. Most of this should be gained by direct practice and experience-building in an enterprise environment. Yet, the knowledge and skills attached to Kaggle competitions are not completely separate from many of the considerations we discussed above, and they are a good complement to many of the enterprise-level data science processes. By competing on Kaggle, you are being exposed to different types of data and problems; you need to execute extensive feature engineering and fast iterations of model hypotheses; you also have to devise methods of putting together state-of-the-art solutions using common open-source packages. This is a set of valuable skills, and it should be promoted on your side. The best way to do so is to build a <strong class="keyWord">portfolio</strong>, a collection of your solutions and work based on Kaggle competitions and other resources from Kaggle.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to build a <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>portfolio from Kaggle competitions, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/> can take multiple approaches. The easiest is to leverage the facilities offered by Kaggle, especially the Datasets, Notebooks, and Discussions.</p>

      <p class="normal">Before we<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> proceed, we present a discussion on career opportunities derived from Kaggle in our interview with <em class="italic">Gilberto Titericz</em>. He is a Grandmaster in Competitions and Discussions, the former number 1 in rankings, and the current number 1 in total gold medals from Kaggle competitions. He is also a Senior Data Scientist at NVIDIA and was featured not long ago in an article on Wired on the topic (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/solve-these-tough-data-problems-and-watch-job-offers-roll-in/"><span class="url">https://www.wired.com/story/solve-these-tough-data-problems-and-watch-job-offers-roll-in/</span></a>).</p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">What’s your favourite kind of competition and why? In terms of techniques and solving approaches, what is your specialty on Kaggle?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Since I started to compete on Kaggle in 2011, the types of competitions that I prefer are the ones with structured tabular data. The techniques that I use more in Kaggle are target encoding of categorical features (there are infinite ways to do it wrong) and stacking ensembles.</em></p>

      <p class="interviewHeader">How do you approach a Kaggle competition? How different is this approach to what you do in your day-to-day work?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Kaggle is a great playground for machine learning. The main difference from real-life projects is that in Kaggle we already have the problem very well defined and formatted, the dataset created, the target variable built, and the metric chosen. So, I always start a Kaggle competition playing with EDA</em><em class="italic">.</em><em class="italic"> Understanding the problem and knowing the dataset is one of the keys to an advantage over other players. After that, I spend some time defining a proper validation strategy. This is very important to validate your model correctly and in line with the way that Kaggle scores the private test set. Besides the fact that using a stratified Kfold is something that works for most binary classification problems, we must evaluate if a grouped Kfold or a time-based split must be used in order to </em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/></em><em class="italic">validate correctly, avoid overfitting, and mimic, as much as possible, the private test set. After that, it is important to spend some time running experiments on feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. Also, I always end a competition with at least one Gradient Boosted Tree model and one deep learning-based approach. A blend of such diverse approaches is very important to increase diversity in the predictions and boost the competition metric.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">Has Kaggle helped you in your career? If so, how?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Yes, Kaggle was the main reason I changed the direction of my career. Up to 2016 I worked as an electronic engineer, and due to everything that I learned competing since 2011 I was able to switch to the data science area. Kaggle helped me to understand the concepts of machine learning and apply everything I learned from the theory. In addition, Kaggle is an excellent place for experimentation, where you can download a dataset and play with it to extract the maximum information possible from the data. That, combined with the competition environment, makes it perfect to learn coding and machine learning, and at the same time, it gets addictive and makes you want to learn more and more. Winning a few competitions puts your name at the top of the leaderboard and this is priceless for anyone’s career. Headhunters all around the world look at Kaggle to find good matches for their positions and the knowledge and experience gained from competitions can boost any career.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">How have you built up your portfolio thanks to Kaggle?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Once I joined Kaggle, I spent some years learning all the techniques, algorithms, and tricks to extract more information from data and boost the metrics as much as possible. High accuracy is the main goal of most of the competitions, but to do that relying on luck alone is almost impossible; knowledge and experience play a big role when the goal is to win or at least finish in the gold medal zone. The number of medals I have in Kaggle competitions is my portfolio; up to now (11/2021) it’s 58 gold and 47 silver, which summarizes well the ML experience I got from Kaggle. Taking into account that each competition runs for at least 1 month, this is more than 105 consecutive months of experience doing competitive ML.</em></p>

      <p class="interviewHeader">In your experience, what do inexperienced Kagglers often overlook? What do you know now that you wish you’d known when you first started?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Novices often </em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/></em><em class="italic">overlook a proper validation strategy. That doesn’t just happen in Kaggle; I’ve seen data scientists all around the world building models and neglecting one of the most important things in the experimentation theory. There is no general rule when setting a proper validation strategy, but the data scientist must take into account how the model is going to be used in the future, and make the validation as close as possible to that.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">What mistakes have you made in competitions in the past?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Several mistakes; it is impossible to list them all. I have probably made all the possible combinations of mistakes. The good thing about mistakes is that you can learn from them. Once you make a mistake and you detect it, it is very likely that you won’t make it again. The main mistake people make in Kaggle is to trust in the leaderboard score and not in their local validation score. Overfitting to the leaderboard is a constant in Kaggle and this is the main difference from the real world. In a real project, we must build a strong validation strategy that we can trust, because in the real world the models will be tested on real data and you have only one chance to hit the mark, not multiple submissions per day.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">Are there any particular tools or libraries that you would recommend using for data analysis and machine learning?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Some years ago I would have recommended R, but taking into account how fast Python is growing in the ML space and how generic and easy it is to use in production, I recommend to anyone starting ML that they learn it. In terms of libraries for tabular data, I recommend pandas for manipulation, and if you want speed then go with cuDF (the RAPIDS.ai GPU version of pandas). For EDA, I recommend using DataFrame with the Seaborn or Matplotlib libraries, and for machine learning Scikit-learn, SciPy, cuML (GPU), XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and PyTorch. Keep in mind that building a simple XGBoost model using the raw features is fast and can give you a good benchmark to compare with further models.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">What’s the most important thing someone should keep in mind or do when they’re entering a competition?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Entering a Kaggle competition and submitting a public Notebook is easy, but finishing a competition in the gold zone can be extremely challenging. So the most important thing, at least for me, is to keep in mind that independent of the final ranking, we should use Kaggle to have fun and learn as much as possible from the discussion forums, from the public Notebooks, and even from the post-deadline winners’ posts describing their ideas and what worked. </em></p>

      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Also keep in mind that what makes a competition winner is not just replicating what everyone else is doing, but thinking out of the box and coming up with novel ideas, strategies, architectures, and approaches.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">Do you use other competition platforms? How do they compare to Kaggle?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">I have won a couple </em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/></em><em class="italic">of competitions on other competition platforms, but the main difference compared to Kaggle is the number of users. Kaggle has 171k active users as of November 2021, which makes the forums, Notebooks, and dataset interactions much richer in terms of content. Also, Kaggle offers something unique: Notebooks where you can write and run code for free using Google servers, which can be priceless if you don’t have access to good hardware.</em></p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-192" class="heading-2">Leveraging Notebooks and discussions</h2>
    <p class="normal">Besides<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> rankings<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> themselves, Notebooks<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> are the way to get you noticed on Kaggle because they simultaneously demonstrate how you solve problems, how you present ideas, and how you code them. Conceived as a way to easily and openly share solutions and ideas among participants, Notebooks are the most important tool (after rankings) for demonstrating abilities that are appreciated by employers.</p>
    <p class="normal">In fact, one of the most important changes in the world of data science in recent years has been its transition from a game of outstanding talents (unicorn data scientists) to a team game, where data scientists have to collaborate with each other and with other departments to ensure the success of a project. Consequently, in their hiring processes, companies often care more about you being able to communicate ideas and results, as well as coding in a clean and effective way.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the previous section, we discussed how real-world projects require a wider range of skills, ranging from dealing with technical debt to designing cost-effective solutions. You can still demonstrate these skills on Kaggle, even if they are not the ones that will make you <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>win<a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/> a<a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/> competition. Notebooks are the best tools for doing this.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Working and Learning with Kaggle Notebooks</em>, for an introduction to Kaggle Notebooks.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You will find different types of Notebooks on Kaggle. As a good approximation, we can group them into four categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Solutions and ideas for ranking in a competition</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Exploratory data analysis </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">EDA</strong>) on<a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/> the data</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Tutorials explaining machine learning models or data science principles</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Fresh implementations of models derived from papers or other original solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Each of these can provide you with an edge by means of an interesting set of skills. If solutions and ideas for competitions are the classic way to demonstrate that you know how to tackle a complex problem in data science, the other three can show the world that you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Manipulate, represent, and extract visual and non-visual insights from data (EDA), which is a skill deemed very important in every setting, from scientific research to business</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Educate on data science, opening the door to roles in education, mentorship, and developer advocacy</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Translate research into practice, a key skill at a time when innovations in data science (especially in deep learning) appear daily and need to be translated into working solutions quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Even if you don’t rank highly in Kaggle competitions or have astonishing solutions to present, these other three kinds of Notebooks (EDA, tutorials, and paper implementations) can provide you opportunities in the real world if you can promote them in the best way. To do so, you need to understand how to code readable and interesting Notebooks, which is something that you learn from practice and experience. Since it is an art, our suggestion is to learn from others, especially from the Notebooks Grandmasters who place high in the Notebooks user ranking (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rankings?group=notebooks&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=20"><span class="url">https://www.kaggle.com/rankings?group=notebooks&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=20</span></a>).</p>
    <p class="normal">We recommend you look at what kind of Notebooks they have developed, how they have arranged their work using figures, how they have structured their code, and then, finally, based on your skills and interests, try to imitate one of their Notebooks. We also suggest that you do not bet your chances for success only on code and charts, but also on the <strong class="keyWord">narrative</strong> that you present. No matter whether you are showing off a solution, teaching, or implementing a <a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/>neural architecture in TensorFlow, how you explain the Notebook’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/> cells <a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/>with words is very important in terms of leaving a lasting positive impression.</p>
    <p class="normal">Aside from browsing the Notebooks of high rankers, there is also a way to be notified about less mainstream – yet still finely crafted – Notebooks that have recently appeared on Kaggle. The astrophysicist and passionate Kaggle user Heads or Tails, <em class="italic">Martin Henze</em> (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails"><span class="url">https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails</span></a>), publishes on the discussion forums a weekly <em class="italic">Notebooks of the Week: Hidden Gems</em> post, a collection of the most interesting Notebooks around. At the moment, there are already over 100 volumes and the author continues to search Kaggle for anything that could prove interesting. If you would like to be updated about cool Notebooks, just follow Martin Henze’s profile on Kaggle or check if he has published something new under his discussions from time to time.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you love digging through Notebooks looking for ideas and learning from them, we never tire of stressing that you should not brainlessly copy other people’s work. There are many Notebooks on Kaggle, and often someone copies one, makes some small changes, and re-presents the Notebook to other Kagglers as if it were their own original idea. It is also customary to cherry-pick a function, or part of the code from a Notebook, and insert it into your own. In both these cases, please remember always to quote the source and the author. If you cannot retrace something to the original author, even referring to the last Notebook where you found the code you used is enough. While the main purpose of a showcase is to display your own efforts and skills, it is very important to recognize that some parts of your code or some ideas are taken from elsewhere. Aside from being a sign of respect toward your fellow Kagglers, a source attribution highlights that you are knowledgeable enough to recognize other people’s efforts and inventions, and that you know how to employ them in your own work.</p>
    <p class="normal">In a minor way, discussions on Kaggle’s forums can help you get noticed for specific roles in data science and software development. Initially, discussions on Kaggle were just for communicating with organizers or for asking pressing questions about the competition itself. At the end of competitions, participants seldom felt compelled to present or discuss their solutions. However, since discussions obtained their own user rankings<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> and <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/>mastery<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> grades, you have been able to find much more information on forums.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Leveraging Discussion Forums</em>, for an introduction to discussions on Kaggle.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In our experience, discussions on Kaggle can be split into four categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Competition solutions that explain in detail (sometimes with the help of an associated Notebook) how a team managed to reach a certain position on the private leaderboard</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Help with and an explanation of requirements during a competition</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Thanks, compliments, and chit-chat</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Posts that help and tutor other competitors, explaining things to them</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We have observed that excelling in the last type of post and being widely noticed for it can help you achieve the role of developer advocate, especially if you also have other active channels where you interact with your fellow data scientists (for instance, a Twitch or YouTube channel, a Twitter account, or a Medium blog).</p>
    <p class="normal">With the growth of developer advocate roles in both large companies and start-ups, there is an important demand for experts skilled at helping other data scientists and developers in their projects. If you want to learn more about this role, the following article on <a href="https://draft.dev"><span class="url">draft.dev</span></a> is quite explanatory and exhaustive: <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/what-is-a-developer-advocate"><span class="url">https://draft.dev/learn/what-is-a-developer-advocate</span></a>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-193" class="heading-2">Leveraging Datasets</h2>
    <p class="normal">Kaggle competitions<a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/> are often criticized for<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> presenting data that is already cleaned, well arranged, and far from representative of data found in the real world. Our point of view is slightly different; we find the data that Kaggle presents in competitions can also be quite messy or noisy. Sometimes the data presented will not actually suffice in terms of quality and quantity for getting a top score, and you will need to look around for additional data on the internet.</p>
    <p class="normal">What Kaggle does miss out with regard to data in a data science project is the process of collecting and gathering data in organized repositories and files, a process that, in real-world settings, is not possible to standardize because it differs from company to company and problem to problem. Data handling in the real world should mostly be learned on the field.</p>
    <p class="normal">The introduction of datasets into Kaggle was aimed at mitigating the idea that Kaggle was just focused on modeling problems. Kaggle Datasets are very helpful in this sense because they allow you to create and upload your own data and document the features and their values; they also require you to manage your data over time by planning the frequency with which you are going to update or completely replace it.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Organizing Data with Datasets</em>, for an introduction to Kaggle Datasets.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">More interestingly, in Kaggle Datasets, you are also given the opportunity to attach different analyses and models built using Kaggle Notebooks, uploaded from your data or a competition. These models could be work you came up with during a competition, or something you devised because you studied the uploaded data attentively and found a set of interesting problems you could solve with it.</p>
    <p class="normal">In addition, Kaggle Datasets offer you a template to check for the completeness of the meta-information accompanying your data. A description, tags, a license, sources, and the frequency of updates: these are only a few of the required pieces of information (used to calculate a usability score) that will help anyone using your data to understand how to use it. You may even point out (in the description or in discussions) tasks for the dataset that relate to pending work you would like to do with it. This is a good way to communicate your full understanding of the potential value of the data you have uploaded.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Previously, Tasks were part of the Kaggle Dataset functionality, but they have recently been removed: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/292674"><span class="url">https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/292674</span></a>. Nevertheless, you can use the data description and discussions to point out what you expect your data could be used for.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">All these characteristics make Kaggle Datasets a very good way to show off your experience with problems on Kaggle and, in general, your ability with data and machine learning algorithms, because they allow you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Publish and maintain a dataset</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Demonstrate that you have understood the value of the data with a tasks roadmap</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Show coded and fully working solutions (since Kaggle Notebooks can immediately work on the same data, without any preparation), ranging from data preparation to explanatory data analysis to predictive modeling</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We strongly recommend using Kaggle Datasets for showing off the work you have done during<a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/> Kaggle <a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/>competitions or on any other project, because they separate your work from others’ and integrate data and Notebooks. In short, Kaggle Datasets can demonstrate to anyone a working solution that you have implemented. There is a downside, though: you are mostly tied to a Notebook environment (even when you use scripting), which is not perfectly transparent in terms of the package and version requirements necessary for someone to know to run the code in other environments.</p>
    <p class="normal">In fact, Kaggle Notebooks depend on a Docker environment (<a href="https://www.docker.com/"><span class="url">https://www.docker.com/</span></a>) set by a configuration<a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/> file, a <strong class="keyWord">Dockerfile</strong>, that determines which versions have been installed. When browsing a Notebook, it is not immediately evident what version of packages are being used until you inspect this configuration file. For this purpose, as well as for replicating the settings, the Dockerfile can be found on the Kaggle repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python/blob/main/Dockerfile.tmpl"><span class="url">https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python/blob/main/Dockerfile.tmpl</span></a>), though it changes over time and you may need to keep track of the one used in your work.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, in addition to this aspect, don’t forget that getting even a glimpse of a Dataset and its related Notebooks requires access to the Kaggle community.</p>

      <p class="normal"><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda"><span class="url">https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda</span></a></p>
      <p class="normal">We<a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/> had an inspiring career-oriented talk with <em class="italic">Gabriel Preda</em>, a Kaggle Grandmaster in Datasets, Notebooks, and Discussions, and Principal Data Scientist at Endava. Gabriel has a PhD in Computational Electromagnetics and had a long career in software development before devoting himself completely to data science. When he discovered Kaggle, he felt at home on the platform and invested a lot of time and effort into it, which paid dividends for him professionally.</p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">Has Kaggle helped you in your career? How?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Kaggle helped me to accelerate my learning curve in data science. Before Kaggle, I was looking all around for sources of information or problems to solve, but it was not very methodical or effective. On Kaggle, I found a community of people interested in the same things as me. I was able to see the work of top experts in the field, learn from their published Notebooks with analyses or models, get insights from them, ask them questions, and even compete against them. I was mostly in data analysis at the time I joined Kaggle, but very quickly I started to compete; that means learning how to build, validate, and iteratively improve models. After around two years on Kaggle, I switched my career; I went from managing software projects to a full-time data science job. Kaggle also gave me some visibility, and during interviews with candidates at my present company they mentioned that they wanted to join because they saw that I worked there.</em></p>

      <p class="interviewHeader">Have you ever used something you have done on Kaggle as part of your portfolio to show potential employers?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">I use my Kaggle portfolio as the main source of information for potential employers; my LinkedIn profile points to my Kaggle profile. Also, in recent years, employers have become more aware about Kaggle, and some of them ask specifically about your Kaggle profile. There are also potential employers that make very clear that they do not consider Kaggle relevant. I disagree with this view; personally, before interviewing candidates, I normally check their GitHub and Kaggle profiles. I find them extremely relevant. A good Kaggle profile will demonstrate not only technical skills and experience with certain languages, tools, techniques, or problem-solving skills, but also how well someone is able to communicate through discussions and Notebooks. This is a very important quality for a data scientist.</em></p>
      <p class="interviewHeader">You reached Grandmaster in Notebooks (Kernels) first, then in Discussions, and finally in Datasets. Can you tell us about your journey?</p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">I became the seventh Kernels Grandmaster and I got as high as the third rank. For maybe two</em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/></em><em class="italic"> years I think I was in the top 10 in the Kernels hierarchy as well. I started writing Kernels primarily to improve my knowledge of the R language while analyzing datasets I found more interesting. I also experimented with all kinds of techniques, including polygon clips, building dual meshes of Voronoi polygons, and 2D Delaunay tessellation. I gradually started to focus on exploratory data analysis, followed by building models for datasets and then for competitions. Also, once I started to compete more, I started to write Kernels for competing in Python. About the same time, I began to notice that some of my Kernels attracted attention from Kagglers, primarily upvotes and forks but also favorable comments. Some of my Kernels written for exploration of data in active competitions reached a very wide audience and brought me many gold medals; therefore, I reached the Master and then Grandmaster tier. Currently, I do not publish many Kernels related to competitions; mostly I create starting Kernels related to datasets that I publish.</em></p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">Next, I also obtained the Discussions Grandmaster level. I never anticipated that I would reach this tier in discussions. First, I started commenting on other people’s Kernels. Then, gradually, as I got more involved in competitions, most of my comments were in the discussion sections of active competitions, either asking questions about topics of interest in these competitions or starting new topics, for example, suggesting solutions for one problem in a competition or collections of resources to address various open issues related to the competition. I want to mention a special set of comments that I added. As a Kaggle Kernels Grandmaster (one of the first), I frequently upvoted new Kagglers’ Notebooks when I discovered very good content.</em></p>

      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">In such cases, I try to find a few moments to also praise (especially if the content is of good quality) the achievement of the author. Especially to beginners, giving not only the expression of your appreciation by upvoting their work, but also adding some positive feedback about their contribution, might give them a boost of confidence so that they will invest more in learning and contributing even more on Kaggle. I like to do this, and I hope it helps. I once also compiled a list of recommendations about how to comment on Kaggle. This is the list: be short (but not too short); be specific; provide information, not opinions; praise other people’s work when you have the opportunity; keep calm and try to be helpful; do not tag people in your comments unless it makes sense (for example, if it is a discussion, and you need to direct your comment to someone that addressed you in that thread).</em></p>
      <p class="normal"><em class="italic">The last Grandmaster tier I reached is in Datasets. This is also the tier where I reached the highest ranking, second. My progress through the ranks was slow. I started with something I liked. Getting a high profile in Datasets requires investment in curating, cleaning, and documenting the data. If it is not something that you really like, you most probably will not keep going. I pursued things that were important to me but also to a wider community: to my country, my continent, or the whole world. I published datasets about elections in my country, and about various social, demographic, and economic topics in Europe. I focused on subjects of actuality, that were both relevant and of high importance for the community. For example, during the pandemic, I published datasets on COVID-19 cases, about vaccinations, tests, and virus variants both from my country </em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/></em><em class="italic">and worldwide. I captured data that went beyond simple numerical, tabular values. Text data, especially originating from direct contributions from people, provided important insights for many people. One of my most upvoted datasets consists of collections of Reddit posts and comments or Twitter posts (tweets) on subjects as diverse as vaccine myths, cricket, pandemics, sports events, and political personalities. I invested significantly in automating data collection, data cleaning, and data processing scripts. This saved me precious time (especially for datasets updated frequently – some of them were collected continuously, with scripts triggered every hour) but also made it possible to have better control of the process. Every time I publish a new dataset, I also write one or more starting Kernels. These Kernels are not intended to reach a large audience. I create them as helper Kernels for potential users of my Datasets, so that they find it easier to use the data. In many cases, I prefer to keep the original data (as I collected it, or downloaded from an alternative source) and include a Kernel for data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis as well as the result of this process, the data in a more accessible format. In this way, I try to capture in the dataset more than the data itself; I also provide information about techniques for data transformation.</em></p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-194" class="heading-1">Arranging your online presence beyond Kaggle</h1>
    <p class="normal">Since Kaggle <a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/>Datasets and Notebooks require a Kaggle account, you have to take into account that not everyone may already have one or want to create one just to look at your work. You also have to consider alternatives that are more accessible. More frequently, Kagglers choose to use a project on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/"><span class="url">https://github.com/</span></a>), write an article on <a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/>Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/"><span class="url">https://medium.com/</span></a>) as well as other publishing platforms, or post on their own blog. There are other opportunities to promote your work and skills, however, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Publishing code relevant to Kaggle competitions that can be executed from the browser on <a href="https://deepnote.com/"><span class="url">https://deepnote.com/</span></a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">Setting up a Discord community that gathers Kagglers, such as <em class="italic">Abhishek Thakur</em>’s MLSpace (<a href="https://discord.com/invite/4RMwz64gdH"><span class="url">https://discord.com/invite/4RMwz64gdH</span></a>), or running a YouTube channel (also from Abhishek Thakur: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPRJjIWfyNG4X-CRbnv78A"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPRJjIWfyNG4X-CRbnv78A</span></a>)</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="normal">As you can deduce, there are really quite a lot of opportunities and media through which you can diffuse your work and skills on Kaggle, depending on what you want to achieve. In this chapter, our focus is on just blogs and a GitHub presence (which are the most common choices and quite effective), but you are free to decide on any different approach you deem suitable for your purposes.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-195" class="heading-2">Blogs and publications</h2>
    <p class="normal">Writing can <a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/>be a<a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/> way both to refine your knowledge – because you need to read up on a topic in order to write about it – and to let others know about you and your skills. Getting famous for your writing helps you in various ways, from being spotted by recruiters and companies to building your connections for both Kaggle competitions and your wider professional life.</p>
    <p class="normal">Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook) allows you to post ideas and short pieces of text, and this is something that we do suggest you leverage. Given that data science and Kaggle competition topics require discussion and reasoning at length, the best approach, however, is to write <strong class="keyWord">long articles</strong> and publish them by means of a blog or a website that publishes writing. Ideally, we suggest you coordinate your communication between social media and your articles in order to promote them, with dedicated posts announcing them or discussing key points in your writing.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s first discuss how and where you could publish your articles.</p>
    <p class="normal">An article on Medium, especially on <strong class="keyWord">Medium publications</strong> such as Towards Data Science (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/"><span class="url">https://towardsdatascience.com/</span></a>), can get a lot of attention. Medium publications are shared spaces for stories written around a common theme or topic, usually by multiple authors. As a website, Medium can reach a wide audience of readers and some publications have a very good reputation in the data science community for the quality of their articles. A publication can have one or more editors who select the pieces and assure that their contents are consistent with the policies of the publication and its quality level. Medium <a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/>publications where you could post your articles are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Towards Data Science</strong>, as mentioned (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/questions-96667b06af5"><span class="url">https://towardsdatascience.com/questions-96667b06af5</span></a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Better Programming</strong> (<a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/write-for-us-5c4bcba59397"><span class="url">https://betterprogramming.pub/write-for-us-5c4bcba59397</span></a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Mlearning.ai</strong> (<a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/mlearning-ai-submission-suggestions-b51e2b130bfb"><span class="url">https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/mlearning-ai-submission-suggestions-b51e2b130bfb</span></a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Becoming Human</strong> (<a href="https://becominghuman.ai/write-for-us-48270209de63"><span class="url">https://becominghuman.ai/write-for-us-48270209de63</span></a>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Towards AI</strong> (<a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/submit-your-medium-story-to-towards-ai-a4fa7e8b141d"><span class="url">https://pub.towardsai.net/submit-your-medium-story-to-towards-ai-a4fa7e8b141d</span></a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Each of these publications has the great advantage of already having a large audience, probably larger than your following on social media. You will get more readers than you would probably expect, reaching people at companies as well as other professionals you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/>network<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/> with.</p>
    <p class="normal">Besides Medium, these other websites might also accept your publications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Hacker Noon</strong> (<a href="https://www.publish.hackernoon.com/"><span class="url">https://www.publish.hackernoon.com/</span></a>): Quite popular among tech<a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/> bloggers and contains anything tech-related (it is quite generalist). With a monthly audience of four million people, it is the right place if you want to reach many tech lovers with anything tech-related. Being featured on the top pages is extremely difficult and a double-edged sword: you will get a lot of attention, as well as many critics.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Dev.to</strong> (<a href="https://dev.to/"><span class="url">https://dev.to/</span></a>): Mainly<a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/> has an audience of developers (almost eight hundred thousand) and features articles and tutorials on coding. Your posts should be more focused on the quality and efficacy of your code (modeling is in the background).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">FreeCodeCamp</strong> (<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-news-style-guide/"><span class="url">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-news-style-guide/</span></a>): More<a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> focused on tutorials; people go there to learn how to code. It is ideal for promoting courses on machine learning and promoting new packages.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Analytics Vidhya</strong> (<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/about/write/"><span class="url">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/about/write/</span></a>): Quite popular<a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/> in India; it is more centered around articles explaining machine learning and deep learning building blocks.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">KDnuggets</strong> (<a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/news/submissions.html"><span class="url">https://www.kdnuggets.com/news/submissions.html</span></a>): One of the oldest <a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>publications in data mining. It still has quite a lot of followers (one million unique visitors in March 2021) among the old guard of data scientists and academics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Each publication has strong and weak points and differs in the audience it reaches, so you have to decide which one better suits your content. Start by browsing the publications they offer in order to understand how your writing could fit in.</p>
    <p class="normal">Of course, if you would prefer, you can instead use your own blog. Having your own blog has its advantages, such as no advertising or editorial scrutiny over what you write. On the other hand, you cannot leverage a pre-existing audience and you will have to work to create one by promoting your articles on social media. You can set up your own website from scratch on a web domain of your choice or you could create your own blog on GitHub, too.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">If you decide to use GitHub (since it is free and you may already use it as a repository for your code), here is a simple and fast guide to creating GitHub blog posts: <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"><span class="url">http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/</span></a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">If you need something even more automated, using a platform such as <em class="italic">Jeremy Howard</em>’s <strong class="keyWord">fastpages</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages"><span class="url">https://github.com/fastai/fastpages</span></a>) can <a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/>simplify the way you deal with writing content together with code examples, because it automatically converts notebooks and Word documents into blog pages and publishes them for you.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you prefer to be completely independent and set up your own website, this will require more effort and some expense; domain names and web space are not free. In this case, self-promotion of your content becomes critical.</p>
    <p class="normal">The main advantage of writing about your solutions is the storytelling element, because you have to accompany your code snippets with descriptions and explanations and you need to write in a more verbose way than you could do in a Notebook. In a sense, how you describe your work becomes as important as the code you write. By adjusting the tone of your writing, you can reach different types of audiences. Writing concepts in an accessible way means you will enlarge your audience and connect with more professionals. Writing in a highly technical way instead could impress <a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/>more potential companies that may consider hiring<a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/> you, though limiting the number of readers you get.</p>
    <p class="normal">Since writing is a very personal act and our hints and suggestions won’t apply to every scenario, our general suggestion is to decide beforehand the purpose of your writing and who you would like to reach with it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-196" class="heading-2">GitHub</h2>
    <p class="normal">Aside from writing <a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/>articles and having a code repository you can direct readers to, having your code on GitHub will also help you not to reinvent the wheel in every competition you enter. You can store the code you want to reuse in a project <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/>or in <strong class="keyWord">Gists</strong> (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists"><span class="url">https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists</span></a>), which are small snippets of code that can be accessed individually.</p>
    <p class="normal">Even if it may appeal to you to leave all your code on Kaggle, with time you will find it difficult to access and you may even have trouble finding it altogether. This is because you cannot arrange your Kaggle Notebooks into separate projects; they will just be presented as a long list that you can order by a few attributes such as the number of votes or when you last ran the Notebook. GitHub makes it much easier to find what you need and reuse it. For instance, you can create scripts containing all your code and then download and import them into a Kaggle Notebook without needing to copy anything.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following example, we download and reuse helper functions for a <code class="inlineCode">tabular</code> neural network:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmassaron/deep_learning_for_tabular_data/master/tabular.py
<span class="hljs-comment"># Importing from Tabular</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> tabular <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> gelu, Mish, mish
<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> tabular <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> TabularTransformer, DataGenerator
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">A <code class="inlineCode">wget</code> command <a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/>will directly access code on GitHub and download it onto the disk of the Notebook; afterward, you can just import the functions and classes that you need from it. To obtain the link providing direct access to your code, you just need to look for the file containing it on the GitHub repository and then click on the <strong class="screenText">Raw</strong> button on the header of the page:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B17574_13_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.1: The header of a visualized file on GitHub. Notice the Raw button on the upper right part of the header bar.</p>
    <p class="normal">After clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Raw</strong> button, you will be taken to the web address where the file is stored on GitHub. You can use that web address to refer to the file from outside of GitHub.</p>
    <p class="normal">GitHub is also useful also for storing images that you can use on Kaggle discussions (since you can no longer upload images on the Kaggle forums). In the case of images, you won’t have a <strong class="screenText">Raw</strong> button to click, but you can instead right-click on the image and open the file in another tab; this will have the same effect.</p>
    <p class="normal">GitHub is another great way to showcase your work, but given the nature of the website (it is targeted at developers) and the content you can put on it (files containing code), you should expect a very technical audience. In companies, human resources probably won’t look too deeply at your GitHub account, instead stopping at the <code class="inlineCode">README.md</code>, which should therefore be well written and visually appealing. Recruiting managers, on the other hand, will be more interested in the code in your projects. You should put some effort into having well-structured code in your files, procedures, and classes, also including the instructions necessary for the installation and replication of your results.</p>
    <p class="normal">You will have to use tools <a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/>such as <code class="inlineCode">conda</code> (<a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/"><span class="url">https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/</span></a>) or <code class="inlineCode">poetry</code> (<a href="https://python-poetry.org/"><span class="url">https://python-poetry.org/</span></a>) to ensure the correct <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/>packages are installed for your code to work. In order to give the best<a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/> structure to your project, you’ll probably need something like <code class="inlineCode">CookieCutter</code> (<a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/"><span class="url">https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/</span></a>). Using a <code class="inlineCode">template</code> for your projects, like the ones CookieCutter provides, enables your code to be arranged into specific directories easily and will provide the files that allow its usage and understanding. A CookieCutter template will make your project easier to read, understand, and maintain.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, for managing<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> your experiments and data sources, you will also need some <strong class="keyWord">version control system</strong> for <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/>the data <a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/>being used, not just for your code, for instance using <strong class="keyWord">Data Version Control</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DVC</strong>: <a href="https://dvc.org/"><span class="url">https://dvc.org/</span></a>). All these resources and the skills you need to run them properly (creating your environment, structuring your project, versioning data and models) are closer to software engineering than data science competencies. They are not so relevant on Kaggle – or can be done in simple ways – and will require effort and learning. Yet, they will become part of the capabilities that you will present with your projects on GitHub, improving your chances of making a good impression on job interviewers.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you want to put in live demonstrations of your models, you have a few different options. The easiest is having the code running on the original Notebooks (just by putting a link to your Kaggle Notebook in the <code class="inlineCode">README.md</code> file of your GitHub project) or on <strong class="keyWord">Google Colab</strong>. To have <a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/>the Notebook you stored on GitHub run automatically in Google Colab, just post its link with the domain changed from <a href="https://github.com"><span class="url">github.com</span></a> to <a href="https://githubtocolab.com"><span class="url">githubtocolab.com</span></a>: the link will open your Notebook in Colab.</p>
    <p class="normal">The most impressive showcase you can prepare, however, is using <strong class="keyWord">HuggingFace Spaces</strong> (<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces"><span class="url">https://huggingface.co/spaces</span></a>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/>demonstrate how your Kaggle model could be used in an online application. Spaces are a simple way to host machine learning demonstrations and create online portfolios of your work, as explained in the documentation (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces"><span class="url">https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces</span></a>). They are limited to 16GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores, but they are free and sufficient for demonstrating how your model can run in a dedicated application. You can install your dependencies on the HuggingFace remote machine, sync code and models with GitHub, or build an<a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/> app <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>using <code class="inlineCode">Streamlit</code> (<a href="https://streamlit.io/"><span class="url">https://streamlit.io/</span></a>) or <code class="inlineCode">Gradio</code> (<a href="https://gradio.app/"><span class="url">https://gradio.app/</span></a>).</p>
    <p class="normal">As an example, <em class="italic">Rashmi Banthia</em>, a Kaggle Expert and a Teaching Fellow at Harvard University (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rashmibanthia"><span class="url">https://www.kaggle.com/rashmibanthia</span></a>), has posted a demonstration of her model from the <em class="italic">Sartorious Cell Instance Segmentation</em> competition: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/rashmi/Cell-Instance-Segmentation-MMDetection"><span class="url">https://huggingface.co/spaces/rashmi/Cell-Instance-Segmentation-MMDetection</span></a>. By presenting<a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/> your model together with a few examples in a real-time demonstration, you can immediately convey its effectiveness even to a non-machine learning audience.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-197" class="heading-1">Monitoring competition updates and newsletters</h1>
    <p class="normal">By now, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/>can see that it is important to showcase your<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> work on Kaggle so you can communicate to the world your interest in certain types of models and data problems. From this perspective, it is important that you are always aware of the opportunities offered by competitions.</p>
    <p class="normal">The main way to do this is to visit the Kaggle website frequently and agree to receive emails from them. You can set this option from your profile, on the <strong class="screenText">Notification and e-mail settings</strong> page, where you can agree to receive notifications both on the site and by email. You can also choose to receive emails containing tips on new features and initiatives on Kaggle, along with news about recently launched competitions:</p>
    <p class="packt_figref"><img src="../Images/B17574_13_02.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.2: A Kaggle email announcing a series of videos from the Kaggle Team</p>
    <p class="normal">If you are a Twitter user, you’ll find it useful to follow a couple of profiles to keep you updated about new stuff<a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/> on Kaggle. <strong class="keyWord">Kagoole</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kagoole"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/kagoole</span></a>) is a web application that <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/>can<a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/> inform you about new competitions and also, in its <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/>Heroku app form (<a href="https://kagoole.herokuapp.com/"><span class="url">https://kagoole.herokuapp.com/</span></a>), provides you with solutions for past competitions. It was<a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/> created by <code class="inlineCode">Doarakko</code> (<a href="https://github.com/Doarakko/"><span class="url">https://github.com/Doarakko/</span></a>). The other Twitter profile you could<a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/> follow is<strong class="keyWord"> Is he Kerneler?</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/HKerneler"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/HKerneler</span></a>), created by <code class="inlineCode">Regonn</code> (<a href="https://github.com/regonn/"><span class="url">https://github.com/regonn/</span></a>), which tells you how much time is left before each active Kaggle competition closes.</p>
    <p class="normal">As we know from <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, Kaggle is not the only organization that holds data science competitions. In order to keep better track of what is actually happening both on Kaggle and other data science competition websites, we suggest using websites such as <a href="https://mlcontests.com/"><span class="url">https://mlcontests.com/</span></a> or <a href="https://ods.ai/competitions"><span class="url">https://ods.ai/competitions</span></a> that monitor all ongoing competitions on Kaggle, as well as on other platforms such as AICrowd and DrivenData. For instance, <a href="https://mlcontests.com"><span class="url">mlcontests.com</span></a> provides you with information on prizes, deadlines, and useful links for each competition. </p>
    <p class="normal">It also gives you cloud GPU comparisons in terms of performance, machines, and prices. You can register your email and receive much of this <a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/>information<a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/> directly to your inbox.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-198" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we discussed how to showcase your work and how this can be valuable for progressing your career.
