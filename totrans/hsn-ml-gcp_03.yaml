    platform, Google Storage, for files, and Google SQL, for structured data. Google
    Storage is a file-hosting service that allows you to store files in the cloud.
    Quite simple and straightforward, it is very similar to the Amazon S3 service.
    To go beyond basic usage, we will look into some advanced subjects, such as signed-URLs,
    collaboration bucket settings, optimizing upload speeds, and transferring big

    differences between the two in terms of respective functionalities.

    where the data is stored on multiple servers, real and/or virtual, generally hosted
    at third-party facilities or on dedicated servers. Through this model, it is possible
    to access personal or business information, whether it be videos, music, photographs,
    databases, or files, without knowing the physical location of the data, from any
    part of the world with any suitable device. The advantages of this methodology
    are numerous: infinite capacity of memory space, payment only of the actual amount
    of memory used, files accessible from anywhere in the world, highly reduced maintenance,
    and greater security, as the files are protected from theft, fire, or damage that
    may occur on local computers.'

    interface that makes use of simple HTTP requests to perform operations on its
    infrastructure. With Google Cloud Storage you can perform the following operations:
    uploading a file, downloading a file, deleting a file, obtaining a list of files,
    or obtaining the size of a given file. Each of these HTTP requests contains information
    about the method used and the resource to request. It follows that it becomes
    possible to create an application that, using these HTTP requests, provides a
    service in which applications save data remotely, generally via third-party servers.'

    CPUs is 32\. Google also guarantees a maximum of 25,000 IOPS, that is, input/output
    operations per second. The possibility to choose such resources allows us therefore
    to use Cloud SQL for every type of application, from those with lower workloads
    to applications that require intense performance. There are no limits of **query
    per second** (**QPS**), but there are some limits regarding the connections. In
    fact, up to a maximum of 4,000 concurrent connections are possible in the case
    of second-generation MySQL instances, while for the other cases the limits are
    more stringent.

    increasing the number of servers and instances that work simultaneously. Once
    you have created your instance, you can change the resources allocated for it
    directly from the console. In general, the changes are applied immediately, but
    the restart of the instance will close the existing connections and will need
    a few moments (in the case of first-generation MySQL) or a few minutes (second
