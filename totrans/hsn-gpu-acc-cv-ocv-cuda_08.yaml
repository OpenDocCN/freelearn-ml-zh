- en: The last chapter described various computer vision applications that use OpenCV
    and CUDA. When these applications need to be deployed in real-life situations,
    there is the need for an embedded development board that can process images at
    high speed by taking advantage of OpenCV and CUDA. Nvidia provides several GPU-based
    development boards, such as Jetson TK1, TX1, and TX2, which are ideal for high-end
    computing tasks such as computer vision. One of these development boards, the
    Jetson TX1, will be introduced in this chapter. The features and applications
    with which this board can be used are also discussed in detail. CUDA and OpenCV
    are essential for computer vision applications, so steps to install them on the
    Jetson TX1 are discussed in detail.

- en: When high-end visual computing and computer vision applications need to be deployed
    in real-life scenarios, then embedded development platforms are required, which
    can do computationally intensive tasks efficiently. Platforms such as Raspberry
    Pi can use OpenCV for computer vision applications and camera-interfacing capability,
    but it is very slow for real-time applications. Nvidia, which specializes in GPU
    manufacturing, has developed modules that use GPUs for computationally intensive
    tasks. These modules can be used to deploy computer vision applications on embedded
    platforms and include Jetson TK1, Jetson TX1, and Jetson TX2\.

    Kepler GPU. It is the cheapest of the three. Jetson TX1 is intermediate in terms
    of processing speed, with 256 CUDA cores with Maxwell architecture, operating
    at 998 MHz along with ARM CPU. Jetson TX2 is highest in terms of processing speed
    and price. It comprises 256 CUDA cores with Pascal architecture operating at 1,300
    MHz. This chapter will describe Jetson TX1 in detail.

    to the performance/watt value of 45\. A normal i7 CPU processor has a performance
    of 242 images/second at 62.5 watts, which is equivalent to a performance/watt

    JetPack can't be installed directly on the board, so a PC or virtual machine that
    runs Ubuntu 14.04 is required as a host PC. The installation is not checked with
    the latest version of Ubuntu, but you are free to play around with it. The Jetson
    TX1 board needs peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard, and monitor, which can
    be connected to the USB and HDMI ports. The Jetson TX1 board should be connected
    to the same router as the host machine via an Ethernet cable. The installation
    will also require a micro USB to USB cable to connect the board with a PC for
    transferring packages on the board via serial transfer. Note down the IP address
    of the board by checking the router configuration. If all requirements are satisfied,
    then move to the following section for the installation of JetPack.

    It has a better performance per power dissipation value than the latest i7 processors.
    It can be used in many domains where computer vision and deep learning is used
    for performance improvement and embedded deployment. Nvidia provides a development
    kit that houses this module along with other peripherals, which can be used for
    rapid prototyping of all applications. Nvidia also provides an SDK called JetPack,
    which is a collection of many software packages, such as `OpenCV`, `CUDA`, and
