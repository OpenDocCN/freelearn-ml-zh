It enables us to run many different Computer Vision algorithms in real time. It has been around for many years, and it has become the standard library in this field. One of the main advantages of OpenCV is that it is highly optimized and available on almost all the platforms.</p><p>This book starts off by giving a brief introduction of various fields in Computer Vision and the associated OpenCV functionalities in C++. Each chapter contains real-world examples and code samples to demonstrate the use cases. This helps you to easily grasp the topics and understand how they can be applied in real life. To sum it up, this is a practical guide on how to use OpenCV in C++ and build various applications using this library.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for developers who are new to OpenCV and want to develop Computer Vision applications with OpenCV in C++. A basic knowledge of C++ would be helpful to understand this book. This book is also useful for people who want to get started with Computer Vision and understand the underlying concepts. They should be aware of basic mathematical concepts, such as vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, and so on, to make the most out of this book. During the course of this book, you will learn how to build various Computer Vision applications from scratch using OpenCV.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "For a basic project based on an executable build from one source code file, a two line <code class="literal">CMakeLists.txt</code> file is all that is needed ."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#include "opencv2/opencv.hpp"
using namespace cv;

int main(int, char** argv)
{
  FileStorage fs2("test.yml", FileStorage::READ);
  Mat r;
  fs2["Result"] &gt;&gt; r;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; r &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  fs2.release();
  return 0;
}</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">@Path("departments")
<strong>@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)   </strong>
public class DepartmentResource{
//Class implementation goes here...    
}</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>C:\&gt; setx -m OPENCV_DIR D:\OpenCV\Build\x64\vc11</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "To show the control panel we can push the last tool bar button, right click in any part of <strong>QT Window</strong> and select <strong>Display properties window</strong>."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
