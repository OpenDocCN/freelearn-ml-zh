- en: In this section, we will learn all about training and optimizing traditional
    **Machine Learning** (**ML**) models as well as deep learning models on Azure.
    First, we will investigate the benefits and downsides of traditional ensemble
    techniques and their differences from newer neural network-based models. We will
    then implement and train **Convolutional Neural Networks** (**CNNs**) on Azure
    using the capabilities of Azure Machine Learning services. Following this, we
    will look at ways to optimize model training through hyperparameter tuning and
    automated ML. Furthermore, we will have a look at how to run ML training not on
    a single compute instance, but on a distributed cluster. With the knowledge obtained,
    we'll wrap this section up by building a recommendation engine in the cloud.
