<p class="mce-root"><span>AWS is constantly driving new innovations that empower data scientists to explore a variety of machine learning cloud services. This book is your comprehensive reference for learning about and implementing advanced machine learning algorithms in AWS.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>As you go through this book, you'll gain insights into how these algorithms can be trained, tuned, and deployed in AWS using Apache Spark on Elastic MapReduce, SageMaker, and TensorFlow. While you focus on algorithms such as XGBoost, linear models, Factorization Machines, and deep networks, the book will also provide you with an overview of AWS, as well as detailed practical applications that will help you solve real-world problems. Every practical application includes a series of companion notebooks with all the necessary code to run on AWS. In the next few chapters, you will learn how to use SageMaker and EMR notebooks to perform a range of tasks, from smart analytics and predictive modeling through to sentiment analysis. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span>By the end of this book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to effectively handle machine learning projects and implement and evaluate algorithms on AWS.</span></p>

<p><a href="06270fa5-1364-4ad2-b4a0-3522c1ef7bcd.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Creating Clusters on AWS</em>, discusses that <span>one of the key problems in deep learning is understanding how to scale and parallelize learning on multiple machines. In this chapter, we'll examine different ways to create clusters of learners. In particular, we'll focus on how to parallelize deep learning pipelines through distributed TensorFlow and Apache Spark.</span></p>
<p><a href="7de65295-dd1f-4eb3-af00-3868ed7e2df9.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Optimizing Models in Spark and SageMaker</em>, explains that t<span>he models that are trained on AWS can be further optimized to run smoothly in production environments. In this section, we will discuss various tricks that our readers can use to improve the performance of their algorithms.</span></p>
<p><a href="691fc3d8-e4b8-4e3f-a8d9-e13f53f058c4.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Tuning Clusters for Machine Learning</em>, explains that <span>many data scientists and machine learning practitioners face the problem of scale when attempting to run machine learning data pipelines at scale. In this chapter, we focus primarily on EMR, which is a very powerful tool for running very large machine learning jobs. There are many ways to configure EMR, and not every setup works for every scenario. We will go through the main configurations of EMR and explain how each configuration works for different objectives. Additionally, we'll present other ways to run big data pipelines through AWS.</span></p>
<p><a href="6bc1a319-1195-4c30-8de8-09c795076f10.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>, <em>Deploying Models Built on AWS</em>, discusses deployment. A<span>t this point, readers will have their models built on AWS and would like to ship them to production. We understand that there are a variety of different contexts in which models should be deployed. In some cases, it's as easy as generating a CSV of actions that would be fed to some system. Often, we just need to deploy a web service that's capable of making predictions. However, there are many times in which we need to deploy these models to complex, low-latency, or edge systems. We will go through the different ways you can deploy machine learning models to production.</span></p>

<p>This book covers a number of different frameworks, such as Spark and Tensorflow. However it is not meant to be a comprehensive guide for each. Instead we focus on the way AWS empowers practical machine learning through the use of the different frameworks. We encourage the readers to refer to other books with framework-specific content when necessary. </p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The following screenshot shows the first few lines of our <kbd>df</kbd> dataframe."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>vectorizer = CountVectorizer(input=dem_text + gop_text,<br/>                             stop_words=stop_words,<br/>                             max_features=1200)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>wget -O /tmp/adform.click.2017.01.json.gz https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/:persistentId/?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TADBY7/JCI3VG</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "You can also train a custom NER algorithm in AWS Comprehend using the <span class="packt_screen">Customization</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Custom entity recognition</span> option in the left menu.</span><span>"</span></p>
