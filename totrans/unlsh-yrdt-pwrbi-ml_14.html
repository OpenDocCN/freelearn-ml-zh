			<p><a href="B19500_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a> of this book was an adventure to the cutting edge of technology, as you integrated OpenAI and Azure OpenAI into your Power BI project using the FAA Wildlife Strike data. Over the course of this book, you have walked through a project for ingesting raw data, transforming and prepping the data, building a BI solution for analytics, using analytics to discover data features for predictive ML models, building those ML models, scoring new data with the ML models, and adding new, robust descriptive and summarization capabilities to the solution using LLMs from OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. In <em class="italic">Chapters 12</em> and <em class="italic">13</em>, you augmented and improved text using OpenAI, too. All of this was accomplished, from end to end, using <span class="No-Break">Power BI.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will review what you have accomplished throughout the book and project, revise important key concepts, and then discover some suggestions for future iterations of the project and your career as a data professional. In the real world, most projects are never truly complete. At some point, they may end, but more often than not, there is the opportunity to improve upon the existing solution or expand the scope of the solution to provide more value. Understanding and articulating the outstanding value that can be captured by new iterations of work and communicating that message to stakeholders, along with estimates of the required investments, is key to building your projects to be bigger, better, and <span class="No-Break">more impactful.</span></p>
			<p>Unlike the previous two chapters, this chapter is not written with the assistance of OpenAI, but in the authentic voice of the author (with assistance from human editors <span class="No-Break">and reviewers).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Lessons learned from the book and workshop</h1>
			<p>At the beginning of this book, you started with the objective to provide your leadership with tools to enable interactive analysis of the<a id="_idIndexMarker756"/> FAA Wildlife Strike data, in order to find insights about factors that influence incidents and make predictions about future possible wildlife strike incidents and associated costs. The primary goal of your project, predicting the<a id="_idIndexMarker757"/> future impact of FAA Wildlife Strikes, required building out Power BI ML models. Through the chapters of this book, you walked through the process, using content from the Packt GitHub repository, to plan out and implement an end-to-end project. Everything in this project was achieved using tools within Power BI or that were integrated with Power BI. A high-level summary of the artifacts you created in Power BI is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure</em></span><span class="No-Break"> </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">14</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p>The primary technical <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>training for this book revolved around ML in Power BI, but several other concepts were interwoven with the end-to-end workshop. If you have taken Microsoft’s <strong class="bold">Power BI Dashboard in a Day</strong> course (<a href="https://aka.ms/diad">https://aka.ms/diad</a>), you probably will have found some style similarities between that course and this book, but with ML, AI, and OpenAI added as the pivotal capstone deliverables while also using FAA Wildlife Strike data from the <span class="No-Break">real world.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Exploring the intersection of BI, ML, AI, and OpenAI</h2>
			<p>BI, ML, AI, and OpenAI encompass tools <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>and solution architectures methodologies that overlap with one another but can also be approached as separate disciplines. Within the context of Power BI, many different tools have been combined under the umbrella of a single SaaS platform. Over the years, Power BI has evolved from a data visualization tool to SaaS-ify many different Microsoft tools, as per <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 14</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.2 – Power BI consists of many tools within a SaaS platform</p>
			<p>Within the <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>context of the Power BI SaaS toolset, you walked through the following exercises, which provided a baseline conceptual understanding of when and where to use ML, AI, <span class="No-Break">and OpenAI:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="B19500_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>: You reviewed the use case, browsed the data, and planned your data model to account for a BI design that facilitated data exploration and feature discovery, while also planning for a design that will work <span class="No-Break">with ML.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Chapters 2</em> and <em class="italic">3</em>: You transformed data and created a baseline design for a BI dataset in Power BI. You modeled the data in a way that provided a strong foundation for <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></li>
				<li><a href="B19500_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>: You designed tables of data to be used for ML. These tables were flattened, with each row representing a unique incident with features describing <span class="No-Break">that incident.</span></li>
				<li><a href="B19500_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>: You explored the dataset to find features for ML using the BI tools along with AI visuals. New features were then added to the <span class="No-Break">ML queries.</span></li>
				<li><a href="B19500_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor089"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>: You found new features using R and Python visuals. These features were also added to the queries for Power <span class="No-Break">BI ML.</span></li>
				<li><a href="B19500_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>: You migrated your work from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI cloud service. After this chapter, all of your work was done in the Power BI <span class="No-Break">cloud service.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Chapters 8</em> to <em class="italic">11</em>: You built and improved your ML models. You ran the flattened ML queries through Power BI ML for three separate predictive models, reviewed the training and testing results, and then iterated upon the ML models to improve the <span class="No-Break">predictive capabilities.</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Chapters 12</em> and <em class="italic">13</em>: You added OpenAI and Cognitive Services to the solution for even more value. OpenAI was used to summarize and generate data in <span class="No-Break">readable language.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A visual representation of your efforts is displayed in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 14</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>. Other than the OpenAI integration, everything was done completely within the Power BI SaaS set <span class="No-Break">of tools:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.3 – Project methodology integrating BI, ML, AI, and OpenAI tools within the Power BI SaaS platform</p>
			<p>In summary, you walked through the process of an entire project that started with raw FAA Wildlife Strike data and ended with ML models – all within the SaaS tools of <span class="No-Break">Power BI.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>ML within Power BI</h2>
			<p>Since the name of this book is <em class="italic">Unleashing Your Data with Power BI Machine Learning and OpenAI</em>, the Power BI ML tool is<a id="_idIndexMarker761"/> obviously the capstone component of the workshop and story adventure you have completed. There are a few reasons why the entire book was not based on Power <span class="No-Break">BI ML:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Power BI ML is extremely easy to use, when used properly. It is a version of AutoML, and prepping the data properly can be <span class="No-Break">very difficult.</span></li>
				<li>Many BI experts have never designed and prepped data for ML. The intersection of these skills is the hardest part of using Power BI ML for a <span class="No-Break">BI professional.</span></li>
				<li>The end-to-end workshop affiliated with this book was designed to represent real-world projects as closely as possible. If you completed the workshop, even if you took shortcuts by cutting and pasting scripts and content from GitHub, you should be able to repeat a variation of the process for your own <span class="No-Break">future projects.</span></li>
				<li>At the end of this book, you should now have a very strong understanding of how, when, and why to use ML in <span class="No-Break">Power BI.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You have now<a id="_idIndexMarker762"/> built, assessed, deployed, and re-trained binary prediction, general classification, and regression ML models in Power BI. Not only did you accomplish this feat, but you did it with real data from the FAA Wildlife Strike database. The data was not artificially curated or synthesized to improve your results or make the process easy. As an added bonus, you added some OpenAI and Cognitive Services integration to the project for added value. You should be proud <span class="No-Break">of yourself!</span></p>
			<p>But now the real test begins! How do you ensure that your stakeholders appreciate the results of the project? Is the project done or can you do more to make it better? How can you translate these lessons to your future <span class="No-Break">career plans?</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Looking forward</h1>
			<p>Now that you’ve progressed from defining requirements, to transforming and exploring raw source data from the FAA Wildlife Strike database, to building ML models, to working with OpenAI and Cognitive Services, what’s next? Do you publish the solution for your stakeholders and users, give yourself a high five, and move on to the next project? Do you continue to iterate on this project for added value? Do you build upon the lessons from this book and dive deeper into ML <span class="No-Break">and OpenAI?</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Next steps for the FAA Wildlife Strike data solution</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker763"/> examples used in this book only scratch the surface of the different use cases that could be built out using the FAA Wildlife Strike database. In your real-world work, most people will never need to use FAA Wildlife Strike data. Even so, there is value in brainstorming possible next steps so that you can incorporate such thinking into your solutions. Without adding new data, a few examples might include, but not be limited to, <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Predicting the height of different bird species, at different times of the year, at <span class="No-Break">different locations</span></li>
				<li>Predicting the damage likelihood for different types <span class="No-Break">of aircraft</span></li>
				<li>Predicting seasonal risk rates for <span class="No-Break">wildlife strikes</span></li>
				<li>Evaluating the impact of Covid on wildlife strikes (fewer flights during <span class="No-Break">the pandemic)</span></li>
				<li>Assessing differences in wildlife strikes on aircraft with tail-mounted versus <span class="No-Break">wing-mounted engines</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Bringing in <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>external data might provide opportunities to enrich your <span class="No-Break">solution, too:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Weather data could be used as a factor for predicting different types of wildlife <span class="No-Break">strike criteria</span></li>
				<li>Data for all airline flights (most don’t have wildlife strikes) could be used to determine the rates of wildlife strikes and add more robust information <span class="No-Break">about flights</span></li>
				<li>Data about wildlife and bird deterrents (fences, decoys of predators, and so on) at airports could be added to assess <span class="No-Break">the effectiveness</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Iterating upon your existing ML models will most likely give you better results than those in the workshop, as will testing different features, evaluating different ranges of dates, bringing in newer data, testing new filter criteria. With Power BI, new tests are only a few clicks away. If you are able to get better results than the workshop, please share them! The ML models in this book were not intended to be perfect, but rather to give you a launching pad for getting started with <span class="No-Break">the technology.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Next steps with Power BI and ML</h2>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>you’ve built and deployed ML models in Power BI, what do you do next? Hopefully, this book has been a learning experience that not only enriched your skills with the Power BI toolset but also helped you learn the conceptual intersection of BI, ML, and AI (including OpenAI). In the modern era, tools such as Power BI will continue to evolve and improve over time. How should you plan to use Power BI ML moving forward? What other considerations might be good ideas <span class="No-Break">to consider?</span></p>
			<p>As shown back in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 14</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, Power BI is a suite of SaaS tools that are constantly evolving and improving. Power BI ML will inevitably evolve, too. The tools and techniques covered in this book should give you a foundation for understanding and adjusting to future changes to the product suite. You’ve hopefully learned a methodology to reveal use cases for ML, discover features to build ML models, and assess the possible utility of ML for those use cases within the context of <span class="No-Break">Power BI.</span></p>
			<p>Will Power BI ML be<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> the right tool for the next iteration of this project or for your next ML project? Maybe, maybe not! As discussed in previous chapters, the use cases for ML models developed in this book might be more impactful if the next round of improvements is done with the help of a data science team with enterprise-grade ML capabilities that go beyond the AutoML capabilities in Power BI ML. Or, perhaps a few more rounds of iterations in Power BI ML could also result in a better end product. In the long term, the design and architectural concepts from this book will hopefully provide longer-lasting value than the technical trainings for Power <span class="No-Break">BI ML.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Next steps for your career</h2>
			<p>Having completed <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>this book and the affiliated workshop using FAA Wildlife Strike data, hopefully you are excited about considering ML and AI as components for future projects. On your journey through this book, you started with raw data and built up to Power BI ML with OpenAI integration. The data that you used was not curated or optimized for this project but represented real data from the real world. What now? Well, hopefully, this experience can help you find new pathways to enhance <span class="No-Break">your career!</span></p>
			<p>If you are a Power BI and analytics enthusiast, you can now add ML as a new tool to your war chest. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>now leverage Power BI ML to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assess new ideas for solving problems for existing projects using <span class="No-Break">ML models</span></li>
				<li>Scope out the utility of data for larger <span class="No-Break">ML projects</span></li>
				<li>Use Power BI ML as a way to rapidly prototype ML models before sending the project along to a data <span class="No-Break">science team</span></li>
				<li>Impatiently await updates and new capabilities from Microsoft for ML in <span class="No-Break">Power BI</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have aspirations to become a data science professional, or if you already work in data science, you can use your learnings to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gain a better understanding of how to work with BI teams to collaborate and <span class="No-Break">solve problems</span></li>
				<li>Build out BI components of your solutions in <span class="No-Break">Power BI</span></li>
				<li>Assess the pros and cons of AutoML tools versus your traditional data <span class="No-Break">science toolbox</span></li>
				<li>Dive deeper into OpenAI and Azure OpenAI integration for <span class="No-Break">your projects</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>For a passionate <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>architect, a solution is never complete and there are always opportunities to add new data, approach problems from a new perspective, test new AI and ML tools, and improve upon the end <span class="No-Break">user experience.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you reviewed all of the lessons from the book and the affiliated workshop. Over the course of 13 chapters, you have traversed the intersection of BI, ML, AI, and OpenAI by way of a single use case. Beginning with raw FAA Wildlife Strike data, you built an end-to-end workshop using the affiliated Packt GitHub repository. Particular attention was given to Power BI ML, and then integration with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. The next steps and options for working with the FAA data were discussed. Options for future career plans were then covered in the context of the content in this book. In an age of rapid technological evolution, hopefully the architectural design process and strategies covered in this book will help you long after these tools have evolved beyond the state in which they were covered in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>Learning about Power BI ML in this book will hopefully open the door for you to find whatever is next in your career. It may be as a Power BI professional, a future data scientist, an industry analyst, or as a project manager. If nothing else, you will have a different perspective of your surrounding landscape the next time you gaze upon the world from a window seat on your next <span class="No-Break">airline flight.</span></p>
