			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you learned how to create the <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot using the <strong class="bold">Amazon Lex</strong> service. You are able to interact with the chatbot using natural language speech via a textbox, and the chatbot is able to query an external service API to get the information to send back to you.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will interact with the <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot using speech, rather than text. First, you will set up a call center within Amazon Connect, with a local phone number. Then, you will connect <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> to Amazon Connect. </p>
			<p>Finally, you will test the chatbot by speaking to it; this will be done by calling it. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to talk to your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> bot via a telephone interface, using the Amazon Connect interface.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Amazon Connect Basics</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Amazon Connect</strong> is a service from AWS that allows for the creation of cloud-based contact centers. This means that people can use a telephone number to contact the service and have conversations with bots or human representatives. In this case, we are primarily interested in automating interaction, using the chatbot that we built previously.</p>
			<p>Some key features of Amazon Connect are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is easy to set up and use Connect with workflows that are defined using a graphical editor.</li>
				<li>There is no infrastructure to deploy or manage, so contact centers can be scaled up and down quickly.</li>
				<li>It is a <strong class="bold">pay-as-you-go service</strong>, so there is no setup or monthly fees. We will be using the free tier, so we should not have to pay anything to use the service. For commercial usage, charges are based on per minute rates.</li>
				<li>Connect is deployed in 42 availability zones, within 16 geographic regions.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Free Tier Information</h3>
			<p>In this book, you will only be using the free tier of the services presented. However, it is important to be aware of the limits of free usage and pricing otherwise.</p>
			<p>You should check the official web-page https://aws.amazon.com/connect/. A single contact center may include a set amount of Amazon Connect service usage and a direct dial number including 60 minutes of inbound and outbound calls. This can change depending on your regional settings.</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">You should not need to go beyond the services provided by the free tier for this book. If you go beyond the limits of the free tier, you will get charged by Amazon, at the rates published at: <a href="">https://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Interacting with the Chatbot</h2>
			<p>Using Connect to interact with your chatbot by voice, requires that you first set up a call center within Connect. The call center receives a free local phone number (or a US toll-free number, in the United States). This number can be connected to an <strong class="bold">Amazon Lex</strong> chatbot; in our case, this will be the chatbot that we have already created (<strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong>). The chatbot uses the Lambda <strong class="keyword">serverless service</strong> to get data from an external API and relay it back to the user on the phone:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Talking to Your Chatbot through a Call Center using Amazon Connect</h2>
			<p>Using Amazon Connect, we can create a call center application that will allow us to connect to the chatbot which we built in the preceded chapter (<strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong>), using voice commands, rather than a textbox;</p>
			<p>To create an Amazon Connect call center, you make an Amazon Connect occurrence. Each example contains the majority of the assets and settings identified with your call focus. You can oversee settings for your scenario from the Amazon Connect support. You can oversee settings for your contact focus from inside your contact focus. </p>
			<p>You can make various occurrences; however, each example capacities just inside the AWS area in which you make it. Settings, clients, measurements, and details are not shared between Amazon Connect occasions.</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">It is mandatory to have an AWS Account. Amazon Lex services can be accessed through Console page.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Exercise 18: Creating a Personal Call Center</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will create a personal call center using Amazon Connect, and we will connect your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot to it. We have already discussed the Amazon Connect service in this chapter:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>For the first step, navigate to the Amazon Connect service page in the AWS Console. You can select the link to navigate to, or go directly to this URL: <a href="">https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect</a>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer194"><img alt="Figure 5.2: The Amazon Connect welcome screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0022.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.2: The Amazon Connect welcome screen</h6></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Get started</strong> button to create a new <strong class="bold">Call Center</strong>. In the first screen that follows, keep the default option of Store users within Amazon Connect, and enter a name for your application. The name is unique across AWS, and duplicates are not allowed, so you may have to experiment a bit or add numbers to the name until you get a name, which is unique.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next step</strong> button when you are done:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer195"><img alt="Figure 5.3: Step 1 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0033.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.3: Step 1 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen</h6></li>
				<li>In the next step, add the information for a new <strong class="inline">admin</strong>, <strong class="inline">setting</strong> the <strong class="inline">email address</strong> to your own email address. Again, click on the <strong class="bold">Next step</strong> button when you are done:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer196"><img alt="Figure 5.4: Step 2 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen" src="image/image0042.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.4: Step 2 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen</h6></li>
				<li>In the next step, leave the <strong class="bold">Incoming calls</strong> checkbox checked, and uncheck the <strong class="bold">Outbound calls</strong> checkbox:<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">We have no requirement for our bot to initiate a call to anyone, in this case, but we do want it to be able to receive calls.</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer197"><img alt="Figure 5.5: Step 3 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0053.jpg"/></div><h6> </h6><h6>Figure 5.5: Step 3 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen</h6></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Next step</strong> button when you are done.</li>
				<li>Next you will be presented with an informational screen, letting you know that you are granting the call center application permissions to read and write data to or from your S3 bucket, encrypt or decrypt data, and read and write to and from <strong class="inline">CloudWatch</strong> logs.</li>
				<li>It will also show you the location of the <strong class="inline">S3 buckets</strong> where your <strong class="inline">data</strong> and <strong class="inline">Contact flow</strong> logs will be stored:<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">Note that there is a <strong class="bold">Customize</strong> settings link to further customize these locations, but we will not use this.</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer198"><img alt="Figure 5.6: Step 4 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0062.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.6: Step 4 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen</h6></li>
				<li>This will bring you to the final screen, which will provide you with a review of all of the settings for your <strong class="bold">Contact center</strong> application:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer199"><img alt=" Figure 5.7: Step 5 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0072.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.7: Step 5 of the Amazon Connect resource configuration screen</h6></li>
				<li>Now, click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> <strong class="bold">Instance</strong> button to create your application. You should see a dialog window:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer200"><img alt="Figure 5.8: Amazon Connect setting up&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0083.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.8: Setting up Amazon Connect</h6></li>
				<li>In a minute or two, it will complete the setup process and take you to a <strong class="bold">Success</strong> screen, where you can click on the <strong class="bold">Get started</strong> button to go directly to your application:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer201"><img alt=" Figure 5.9: The Success screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0093.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.9: The Success screen</h6><h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">It may take up to 15 minutes for the application to get set up, so if you do not succeed in getting to the application page initially, have some patience and try again every once in a while until it does succeed.</p></li>
				<li>Typically, it should not take very long, and generally, the application page will be accessible right away.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-101">Exercise <a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>19: Obtaining a Free Phone Number for your Call Center</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will acquire a free number for our custom call center. The free telephone number can be acquired by the free tier services provided by Amazon Connect. The following are the steps for completion for obtaining the free number:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The welcome screen for your personal call center should be visible, and, if it is not, you can access it easily at the <strong class="inline">URL</strong> displayed within the previous screen, right before you click on the <strong class="bold">Get Started</strong> button:<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">In my case, it was <a href="">https://mymarketnanny.awsapps.com/connect</a>; in yours, it will be based on your own application's name.</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer202"><img alt="Figure 5.10: The Amazon Connect welcome screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0102.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.10: The Amazon Connect welcome screen</h6></li>
				<li>At this point, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Let's go</strong> button, in order to initiate the first step, which is to claim a <strong class="inline">local</strong> phone number for your call center application. On this screen, you can select your country:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer203"><img alt="Figure 5.11: The Claim phone number screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0113.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.11: The Claim phone number screen</h6></li>
				<li>Leave the <strong class="bold">Type</strong> as the <strong class="bold">default</strong> (Direct Dial) option, and, from the Phone number drop-down menu, select a phone number. This should be, in most cases, a number that is local to you. If you choose one that is not, you may be charged, based on the cost to dial the number:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer204"><img alt=" Figure 5.12: Phone number selection&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0122.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.12: Phone number selection</h6></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next </strong>button when you are done. This will allow you to test your new phone number by dialing it. You should hear a message that starts with <strong class="bold">Hello</strong>, thanks for calling. These are some examples of what the Amazon Connect virtual contact center can enable you to do</li>
				<li>This will be followed by a list of options; you can try them for yourself to see what they do when you have some time. For now, click on the <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> button, which will bring you to the <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong> screen:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer205"><img alt="Figure 5.13: The Amazon Connect Dashboard screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0133.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.13: The Amazon Connect Dashboard screen</h6></li>
				<li>You now have a working call center application on Amazon Connect. </li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Using Amazon Lex Chatbots with Amazon Connect</h2>
			<p>With Amazon Lex, you can create intelligent chatbots. This can be done by converting contact flows into regular conversations. The Amazon Connect service compliments the forementioned feature by enabling the creation of a contact center (cloud base) along with the generation of dynamic flows. This delivers a personalized experience to your callers. Additionally, <strong class="bold">Dual-tone multi-frequency</strong> (<strong class="bold">DTMF</strong>) digits entered by callers during a call can be easily recognized by these chatbots.</p>
			<p>With both Amazon Lex and Amazon Connect working in sync, the chatbot can gauge the callers’ intent. Furthermore, you can use the AWS Lambda function along with your chatbot for processing caller requests, providing information to callers, and querying applications. These chatbots are capable of maintaining context by intelligently managing dialogue and review replies based on callers’ responses on the fly.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will connect your <em class="italics">MarketNanny</em> chatbot to the call center, so that the user can speak into the phone and have his or her speech automatically converted to a text utterance that will get sent to the Lex chatbot. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Understanding Contact Flows</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">contact flow</strong> defines each step of the experience that customers have when they interact with your call center. You can create a contact flow by using the contact flow templates provided. You can also create your own contact flow from scratch, by using the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> contact flow editor.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Contact</strong> flow designer screen provides a way to visually create contact flows in a drag and drop environment. Contact flows are made of nodes that can be accessed in the left panel, within the designer area (under the Show additional flow information link).</p>
			<p>Nodes are categorized under the <strong class="inline">Interact</strong>, <strong class="inline">Set</strong>, <strong class="inline">Branch</strong>, <strong class="inline">Integrate</strong>, and <strong class="inline">Terminate</strong>/<strong class="inline">Transfer</strong> categories. Nodes in each category can be hidden or revealed by clicking on the drop-down icon next to the section name. You will explore some of the nodes that are available by creating the contact flow for your chatbot.</p>
			<p>Contact flows are a way for users (typically supervisors) to progressively refresh the settings for each call entering the framework and ensure that the users hear customized and pertinent choices. While there are a number of predesigned contact flows, you will create a new one for your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Contact Flow Templates </h3>
			<p>The following are the templates that are available:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer queue flow</strong>: Manages what the customer experiences while in that queue, before being joined to an agent. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer hold flow</strong>: Manages what the customer experiences while the customer is on hold. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer whisper flow</strong>: Manages what the customer experiences as a part of an inbound call,immediately before being joined with an agent.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outbound whisper flow</strong>: Manages what the customer experiences as a part of an outbound call, before being connected with an agent. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agent hold flow</strong>: Oversees what the specialist encounters when on hold with a client. With this stream, at least one sound prompt can be played to a specialist utilizing the Loop prompts square while the client is on hold.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agent whisper flow</strong>: Manages what the agent experiences as a part of an inbound call, immediately before being joined with a customer. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transfer to agent flow</strong>: Manages what the agent experiences when transferring to another agent. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transfer to queue flow</strong>: Manages what the agent experiences when transferring to another queue.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we will set up your call center so that it can accept incoming calls, connect your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot to the call center so that the user can speak into the phone, and have the user's speech automatically converted to a text utterance that will be sent to the Lex chatbot.</p>
			<p>The chatbot then continues with processing the utterance, finding the intent, and slots and fulfilling it through the Lambda function you had set up in the preceded section. </p>
			<p>In order to connect your call center Instance with your chatbot, you will need to go back to the main screen (not the Dashboard) briefly. Select the link for the <strong class="inline">Contact</strong> flows.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Exercise 20: Connect the Call Center to Your Lex Chatbot</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, you will set up your call center so that it can accept incoming calls, and so that you can connect your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot to the call center. The following are the steps for completion:</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">This is not the previous screen with the Dashboard. You may find a Contact flows entry there, as well, but it is not the one we're interested in.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Here, you will find a section titled Amazon Lex, with a drop-down under Lex bots. Click on the dropdown to find the <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> bot as an entry, and select it, and then select the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> Lex Bots link to save it:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer206"><img alt=" Figure 5.14: The Contact flows screen with the Lex bots selection dropdown&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0142.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.14: The Contact flows screen with the Lex bots selection dropdown</h6></li>
				<li>Now, you can navigate back to the <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong> screen by selecting the <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> link and clicking on the Login as <strong class="bold">administrator</strong> button. The <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong> screen will open in a new browser tab:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer207"><img alt=" Figure 5.15: The Login as administrator screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0153.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.15: The Login as administrator screen</h6></li>
				<li>On the Dashboard screen, select the <strong class="bold">Routing</strong> icon, and when it opens, select <strong class="bold">Contact flows</strong>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer208"><img alt="Figure 5.16: Selecting Routing, Contact flows from the Dashboard&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0162.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.16: Selecting Routing and Contact flows from the Dashboard</h6></li>
				<li>This will bring you to a <strong class="bold">Contact</strong> <strong class="bold">flows</strong> screen than the one we were just on previously. This screen is the <strong class="bold">Contact flow designer</strong>, where you can design and create <strong class="bold">New</strong> contact flows:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer209"><img alt="Figure 5.17: Contact flows screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0173.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.17: Contact flows screen</h6></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> contact flow button in the upper right of the page to create a new contact flow. Name it <strong class="inline">MarketNannyFlow</strong>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer210"><img alt="Figure 5.18: The Contact flow designer screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0182.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.18: The Contact flow designer screen</h6></li>
				<li>The first node that you will use for your chatbot's contact flow is the <strong class="bold">Set voice</strong> node. You can find it under the <strong class="bold">Set</strong> category and drag it to the graphical view to the right of the <strong class="bold">Entry point</strong> node, which is already in the view.</li>
				<li>Connect the output of the Entry point node with the input of the <strong class="bold">Set voice</strong> node by clicking on the output circle and dragging with your mouse to the input bump on the left of the <strong class="bold">Set voice</strong> node:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer211"><img alt=" Figure 5.19: The Contact flow designer screen with Set voice node&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0193.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.19: The Contact flow designer screen with Set voice node</h6></li>
				<li>Next, you can set the properties of the node by clicking on the top of the node. This will bring up a panel on the right-hand side of the screen, with the relevant properties that you can set.</li>
				<li>For this component, it provides <strong class="bold">Language</strong> and <strong class="bold">Voice</strong> properties, both of which can be set by selecting a value from the dropdown under each property label. You can set the values appropriate to your scenario, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer212"><img alt="Figure 5.20: Properties for Set Voice node&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0202.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.20: Properties for Set Voice node</h6></li>
				<li>The next node to add is the <strong class="bold">Get customer input</strong> node, which you will find under the Interact tab. You can connect the input of this node to the output of the <strong class="bold">Set voice</strong> node, just like when you connected <strong class="bold">Set voice</strong> to the Entry point node:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer213"><img alt="Figure 5.21: Adding the Get customer input node" src="image/image0213.jpg"/></div><h6> Figure 5.21: Adding the Get customer input node</h6></li>
				<li>First, select the <strong class="inline">Text</strong> <strong class="inline">to</strong> <strong class="inline">speech</strong> (ad hoc) option and click on <strong class="bold">Enter</strong> text under it. In the input textbox, enter a greeting such as the following:<p class="snippet">Hi this is the Market Nanny chatbot. How may I help you today?</p><h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">Feel free to replace this with some other text that may be more interesting or appropriate for you.</p></li>
				<li>This is the text that will be converted to a voice greeting when the <strong class="bold">Contact center</strong> application first answers the phone:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer214"><img alt="Figure 5.22: Get customer input properties&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0222.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.22: Get customer input properties</h6></li>
				<li>Next, scroll down the setting pane and select the Amazon Lex subsection, and not the <strong class="inline">DTMF</strong> section. Here, you will be able to configure the node to work with your chatbot.<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">The DTMF section provides a way to specify interactions with the caller via button presses on his/her phone, but we will not cover that today. We are much more interested in having our chatbot interact with the caller!</p></li>
				<li>In this section, under Lex bot, you can enter the name and alias for your chatbot. Under Name, enter <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong>, and under <strong class="bold">Alias</strong>, enter <strong class="inline">$LATEST</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="inline">$LATEST</strong> is a system-defined alias which specifies that the contact center will always access the most recently published version of the <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer215"><img alt="Figure 5.23: Amazon Lex properties in the Get customer input properties&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0233.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.23: Amazon Lex properties in the Get customer input properties</h6></li>
				<li>Finally, specify the <strong class="inline">GetQuote</strong> intent under the Intents section. Since that is the only intent we are currently working with, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer216"><img alt="Figure 5.24: The GetQuote intent in Get customer input node&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0242.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.24: The GetQuote intent in Get customer input node</h6></li>
				<li>You can now see that the <strong class="bold">Get customer input</strong> node has changed to display the intent that we specified in its properties pane:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer217"><img alt="Figure 5.25: Full contact center flow&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0253.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.25: Full contact center flow</h6></li>
				<li>You can finish the flow by adding two more nodes:<ul><li><strong class="inline">Play</strong> prompt from the <strong class="inline">Interac</strong>t section. Set the Prompt property to Text to speech (ad hoc) in the property pane, and enter text in the textbox under Enter text as follows:<p class="snippet">"Thanks for using <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong>" Feel free to ask me something else.</p></li><li><strong class="inline">Disconnect</strong>/<strong class="inline">hang up</strong> from the <strong class="inline">Terminate</strong>/<strong class="inline">Transfer</strong> section. Do not set any properties.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Connect the nodes, as shown previously.</li>
				<li>Connect the outputs of the Default and Error states in <strong class="bold">Get customer input</strong> to the input of the <strong class="bold">Disconnect</strong>/<strong class="bold">Hang up</strong> node.</li>
				<li>Connect the <strong class="inline">GetQuote</strong> output to the Play prompt node.</li>
				<li>Connect the output from <strong class="inline">Play</strong> prompt to the input of <strong class="bold">Set</strong> voice. This ensures that you can interact with your chatbot for as long as you keep asking the right questions.</li>
				<li>Finally, click on the dropdown icon next to the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button in the upper right of the screen, and select <strong class="bold">Save and Publish</strong> to publish the contact flow:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer218"><img alt="Figure 5.26: Save and Publish section&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0261.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.26: Save and Publish section</h6></li>
				<li>As the final step, you will connect your call center phone number to the new contact flow you have just created.</li>
				<li>From the menu panel on the left-hand side of the screen, select the <strong class="bold">Routing</strong> menu, and from that, select the <strong class="bold">Phone numbers</strong> item:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer219"><img alt="Figure 5.27: Selecting Routing, Phone numbers from the Dashboard&#13;&#10;" src="image/image0274.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.27: Selecting Routing and Phone numbers from the Dashboard</h6></li>
				<li>This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Manage Phone</strong> numbers screen, where you can select the phone number that you wish to use for <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong>.</li>
				<li>Selecting the phone number will bring you to the Edit Phone number page:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer220"><img alt="Figure 5.28: The Edit Phone number screen" src="image/image0282.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 5.28: The Edit Phone number screen</h6></li>
				<li>Here, click on the dropdown under <strong class="bold">Contact flow</strong>/<strong class="bold">IVR</strong> and select or type the name of your new contact flow: <strong class="inline">MarketNannyFlow</strong>.</li>
				<li>Call your contact center phone number to verify that you can interact with your <strong class="inline">MarketNanny</strong> chatbot by speaking to it!</li>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Activity 1: Creating a Custom Bot and Connecting the Bot with Amazon Connect</h3>
			<p>In this activity, we will create an <strong class="bold">Amazon Lex</strong> bot for checking the <strong class="bold">Account Balance</strong>. The bot will check the account balance. An <strong class="bold">Amazon Lex</strong> bot is controlled via <strong class="bold">Automatic Speech Recognition</strong> (<strong class="bold">ASR</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Natural Language Understanding</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLU</strong>) capacities, a similar innovation that forces Amazon Alexa. For this, we will consider the following example: suppose a user wants to check their account balance; a user might use <strong class="bold">I want to check my account balance</strong>. You can configure the intent to of the Amazon Lex bot to an Amazon Connect Instance. You can create a contact flow and add your Amazon Lex bot. To ensure that this happens correctly, you will need to navigate to the Amazon Lex services and Amazon Connect services for connecting the bot:</p>
