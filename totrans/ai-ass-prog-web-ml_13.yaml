- en: In the realm of data-driven decision making, understanding customer behavior
    is pivotal for optimizing business strategies. Building on our exploration of
    classification techniques, this chapter shifts focus to regression analysis, specifically
    linear regression, to predict numerical values such as a customer’s annual spending.
    Linear regression helps us discover relationships within data, enabling predictions
    based on observed patterns.

    that estimates annual spending by customers based on their interactions with a
    digital platform. We aim to deepen your understanding of linear regression, demonstrating
    how to prepare, process, and utilize datasets to construct accurate and reliable
    models.

    various customer attributes and their purchasing patterns, the store aims to tailor

    yearly spending and other parameters. **Regression** is a way to find out whether
    and how different factors (like time spent on an app or website) relate to how
    much customers spend in the online store. It helps us understand and predict customer
    behavior. By understanding which factors are most influential in driving sales,
    an e-commerce store can tailor its strategies to enhance these areas and potentially
    increase revenue.

    the model’s performance. Overfitting occurs when the model learns to capture noise
    or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than the underlying relationships
    between the input features and the target variable. This can result in a model
    that performs well on the training data but generalizes poorly to unseen data.

    relative to the size of the training data are more prone to overfitting. Linear

    of overfitting.'

    regression models, employing both ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus for rapid analysis
    and predictive tasks. This approach is particularly valuable in the early stages
    of machine learning development, offering immediate insights and the flexibility
    to experiment with different models or algorithms without the burden of managing
    execution environments or programming instances. Additionally, we learned how
    to effectively utilize single prompts for generating comprehensive code. While
    it’s possible to craft prompts for discrete tasks or steps, many of these require
    only succinct lines of code and were not the focus here. Providing feedback is
    instrumental in this process, and validating the output is crucial to ensure the
    code’s functionality.
