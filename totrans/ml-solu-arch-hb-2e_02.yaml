    of different businesses to have effective conversations with business and technology
    leaders. This should not come as a surprise since the ultimate goal of any ML
    solutions architecture is to solve practical business problems with science and
    technology solutions. Therefore, one of the main areas of focus for ML solutions
    architecture is to develop a broad understanding of different business domains,
    workflows, and relevant data. Without this understanding, it would be challenging
    to make sense of the data and design and develop practical ML solutions for business

    documents. Specifically, **named entity recognition** (**NER**) techniques can
