    of different businesses to have effective conversations with business and technology
    leaders. This should not come as a surprise since the ultimate goal of any ML
    solutions architecture is to solve practical business problems with science and
    technology solutions. Therefore, one of the main areas of focus for ML solutions
    architecture is to develop a broad understanding of different business domains,
    workflows, and relevant data. Without this understanding, it would be challenging
    to make sense of the data and design and develop practical ML solutions for business
    problems.

    industry verticals. We will examine the key business workflows and challenges
    faced by industries such as financial services and retail, and how ML technologies
    can help solve these challenges. The aim of this chapter is not to make you an
    expert in any particular industry or its ML use cases and techniques but rather
    to expose you to real-world ML use cases in business contexts and workflows. After
    reading this chapter, you will be equipped to apply similar analytical thinking
    regarding ML solutions in your own line of business. You will gain perspective
    on identifying and evaluating where ML technology can provide value in your workflows,
    processes, and objectives. The cross-industry examples and scenarios are intended
    to spark ideas for how ML could address your unique business challenges, and broaden
    your thinking about ML opportunities.

    of technological innovation, and ML adoption is no exception. In recent years,
    we have seen a range of ML solutions being implemented across different business
    functions within financial services. For example, in capital markets, ML is being
    used across front, middle, and back offices to aid investment decisions, trade
    optimization, risk management, and transaction settlement processing. In insurance,
    companies are using ML to streamline underwriting, prevent fraud, and automate
    claim management. While in banking, banks are using it to improve customer experience,
    combat fraud, and facilitate loan approval decisions. In the following sections,
    we will explore different core business areas within financial services and how
    ML can be applied to overcome some of these business challenges.

    discover patterns to inform trading strategies, such as pair trading, using data
    points such as company fundamentals, trading patterns, and technical indicators.
    In trade execution, ML models can help estimate trading costs and identify optimal
    trading execution strategies and execution paths to minimize costs and optimize
    profits. Financial services companies generate massive amounts of time series
    data, such as the prices of different financial instruments, which can be used
    to discover market signals and estimate market trends. As a result, ML has been
    adopted for use cases such as financial time series classification and forecasting
    financial instruments and economic indicators.

    data (annual reports, filing, news, and internal documents). Typical junior bankers
    spend many hours searching for documents that might contain useful information
    and manually extracting information from the documents to prepare pitch books
    or perform financial modeling. To tackle this labor-intensive problem, investment
    banks have been exploring and adopting ML solutions. One such solution is using
    NLP to extract structured tabular data automatically from large amounts of PDF
    documents. Specifically, **named entity recognition** (**NER**) techniques can
    help with automatic entity extraction from documents. ML-based reading comprehension
    and question-answering technology can assist bankers in finding relevant information
    from large volumes of text quickly and accurately using natural human questions
    instead of simple text string matching. Documents can also be automatically tagged
    with metadata and classified using the ML technique to improve document management

- en: Online shopping has simplified the purchasing process for consumers, but searching
    for a product online can sometimes be difficult when you only have a picture and
    no information on the item’s name or features. This is where deep learning-powered
    visual search technology comes in handy. This technology allows consumers to quickly
    identify similar-looking products by simply uploading a picture of the item they
    are looking for. Visual search technology works by creating a digital representation
    of the item’s pictures, also known as encoding or embedding, and storing it in
    a high-performance item index. When a shopper needs to find a similar-looking
    item using a picture, the new picture is encoded into a digital representation
    and searched against the item index using an efficient distance-based comparison.
    The system then returns the items that are closest to the target item.

    direct marketing emails or digital advertisements, to attract potential customers
    with incentives or discounts based on their demographics. The success of such
    campaigns relies heavily on effectively targeting the right customers to achieve
    a high conversion rate while minimizing advertising costs and reducing customer
    disturbances. ML models have been developed to optimize the effectiveness of marketing
    campaigns. These models use customer data and various demographic factors to identify
    potential customers who are most likely to convert, as well as to determine the
    most appropriate messaging and incentives for each customer segment. By leveraging
    ML techniques, retailers can improve the accuracy and efficiency of their marketing

    media data. Highly personalized campaigns with customized marketing messages can
    be generated using these personal profiles for a higher conversion rate. The ML
    approach to user-centric targeted marketing predicts the conversion rate, such
    as the **click-through rate** (**CTR**), for different users and sends ads to
    users with a high conversion rate. This can be a classification or regression
    problem by learning the relationship between the user features and the probability

    are relevant to the content on a web page. It involves placing display or video
    ads on websites that match the advertisement’s content, which can improve the
    ad’s effectiveness. For instance, a cooking product advertisement may be placed
    on a cooking recipe website to reach a highly engaged audience. ML can assist
    with identifying the context of an ad to ensure it is placed appropriately. For
    instance, computer vision models can analyze video ads to detect objects, people,
    and themes to extract contextual information and match them to the website’s content.
