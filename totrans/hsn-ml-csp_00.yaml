- en: In our daily work, which is predominantly information technology, the necessity
    of machine learning is everywhere and is demanded by all developers, programmers,
    and analysts. But why use C# for machine learning? The answer is, most production
    enterprise applications are written in C# using tools such as Visual Studio, SQL
    Server, Unity, and Microsoft Azure.

- en: This book provides an intuitive understanding of various concepts, the techniques
    of machine learning, and various machine learning tools through which users can
    add intelligent features such as image and motion detection, Bayes intuition,
    deep learning and belief, and more to C# .NET applications.

- en: Using this book, you will implement supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
    and will be well equipped to create good predictive models. You will learn numerous
    techniques and algorithms, right from simple linear regression, decision trees,
    and SVM to advanced concepts such as artificial neural networks, autoencoders,
    and reinforcement learning.
