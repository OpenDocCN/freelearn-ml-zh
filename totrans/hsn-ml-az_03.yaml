- en: Cognitive Services are a set of pre-trained APIs from Microsoft that allow developers
    to develop applications that use AI without having to build ML models. With their
    support for edge deployment, developers can build applications that use powerful
    AI algorithms to interpret, listen, speak, and see on devices such as a drone.

    in the image. This might include the main subject, the setting (indoor or outdoor),
    furniture, tools, plants, animals, accessories, and gadgets.
