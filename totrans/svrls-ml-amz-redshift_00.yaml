- en: Amazon Redshift Serverless enables organizations to run petabyte-scale cloud
    data warehouses quickly and in a cost-effective way, enabling data science professionals
    to efficiently deploy cloud data warehouses and leverage easy-to-use tools to
    train models and run predictions. This practical guide will help developers and
    data professionals working with Amazon Redshift data warehouses to put their SQL
    knowledge to work for training and deploying machine learning models.

- en: The book begins by helping you to explore the inner workings of Redshift Serverless
    as well as the foundations of data analytics and types of data machine learning.
    With the help of step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical
    examples, you’ll then learn to build your own classification and regression models.
    As you advance, you’ll find out how to deploy various types of machine learning
    projects using familiar SQL code, before delving into Redshift ML. In the concluding
    chapters, you’ll discover best practices for implementing serverless architecture
    with Redshift.
