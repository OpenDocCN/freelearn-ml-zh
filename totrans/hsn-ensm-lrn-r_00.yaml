- en: Ensemble learning! This specialized topic of machine learning broadly deals
    with putting together multiple models with the aim of providing higher accuracy
    and stable model performance. The ensemble methodology is based on sound theory
    and its usage has seen successful applications in complex data science scenarios.
    This book grabs the opportunity of dealing with this important topic.

- en: Moderately sized datasets are used throughout the book. All the concepts—well,
    most of them—have been illustrated using the software, and R packages have been
    liberally used to drive home the point. While care has been taken to ensure that
    all the codes are error free, please feel free to write us with any bugs or errors
    in the codes. The approach has been mildly validated through two mini-courses
    based on earlier drafts. The material was well received by my colleagues and that
    gave me enough confidence to complete the book.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0012_split_000.html#BE6O2-2006c10fab20488594398dc4871637ee
    "Chapter 1. Introduction to Ensemble Techniques"), *Introduction to Ensemble Techniques*,
    will give an exposition to the need for ensemble learning, important datasets,
    essential statistical and machine learning models, and important statistical tests.
    This chapter displays the spirit of the book.'

    "Chapter 2. Bootstrapping"), *Bootstrapping*, will introduce the two important
    concepts of jackknife and bootstrap. The chapter will help you carry out statistical
    inference related to unknown complex parameters. Bootstrapping of essential statistical
    models, such as linear regression, survival, and time series, is illustrated through
    R programs. More importantly, it lays the basis for resampling techniques that
    forms the core of ensemble methods.'

    "Chapter 3. Bagging"), *Bagging*, will propose the first ensemble method of using
    a decision tree as a base model. Bagging is a combination of the words *bootstrap
    aggregation.* Pruning of decision trees is illustrated, and it will lay down the
    required foundation for later chapters. Bagging of decision trees and k-NN classifiers
    are illustrated in this chapter.'

    "Chapter 4. Random Forests"), *Random Forests*, will discuss the important ensemble
    extension of decision trees. Variable importance and proximity plots are two important
    components of random forests, and we carry out the related computations about
    them. The nuances of random forests are explained in depth. Comparison with the
    bagging method, missing data imputation, and clustering with random forests are
    also dealt with in this chapter.'

    "Chapter 5. The Bare Bones Boosting Algorithms"), *The Bare-Bones Boosting Algorithms*,
    will first state the boosting algorithm. Using toy data, the chapter will then
    explain the detailed computations of the adaptive boosting algorithm. Gradient
    boosting algorithm is then illustrated for the regression problem. The use of
    the `gbm` and `adabag` packages shows implementations of other boosting algorithms.
    The chapter concludes with a comparison of the bagging, random forest, and boosting
    methods.'

    explanation of the working of the boosting technique. The gradient boosting algorithm
    is then extended to count and survival datasets. The extreme gradient boosting
    implementation of the popular gradient boosting algorithm details are exhibited
    with clear programs. The chapter concludes with an outline of the important `h2o`
    package.'

    discuss in detail the use of ensemble methods in regression problems. A complex
    housing dataset from `kaggle` is used here. The regression data is modeled with
    multiple base learners. Bagging, random forest, boosting, and stacking are all
    illustrated for the regression data.'

    survival data is taken up. Survival analysis concepts are developed in considerable
    detail, and the traditional techniques are illustrated. The machine learning method
    of a survival tree is introduced, and then we build the ensemble method of random
    survival forests for this data structure.'
