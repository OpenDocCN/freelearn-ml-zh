    steps in an ML project. If you want to clean data and build derived features or
    select an ML algorithm to predict a target variable in your dataset, then you
    need to understand your data first. Your data will define many of the necessary
    cleaning and preprocessing steps; it will define which algorithms you can choose,
    and it will ultimately define the performance of your predictive model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, data exploration should be considered an important analytical step to
    understanding whether your data is informative enough to build an ML model in
    the first place. By analytical step, we mean that the exploration should be done
    as a structured analytical process rather than a set of experimental tasks. Therefore,
    we will go through a checklist of data exploration tasks that you can perform
    as an initial step in every ML project – before you start any data cleaning, preprocessing,
    feature engineering, or model selection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with. A lot of datasets will come in the form of tabular data, which means we
    have either continuous or categorical features defined for each instance of the
    dataset. These datasets can be visualized as a table, and we can perform basic
    and complex mathematical operations on them. The other general type of dataset
    we may encounter will come in the form of media files. This includes images, videos,
    sound files, documents, and anything else that is not made up of data points that
    you could fit into a table structure.

    of areas where specialized knowledge is needed to understand the data at hand.
    Imagine that you want to increase the yield of a blast furnace creating steel.
    In such a scenario, to understand the data, you need to have intimate knowledge
    of the chemical processes in the furnace, or you need a **subject matter expert**

    On the other hand, if we were to predict if an email is spam or not and we have
    a dataset that contains a bunch of emails containing a lot of metadata, this might

    is an extremely time-consuming task. However, instead of randomly exploring feature
    dimensions, you can analyze the dimensions ordered by feature importance and significantly
    reduce your time working through the data. Like many other areas of computer science,
    it is good to use an 80/20 principle for the initial data exploration, which means
    using only 20% of the features to achieve 80% of the performance. This sets you

    the transformation in such a way that the resulting directions have the highest
    inter-cluster variance and the lowest intra-cluster variance. This means that

    The data is centered around 0 and the directions are ordered by their highest

    target labels into account. Both LDA and PCA have no real tuning knobs, besides
    the number of components we want to keep in the projection and probably a random
