- en: I started my first deep dive into **machine learning** (**ML**) back in 2008
    when I was developing algorithms for adaptive traction control systems for electric
    cars. Shortly thereafter, I moved out of the mechanical engineering field and
    co-founded a marketing technology startup. Within a few weeks, I realized how
    important ML was going to be for me and my company, and I decided to read every
    book and paper on ML that I could find.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I spent the next couple of years with my nose to the grindstone, reading dozens
    of textbooks and hundreds of academic papers, writing every algorithm I could
    find from scratch, and slowly developing an intuition and philosophy around ML.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During that period, I discovered a few things about the ML ecosystem that I
    wasn't too happy with. There was a strong culture of gatekeeping at the time.
    The idea of writing ML in a language other than Python was considered absurd.
    There was a sentiment that only people who had gone to school to study ML could
    possibly be successful in the field. Much of the publicly available reading material,
    such as blog articles and tutorials online, was written in a distinctly mathematical
    tone, thereby alienating readers who were unfamiliar with linear algebra and vector
    calculus.

- en: At the same time, I was teaching a **JavaScript** (**JS**) programming bootcamp
    and many of my students—self-taught web developers—expressed an interest in ML.
    It was difficult for me to point them in the right direction; their only option
    at the time was to move to Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was frustrating to me because I knew that my students were smart enough
    to grasp ML, and I also knew that ML didn't need to be confined to Python. I also
    got the sense that many of the developers using the popular Python libraries didn't
    actually understand the mechanism of the algorithms and would run into problems
    when trying to implement them. The gatekeeping had backfired and only served to
    reduce this powerful family of algorithms into black boxes that were applied carelessly
    by developers that were discouraged from digging deeper and learning more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wanted to prove to the world that ML could be taught to anyone and written
    in any language, so I started writing a series of articles called *Machine Learning
    in JavaScript*. The articles taught ML algorithms from first principles, free
    of jargon and with a focus on implementation rather than mathematical description.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I chose JS for a few reasons. First, the lack of ML libraries in JS would force
    my readers to write their own implementations and discover for themselves that
    ML isn''t magic, just code. Second, JS hadn''t truly come into its own yet (Node.js
    didn''t exist at the time) and was generally considered a poor choice of programming
    language for serious problems, but I wanted to prove that ML could be written
    in *any *language. Finally, I wanted to use a language that most web developers,
    particularly self-taught developers, would be comfortable with. Choosing a backend
    language such as PHP or Java would mean excluding a large portion of developers,
    so I chose the language that every web developer knows: JS.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The series, though dated now, was a hit. Over a million people have read my
    articles, and I have heard from many readers that my articles inspired them to
    start on a new path; I consider this among my greatest professional successes.

- en: This book is a humble and modern update to my *Machine Learning in JavaScript*
    series. Much has changed since 2008\. JS is now the most popular programming language,
    and ML is being rapidly democratized. Developers can use AWS or Google Cloud to
    summon immense computational resources with a single API call, and the smartphones
    of today rival the processing power of desktop computers from a decade ago.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly to my old article series, this book will teach you ML algorithms from
    first principles. We'll focus on developing the concepts and implementations of
    ML without straying too far into the mathematical description. Unlike the old
    series, however, the JS landscape of today actually has ML libraries and implementations
    available. At times, therefore, we will write our own algorithms and at other
    times we will rely on existing libraries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of this book is not to teach you every ML algorithm that exists, nor
    to make you an expert in any one algorithm. Instead, my goal is to teach you,
    an experienced web developer, what you need to know to get started and get comfortable
    with ML so that you can begin your own educational journey with confidence.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for experienced JS developers who want to get started with ML.
    In general, I will assume that you are a competent JS developer with little to
    no experience with ML or mathematics beyond what you would learn in high school.
    In terms of JS abilities, you should already be familiar with the basic concepts
    of algorithms, modular code, and data transformations. I also assume that you
    can read JS code and understand both the intent and the mechanism.

- en: This book is not intended for novice programmers, though you still may be able
    to get something out of it. This book is also not intended for readers who are
    already comfortable with ML, as most of the content will be familiar to you—though
    there may be some small nuggets of wisdom that could be helpful to you in these
    pages.

- en: This book is perfect for you if you want to step into the ML landscape but don't
    know where to start in a vast and confusing ecosystem. Whether you're looking
    to make a shift in your career or simply learning something new, I believe you
    will find this book helpful.

- en: If you haven't programmed in JS in a while, it would be best for you to give
    yourself a refresher before you get started. In particular, the examples in this
    book will use ES6/ES2015 syntax; I will give you a tour of the new syntax in the
    first chapter, but you may also want to become familiar with it on your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you'll want to install that now. The
    examples in this book were written using Node.js version 9.6.0, though I expect
    most of the examples to work for any Node.js version greater than 8 and for Node.js
    version 10 as well.

- en: You will not need much education in math to get through this book, but I assume
    that you paid attention to your high school math courses. If you don't remember
    much probability, statistics, or algebra, you may want to refresh yourself on
    those topics, as they are prevalent in ML. While I have tried my best to avoid
    deep dives into advanced mathematical concepts, I will indeed have to present
    some in this book so that you at least get a level of comfort with math and the
    willingness to research some select mathematical concepts on your own.
