- en: In reinforced learning, a reward (or punishment) system is employed to impact
    behavior over time, based on interactions between an agent and its wider environment.
    An agent will receive state information from the environment and, based on that
    state, will perform an *action*. As a result of that action, the environment will
    transition to a new state that is then provided back to the agent, typically with
    a reward (or punishment). The goal of the agent is to therefore maximize the cumulative
    reward it receives. For example, consider the case of a child learning good behavior
    from bad behavior and being rewarded for good behavior with a treat from its parents.
    In the case of machines, consider the example of computer-based board game players.
    By combining deep learning with reinforced learning, computers can learn how to
    play board games with continually increasing levels of performance such that,
    over time, they become almost unbeatable!

    cell functions, producing the proteins required to build new dendrites and for
    making the neurotransmitter chemicals used as signals. Signals can be classed
    as either inhibitory or excitatory. If they are inhibitory, this means that they
    are not transmitted to other neurons. If they are excitatory, this means that
    they are transmitted to other neurons via the axon. The axon is responsible for
    communicating signals between neurons, in some cases across distances as long
    as a couple of meters or a short as a few microns. The neuron therefore, as a
    single logical unit, is ultimately responsible for communicating information and

    models. Common pre-processing techniques include **tokenization** (splitting text
    into smaller and simpler units called tokens, where tokens are often individual
    words or terms), **stemming** and **lemmatisation** (reducing tokens to a base
    form), and removing **stop-words** (such as *I*, *this*, and *at*). The resultant
    set of terms is converted into features to then feed into machine learning models.
    A very basic algorithm used to convert the set of terms into features is called
    **Bag of Words**, which simply counts the number of occurrences of each unique
    term, thereby converting text into numeric feature vectors.

    between artificially intelligent systems/machines and humans, such as through
    conversation interfaces. We will study NLP in more detail in [Chapter 6](2ad42c13-b5a3-40f6-9940-5316ff6a0451.xhtml), *Natural
    Language Processing Using Apache Spark*, including the hands-on development of

    science disciplines, including machine learning, deep learning, NLP, statistics,
    business intelligence, data engineering, and information retrieval that, together,
    are used to develop systems that simulate human thought processes. Real-world
    implementations of cognitive systems include chatbots and virtual assistants (such
    as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana) that understand natural
    human language and provide contextual conversation interfaces, including question-answering,
    personalized recommendations, and information retrieval systems.

    implement the algorithms that we have previously discussed by taking a look at
    how its machine learning library, `MLlib`, works under the hood. `MLlib` provides
    a suite of tools designed to make machine learning accessible, scalable, and easy
    to deploy.

    The examples in this book will use the DataFrame-based API, which is now the primary
    API for `MLlib`. For more information, please visit [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html).

    1](57c527fc-2555-49e9-bf1c-0567d05da388.xhtml), *The Big Data Ecosystem*) into
    another DataFrame. The new DataFrame will typically contain one or more new columns
    appended to it. In the context of a machine learning model, an input DataFrame
    may consist of a column containing the relevant feature vectors. A transformer
    will then take this input DataFrame and predict a label for each feature vector.
    The transformer will then output a new DataFrame with a new column containing
    the predicted labels.'

    an estimator is a type of learning algorithm, such as a logistic regression algorithm.
    In this case, the estimator is called *LogisticRegression* in `MLlib`. The estimator
    will take an input DataFrame and call the `fit()` method on it. The output of
    the `fit()` method, and hence the output of the estimator, will be a *trained
    model*. In this example, the *LogisticRegression* estimator will produce a trained
    *LogisticRegressionModel* model object. The model object itself is, in fact, a
    *transformer*, because the trained model can now take a new DataFrame containing
    new feature vectors and make predictions on them.'

    NLP *transformations* are applied to tokenize raw training text into a set of

    called HashingTF is then applied to take the set of terms and convert it into
    fixed-length feature vectors (HashingTF ultimately calculates the term frequencies
    using a hash function). HashingTF is also a *transformer*. The *LogisticRegression*

    also exposes methods to save trained models and pipelines to an underlying filesystem
    that can then be loaded later on if and when required. `MLlib` also provides utility
    methods covering operations in statistics, linear algebra, and data engineering.
