<p class="mce-root">As the world changes and humans build smarter and better machines, the demand for machine learning and computer vision experts increases. Machine learning, as the name suggests, is the process of a machine learning to make predictions given a certain set of parameters as input. Computer vision, on the other hand, gives a machine vision; that is, it makes the machine aware of visual information. When you combine these technologies, you get a machine that can use visual data to make predictions, which brings machines one step closer to having human capabilities. When you add deep learning to it, the machine can even surpass human capabilities in terms of making predictions. This might seem far-fetched, but with AI systems taking over decision-based systems, this has actually become a reality. You have AI cameras, AI monitors, AI sound systems, AI-powered processors, and more. We cannot promise you that you will be able to build an AI camera after reading this book, but we do intend to provide you with the tools necessary for you to do so. The most powerful tool that we are going to introduce is the OpenCV library, which is the world's largest computer vision library. Even though its use in machine learning is not very common, we have provided some examples and concepts on how it can be used for machine learning. We have gone with a hands-on approach in this book and we recommend that you try out every single piece of code present in this book to build an application that showcases your knowledge. The world is changing and this book is our way of helping young minds change it for the better.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have tried to explain all the concepts from scratch to make the book suitable for beginners as well as advanced readers. We recommend that readers have some basic knowledge of Python programming, but it's not mandatory. Whenever you encounter some Python syntax that you are not able to understand, make sure you look it up on the internet. <em>Help is always provided to those who look for it.</em></p>

<p>We recommend that you go through any good Python programming book or online tutorials or videos, if you are a beginner in Python. You can also have a look at DataCamp (<a href="http://www.datacamp.com" target="_blank">http://www.datacamp.com</a>) to learn Python using interactive lessons.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you learn some basic concepts about the Matplotlib library in Python. You can try out this tutorial for that: <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python">https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need to have anything installed on your system for this book before starting it. We will cover all the installation steps in the first chapter.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "We can set both <kbd>max_samples&lt;1.0</kbd> and <kbd>max_features&lt;1.0</kbd> to implement the random patches method."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>In [1]: from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier... from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier... bag_knn = BaggingClassifier(KNeighborsClassifier(),... n_estimators=10)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
