<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Preprocessing and Exploring Data with Qlik Sense</h1>
<p>Data processing and exploration are essential steps in the data analysis process. They involve transforming raw data into meaningful insights, identifying patterns, and gaining a deeper understanding of the data. Qlik Sense is a powerful data analytics tool that allows users to easily process and explore data. With its data cleansing, transformation, and integration capabilities, Qlik Sense makes it easy to prepare data for analysis and produce a good dataset to be used for machine <span class="No-Break">learning models.</span></p>
<p>This chapter will introduce data preprocessing and exploration with Qlik Sense. We will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a data model using the <span class="No-Break">data manager</span></li>
<li>Creating a data model and altering data with <span class="No-Break">Qlik script</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Validating data</span></li>
<li>Utilizing data lineage and <span class="No-Break">data catalogs</span></li>
<li>Exploring data and finding insights using <span class="No-Break">Insight Advisor</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Creating a data model with the data manager</h1>
<p>A good <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>data model is important because it forms the foundation of effective data analysis. A data model is a representation of the structure and relationships within a dataset, and it defines the rules for how data is stored, accessed, <span class="No-Break">and used.</span></p>
<p>Qlik’s data manager is<a id="_idIndexMarker331"/> a data preparation and management tool that is part of the Qlik Sense platform. It provides a user-friendly interface for designing and building data models, as well as cleaning, transforming, and integrating data from a variety <span class="No-Break">of sources.</span></p>
<p>Qlik’s data manager<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> provides a range of features to support data preparation and management, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Data profiling</strong>: Qlik’s<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> data manager provides tools that help users understand their data, including data profiling features, which allow users to identify data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicates, <span class="No-Break">and outliers.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data transformation</strong>: Qlik’s <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>data manager provides a range of tools for cleaning and transforming data, including the ability to remove duplicates, fill in missing values, and convert data types. It also provides advanced transformation capabilities, such as data pivoting and <span class="No-Break">data normalization.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data integration</strong>: Qlik’s <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>data manager allows users to integrate data from a variety of sources, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, databases, and cloud-based services. It provides built-in connectors to popular data sources and the ability to create custom connectors for other <span class="No-Break">data sources.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data modeling</strong>: Qlik’s data <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>manager allows users <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>to create data models using a graphical interface. It provides tools for defining tables, fields, and relationships between tables, as well as the ability to add calculated fields and build complex <span class="No-Break">data models.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will look into these features of the data manager using an example dataset. We will not cover a full data model creation in detail since that is not in within the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The example dataset used in these examples can be found from the GitHub repository of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Introduction to the data manager</h2>
<p>Let’s start getting<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> familiar with the data manager by taking a look at the user interface. As a preparation step we have created a new analytics application in the Qlik cloud tenant and uploaded our sample dataset (<strong class="source-inline">Sales Multi Table.xlsx</strong>). The data manager view will open. An example of that view can be seen in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer042">
<img alt="Figure 6.1: The data manager view" height="972" src="image/B19863_06_01.jpg" width="1599"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1: The data manager view</p>
<p>In this figure, we have divided the data manager into three different sections, which we will <span class="No-Break">cover next:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Data modeling</strong>: In this <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>space you can create the actual data model. One bubble represents the entity of data, for example, an Excel sheet or database table. When clicking the left mouse button on a bubble, the color of other bubbles will change. This color represents how well these two entities link with <span class="No-Break">each other.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data preview</strong>: If you have<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> activated one data entity or bubble, the data preview shows the snapshot of all the columns and sample data about the entity. The active entity is highlighted with darker borders in the data modeling view. You can enter the data edit view, refresh, and delete data entities from <span class="No-Break">this view.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Associations</strong>: All <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>associations between the entities that are discovered by the data manager can be seen on the right side of the screen. You can preview the associations and approve these using <span class="No-Break">this view.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we will take a look at how to create a <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>data model using our sample dataset. We will start by dragging a data entity called <strong class="bold">Categories</strong> on top of the data entity called <strong class="bold">Products</strong>. When we start dragging the <strong class="bold">Categories</strong> entity, we will see a view similar to <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer043">
<img alt="Figure 6.2: Data manager – linking tables together" height="592" src="image/B19863_06_02.jpg" width="536"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2: Data manager – linking tables together</p>
<p>In this picture, we see that <strong class="bold">Products</strong> entity has a green arc on the outer edge and several other entities have an orange arc. The arc and color represent the match between the two entities. Since the <strong class="bold">Products</strong> entity is the best match, we can drop our<strong class="bold"> Categories</strong> entity on top of <strong class="bold">Products</strong>. We have now linked these two data entities together. The actual linking table is visible at the bottom of the data modeling view. It is highlighted in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer044">
<img alt="Figure 6.3: The data manager – association done" height="915" src="image/B19863_06_03.jpg" width="1631"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.3: The data manager – association done</p>
<p>If you’d like<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> to edit the linking field, that can be done by pressing the button in the middle of the highlighted area. You can now proceed to building the rest of the data model. This can be done either one by one or by selecting <strong class="bold">Apply all</strong> button located at the top section of the <strong class="bold">Associations</strong> view, as seen in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer045">
<img alt="Figure 6.4: The Apply all button" height="371" src="image/B19863_06_04.jpg" width="371"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.4: The Apply all button</p>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span xml:lang="en-GB">You should see</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idIndexMarker344"/></span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> the ready data model. It should look like the one in the following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer046">
<img alt="Figure 6.5: Data model ready" height="588" src="image/B19863_06_05.jpg" width="607"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.5: Data model ready</p>
<p>Next, we<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> will take a closer look into editing capabilities in the data manager. We will start by selecting the <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> entity. We should see the content of <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Data </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">preview </strong></span><span class="No-Break">section.</span></p>
<p>To modify the entity, we will select the small pen icon located at the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Data preview</strong> section. The <strong class="bold">Data edit</strong> view will open and should look like the one in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer047">
<img alt="Figure 6.6: The Data edit view" height="824" src="image/B19863_06_06.jpg" width="1620"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.6: The Data edit view</p>
<p>The Data edit view is divided into the <span class="No-Break">following sections:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Data preview</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> is a preview of the data entity that has been opened for editing. You can also see the data types that are auto-detected on top of each column. For example, datetime fields and fields containing geo-based data are marked and handled accordingly. An auto-calendar is created for <strong class="source-inline">datetime</strong> fields, and coordinates are assigned <span class="No-Break">to geodata.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data summary</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> data summary will show statistics and the distribution of the data. This section is good for validation and outlier detection. This section will also tell you how many total values and unique values there are in an <span class="No-Break">specific column.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data editing</strong>: The data <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>editing section will allow you to perform several operations on the data field using graphical tools. These operations contain null value replacements, replacing certain values with others, creating buckets and splitting data. For example, null value replacement is an important<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> preprocessing step for <span class="No-Break">machine learning.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we will take a closer look into some of the sections using the <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> entity as an example. Let’s select the <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> column and change its type to <strong class="bold">Measure</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section. You should see something like the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer048">
<img alt="Figure 6.7: The Salary field active in the Data edit view" height="841" src="image/B19863_06_07.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.7: The Salary field active in the Data edit view</p>
<p>We can see that the <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>data preview section shows us the minimum, median, average, and maximum values and the distribution of each individual value. The data editing section will give us options to create for example data buckets, replace certain values, and set values to <span class="No-Break">null fields.</span></p>
<p>Let’s next activate the <strong class="bold">EmployeeName</strong> field. We will see the following view, which will differ slightly from the one we saw for the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Salary</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> field:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer049">
<img alt="Figure 6.8: The EmployeeName field active in the Data edit view" height="838" src="image/B19863_06_08.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8: The EmployeeName field active in the Data edit view</p>
<p>Now we can see a different <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>view in the data summary section that shows the unique values and total values. We will also see new options in our data edit section. There is an option to split the field, for example, into first name and last name, and you can also set the order. We don’t see an option for buckets with this field since <strong class="bold">EmployeeName</strong> is a <span class="No-Break">text field.</span></p>
<p>In the upper right corner, we can see the <strong class="bold">Add field</strong> button and under that, we can add a calculated field. If we select that, a wizard guiding us on field creation will appear. Let’s create a calculated field for our <strong class="bold">Employee</strong> entity. A wizard, as shown in the following figure, should <span class="No-Break">be visible:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer050">
<img alt="Figure 6.9: Add calculated field" height="466" src="image/B19863_06_09.jpg" width="297"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.9: Add calculated field</p>
<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> case, we would like to calculate our employee’s monthly salary within two decimals. We will name our field <strong class="source-inline">MontlySalary</strong> and give the following expression in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Expression</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> field:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
Round((Salary/12),0.01)</pre> <p>The <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> section will show the sample values while we are typing our calculation. You can access fields, functions, and operators using the buttons under the <strong class="bold">Expression</strong> section. When ready, press <strong class="bold">Create</strong> to add the calculated field to our <span class="No-Break">data entity.</span></p>
<p>When you look into the header section of each field, you can see the icons highlighted in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer051">
<img alt="Figure 6.10: Headers in the Data edit view" height="350" src="image/B19863_06_10.jpg" width="1047"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.10: Headers in the Data edit view</p>
<p>The icon <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>on the left side will give you the option to change the data type of each field. The data manager should automatically recognize most of the data fields. For example, in the previous image, the <strong class="bold">Hire Date</strong> field is recognized as a <strong class="source-inline">Date</strong> type and there is a small calendar icon, while other fields are of the generic type. Available field types are <strong class="bold">General</strong>, <strong class="bold">Date</strong>, <strong class="bold">Timestamp</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Geodata</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Fields that have associations are marked with a chain icon, as seen in the previous figure, on top of the <strong class="source-inline">Employees.EmployeeID</strong> field and the <strong class="source-inline">Employees.Office</strong> field. You can edit or break the association by selecting the <span class="No-Break">chain icon.</span></p>
<p>The right-most icon will give you options to modify the field. Under that, you can find options to rename the field, associate the field with other tables, edit sorting, hide the field from analysis, and <span class="No-Break">view details.</span></p>
<p>We have now gone briefly through most of the features in the data manager. The next step is to load data into Qlik’s engine. To do that, we can select the <strong class="bold">Load data</strong> button located in the top-right corner. Data loading will start and after that, we can move on to the <span class="No-Break">visualization part.</span></p>
<p>In the next section, we will take a brief look into Qlik script. We will discover some of the most important functions that we can utilize in our machine learning and data <span class="No-Break">visualization solutions.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The data manager generates Qlik script in the background. A good way to start investigating scripting is to create a data model using the data manager and switch to the data load editor to see the <span class="No-Break">generated script.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">A data model can be viewed using the data model viewer. The data model viewer will represent the relationships between tables and give a sample of the data that each table contains. We will not cover the usage in depth in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Introduction to Qlik script</h1>
<p>Qlik script is <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>a scripting language used in Qlik Sense and QlikView for loading and transforming data from various sources into Qlik’s associative data model. It is a powerful and flexible scripting language that allows users to extract, transform, and load data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and flat files, and then prepare that data <span class="No-Break">for analysis.</span></p>
<p>Qlik script is like SQL in terms of syntax and structure, but it includes additional features and functions that make it more powerful and flexible. With Qlik script, users can perform complex data transformations, create calculated fields, generate variables, and apply filters to data. The script can be used to define data models, specify data sources, and load data from them, and define data transformations. The data manager that we used in the previous section generates Qlik script in the background, and all operations done using the data manager can be done <span class="No-Break">using scripting.</span></p>
<p>When using<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> Qlik script, the following procedures are typically involved in creating a data model for <span class="No-Break">an application:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Connect to a data source</strong>: First, we need to establish a connection to a data source. This could be a database, Excel file, CSV file, or any other supported data format. Creating data connections is not covered in detail in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Start the script</strong>: We will begin by writing a script statement to initiate the script. In Qlik, a script typically starts with the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">LOAD</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> keyword.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Load data from the data source</strong>: Use the <strong class="source-inline">LOAD</strong> statement to fetch data from your data source into Qlik. Specify the fields you want to load and the source table or file. In this example, we will load the <strong class="source-inline">Employees</strong> table and <strong class="source-inline">Office</strong> table from <strong class="source-inline">Sales Multi Table.xlsx</strong>. These tables will link through the <strong class="source-inline">[Office]</strong> field <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>since, in Qlik script, fields with similar names will form a link. You can modify the name using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">as</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> keyword.</span><pre class="source-code">

This may include renaming fields, changing data types, filtering rows, or joining tables. Qlik provides various functions and operators to manipulate data. We will take a closer look into some of the functions in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Create </strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker357"/></strong><strong class="bold">table associations</strong>: Qlik’s associative data model allows you to establish relationships between tables based on common fields. You can also create joins between tables and concatenate data <span class="No-Break">if needed.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Save and reload the script</strong>: After completing the script, save it and click the reload button. This will load the data into the Qlik application and create the <span class="No-Break">data model.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Important functions in Qlik script</h2>
<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>will take a closer look into some of the functions in Qlik script that are helpful when creating a machine learning-ready <span class="No-Break">data model:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Date functions</strong>: Qlik <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>provides a variety of date functions, such as <strong class="source-inline">Date()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Year()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Month()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Day()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Quarter()</strong>, to extract and manipulate date-related information <span class="No-Break">from fields.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">String functions</strong>: Qlik <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>offers numerous string functions, such as <strong class="source-inline">Len()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Upper()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Lower()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Concatenate()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Left()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Right()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Mid()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">SubField()</strong>, for string manipulation <span class="No-Break">and formatting.</span><p class="list-inset">This is an example using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Upper()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> function:</span></p><pre class="source-code">
LOAD
    CustomerID,

<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">A full Qlik script reference guide with examples is available at the Qlik <span class="No-Break">help site.</span></p>
<p>Now we have taken a brief overview of some of the most important functions in Qlik script. Qlik scripting is a powerful tool for manipulating data and creating data models. Next, we will take a closer look into data validation using multiple tools in <span class="No-Break">Qlik Cloud.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Validating data</h1>
<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>multiple options to validate and investigate our data with Qlik Cloud before moving to the data editing and analysis phase. Let’s start by using a data catalog. We will take a closer look into data catalogs in the next section of this chapter, but in this section, we will cover some of the features for data validation. First, we will open <strong class="source-inline">Sales Multi table.xlsx</strong> and move to the <strong class="bold">Fields</strong> section in our data catalog. Let’s also select the <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> tab. We should see the <span class="No-Break">following view:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer052">
<img alt="Figure 6.11: Data catalog" height="729" src="image/B19863_06_11.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11: Data catalog</p>
<p>Here we<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> can see a data distribution of all fields in the <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> entity. By default, we have <strong class="bold">Tile view </strong>open in our catalog. The following figure represents the tile of our <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> field. Let’s take a closer look into <span class="No-Break">that next:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer053">
<img alt="Figure 6.12: The Salary field in the data catalog" height="261" src="image/B19863_06_12.jpg" width="309"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.12: The Salary field in the data catalog</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> tile will show us the minimum, average and maximum value of the <strong class="bold">Salary </strong>field. It will <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>also tell us the number of distinct values. Using this information, we can already identify the possible outliers and get a preliminary understanding of the <span class="No-Break">data distribution.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will change from <strong class="bold">tile view</strong> to <strong class="bold">list view</strong> using the small icon in the top-right corner (highlighted in the following figure). The following view should <span class="No-Break">be visible:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer054">
<img alt="Figure 6.13: Data catalog – list view" height="697" src="image/B19863_06_13.jpg" width="1287"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.13: Data catalog – list view</p>
<p>This view will tell us the data type of each field and the number of distinct and null values, and give a sample of values in each field. Data type and number of null values are especially valuable when starting to create a machine <span class="No-Break">learning solution.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will continue our data validation using the data manager. We already covered some parts of the data manager in the previous section. We are using our <strong class="source-inline">Sales Multi Table.xlsx</strong> that was imported into the data manager, and we have opened our <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> entity for editing. Refer to the section covering the data manager earlier in this chapter <span class="No-Break">if needed.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will activate the<strong class="bold"> EmployeeName</strong> field. The data summary section should look like <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer055">
<img alt="Figure 6.14: The EmployeeName field summary" height="337" src="image/B19863_06_14.jpg" width="588"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.14: The EmployeeName field summary</p>
<p>Here we<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> can see that this field is handled as a dimension, and we have 47 values in total. All the values are unique, and we can see the distribution. Next, we can activate the <strong class="bold">Hire Date</strong> field. The following summary <span class="No-Break">is visible:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer056">
<img alt="Figure 6.15: The Hire Date field summary" height="407" src="image/B19863_06_15.jpg" width="597"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.15: The Hire Date field summary</p>
<p>Here we <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>can see the distribution of data and the number of total and distinct values. We can also see the value range for the data. This information is helpful when investigating the data and looking for potential outliers. Next, we can select the <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> field and we should see the following (you might need to change the type from dimension <span class="No-Break">to measure):</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer057">
<img alt="Figure 6.16: The Salary field summary" height="406" src="image/B19863_06_16.jpg" width="595"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.16: The Salary field summary</p>
<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker391"/> <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> field summary will tell us the distribution, the number of total and distinct values, and the minimum, median, average, and maximum values. This information will help us further with our data investigation <span class="No-Break">and validation.</span></p>
<p>The third option to validate data is to utilize Qlik’s analytic objects and create a view on top of the data model. We will cover this in the later chapters of this book. Also, later in this chapter, we will look at Insight Advisor and how to use that to analyze data. Insight Advisor is a powerful tool for <span class="No-Break">data validation.</span></p>
<p>Now that we have an overview of the data validation, we will investigate the possibilities of data lineage and data catalogs. These tools will help us to understand the data better and also help us to visualize the <span class="No-Break">data pipelines.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Data lineage and data catalogs</h1>
<p>In Qlik Sense, data lineage and data catalogs are two important features that help users to better understand, manage, and govern <span class="No-Break">their data.</span></p>
<p><strong class="bold">Data lineage</strong> refers <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>to the path that data takes from its source to its destination, including all the transformations that occur along the way. In Qlik Sense, data lineage provides a visual representation of how data is transformed as it moves through the system. This helps users to understand the origin and quality of the data, as well as identify any issues or bottlenecks in the data flow. With data lineage, users can trace data back to its original source, identify any data dependencies, and ensure that the data is accurate <span class="No-Break">and reliable.</span></p>
<p><strong class="bold">A data catalog</strong> refers<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> to a centralized repository of metadata that describes the data assets in an organization. In Qlik Sense, a data catalog provides a way to discover, understand, and collaborate on data assets. With a data catalog, users can search for data assets, view metadata and lineage information, and collaborate with others on the data. The data catalog also helps to ensure that data is properly governed, by providing a single source of truth for data definitions, data quality rules, and other <span class="No-Break">important metadata.</span></p>
<p>Together, data lineage and data catalogs provide a comprehensive view of an organization’s data assets, from its origin to its usage, enabling users to better understand and govern their data, and make informed decisions based on <span class="No-Break">reliable information.</span></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look into both <span class="No-Break">features next.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Data lineage</h2>
<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> data lineage feature can be found under the application options (the three dots on the right side of the application tile) in Qlik Cloud tenant. The following figure shows the <strong class="bold">Lineage</strong> <span class="No-Break">option highlighted:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer058">
<img alt="Figure 6.17: Qlik’s Lineage function under application options" height="465" src="image/B19863_06_17.jpg" width="928"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.17: Qlik’s Lineage function under application options</p>
<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>selecting <strong class="bold">Lineage</strong>, a new view visualizing the whole lineage path for the selected application will open. An example of that view is visible in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer059">
<img alt="Figure 6.18: Data lineage view" height="411" src="image/B19863_06_18.jpg" width="1538"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.18: Data lineage view</p>
<p>The lineage view will show us how the data flows from the source systems into our end-user application. In this case our source system is an Azure SQL server, and we have a Qlik application called <strong class="bold">QVD Generator</strong> that will produce QVD files and store them in Qlik Cloud. These QVD files and files from other folders in our cloud environment are then used as base data for our end-user application, called <strong class="bold">Wide World Importers</strong>. It is also possible to view lineage at the table level. The following figure represents the lineage view for the <strong class="bold">Countries</strong> table found in our <span class="No-Break">end-user application:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer060">
<img alt="Figure 6.19: Data lineage for a single table in an end-user application" height="375" src="image/B19863_06_19.jpg" width="1599"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.19: Data lineage for a single table in an end-user application</p>
<p>From this <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>view we can easily verify what data is combined into the <strong class="bold">Countries</strong> table and where that data <span class="No-Break">originated from.</span></p>
<p>Data lineage is a powerful tool for investigating the source and transformations of the data, and it is useful when working with data. It has a lot of features, and we only covered the most basic use case here. If you are interested in finding out more, there are a lot of materials available in Qlik Cloud’s <span class="No-Break">help pages.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will take a closer look at data catalogs and how to investigate individual data objects in <span class="No-Break">more detail.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Data catalogs</h2>
<p>We<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> already discovered some of the data validation features of data catalogs in this chapter. Let’s take a closer look at some of the other aspects of data catalogs next. We will start by opening the <strong class="source-inline">Sales Multi Table.xlsx</strong> file in Qlik Cloud. Once you have uploaded the file into the cloud, you should see the <span class="No-Break">following tile:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer061">
<img alt="Figure 6.20: The Sales Multi Table.xlsx dataset tile" height="247" src="image/B19863_06_20.jpg" width="291"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.20: The Sales Multi Table.xlsx dataset tile</p>
<p>Select <strong class="bold">Open dataset</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>you will end up in the data catalog. Your view should look like <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer062">
<img alt="Figure 6.21: The data catalog’s front page" height="831" src="image/B19863_06_21.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.21: The data catalog’s front page</p>
<p>The data catalog contains the <span class="No-Break">following sections:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Metadata</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>general metadata about the file. This section will tell when the data is uploaded, where it is used, and who owns it. It will also give insights into the popularity of the dataset and the structure of <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Classifications</strong>: If any of the field is classified to personal information, sensitive <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>or any other tag, this information can be seen here. If data is classified, we should be extremely careful when utilizing it. We can also set classifications on the dataset level using <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Fields</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>section will give us an overview of the fields and the data in each field. This was already covered in more detail in the data validation section of <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we can take a closer look at classifications. Let’s move to the <strong class="bold">Fields</strong> tab and select the <strong class="bold">Employees</strong> entity. Under that we can select the <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> field. We should see <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer063">
<img alt="Figure 6.22: Data classification in the catalog" height="516" src="image/B19863_06_22.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.22: Data classification in the catalog</p>
<p>In the data classification view, we can give aliases to each field and provide them with a description. We can also tag individual fields and tell whether they contain personal or sensitive information. Augmenting information with tags and descriptions is important since many people in your organization might not be familiar with the data. Providing this information can also help us when creating a machine learning solution since we can get a better understanding of the data if additional information <span class="No-Break">is provided.</span></p>
<p>The data catalog<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> will help us to get familiar with the data and build a good collection of datasets. Next, we will take a closer look into Insight Advisor and how it can help us to get familiar with data and create <span class="No-Break">visualizations easily.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Exploring data and finding insights</h1>
<p>Qlik Insight Advisor<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> is a feature in Qlik Sense that uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to help users explore data and discover insights. By <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>using Qlik Insight Advisor, you can leverage the power of natural language processing and AI to explore your data, ask questions, and discover <span class="No-Break">meaningful insights.</span></p>
<p>In <a href="B19863_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we already learned some of the basics of Insight Advisor. It is also possible to explore data and find insights<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> using Qlik objects and visualizations without the augmented intelligence features. We will take a closer look at how to create visualizations this way in a later section of this book. In this section, we will discover how Insight Advisor will help us to get meaningful insights out of <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
<p>We will begin by using the <strong class="source-inline">Sales Multi Table.xlsx</strong> file as our source data. We already created a data model on top of that dataset earlier in this chapter and loaded the data into an associative engine. After the data load is ready, we can select <strong class="bold">Go to Sheet</strong> and see the following <span class="No-Break">three options:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer064">
<img alt="Figure 6.23: Options to discover data in the new application" height="444" src="image/B19863_06_23.jpg" width="787"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.23: Options to discover data in the new application</p>
<p>In this case, we<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> will select <strong class="bold">Explore the data</strong>. This will launch Insight Advisor and the following view <span class="No-Break">should appear:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer065">
<img alt="Figure 6.24: Insight Advisor" height="840" src="image/B19863_06_24.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.24: Insight Advisor</p>
<p>In this figure, we can see four <span class="No-Break">different sections:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Data exploration</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>segment contains all the fields in our source data and all the master items (if we have created these) in <span class="No-Break">our applicatio.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Natural language input</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> input field allows us to ask natural language questions from <span class="No-Break">Insight Advisor</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Options</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> section will guide us to use different analysis types supported by <span class="No-Break">Insight Advisor</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Analysis types</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>section will give us shortcuts to different <span class="No-Break">analysis types</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start our data explorations by picking a field from a list in section one. We can select for example, the field called <strong class="bold">Country</strong>. The following view will appear giving us information about the data in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Country</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> field:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer066">
<img alt="Figure 6.25: Insight Advisor – field information" height="977" src="image/B19863_06_25.jpg" width="1427"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.25: Insight Advisor – field information</p>
<p>This view will <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>show us the number of different countries as a KPI, a table showing all the countries by name, and a map showing the actual areas. We can return to the previous view by <span class="No-Break">selecting </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Cancel</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will investigate guided analysis types. Let’s start by selecting <strong class="bold">Ranking</strong> from the analysis type section. We should see <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer067">
<img alt="Figure 6.26: Insight Advisor – ranking" height="501" src="image/B19863_06_26.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.26: Insight Advisor – ranking</p>
<p>In this view, we can select the measure and dimension to be used in our ranking graphs. Let’s select <strong class="bold">Sales</strong> as a measure and <strong class="bold">SalesOffice</strong> as a dimension. This will give us our sales offices ranked by sales. We can see that Insight Advisor is using sum as an aggregator for the <strong class="bold">Sales</strong> field. This is correct in this case, but it can be modified if needed. Now we should see the <span class="No-Break">following view:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer068">
<img alt="Figure 6.27: Insight Advisor – ranking results" height="810" src="image/B19863_06_27.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.27: Insight Advisor – ranking results</p>
<p>We can see <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>that Insight Advisor generated a bar chart representing the total sales of each sales office for us. It also provided us with some additional information about the total sales and the best-performing sales offices. There are also alternative representations of the same <span class="No-Break">data available.</span></p>
<p>We can add the bar chart to our sheet for further analysis, but it already tells us some important facts about the data. Next, we will investigate one of the more complex analyses. We can return to the previous view by selecting <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> and select <strong class="bold">Create an analysis</strong>. The following screen showing all the available analysis types <span class="No-Break">should appear:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer069">
<img alt="Figure 6.28: Insight Advisor – analysis types" height="841" src="image/B19863_06_28.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.28: Insight Advisor – analysis types</p>
<p>From this list of<a id="_idIndexMarker413"/> analysis types, we will next investigate clustering. Select <strong class="bold">Clustering (k-means)</strong> from the list. Next, select the sum of <strong class="bold">Sales</strong> and the average of <strong class="bold">Discount</strong> as a measure and <strong class="bold">ProductName</strong> as a dimension. The following screen <span class="No-Break">will appear:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer070">
<img alt="Figure 6.29: Insight Advisor – clustering" height="741" src="image/B19863_06_29.jpg" width="1349"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.29: Insight Advisor – clustering</p>
<p>As we can see, there are five different groups of products recognized based on their total sales and <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>average discounts. This will help us investigate our product sales more. We will also get additional information from Insight Advisor about the clusters. There are a lot of different analysis types supported and many are beneficial when exploring data for machine learning solutions. It is highly encouraged that you look at what all the analysis types do and what kind of results you <span class="No-Break">can get.</span></p>
<p>Next, we will look at how the natural language input will work with Insight Advisor. We can first return to our base view by selecting <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>. Now we can start typing an input into the field on top of the screen. Type the <span class="No-Break">following query:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
Give me total sales by CategoryName in each country</pre> <p>As we type our query, we<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> can see that Insight Advisor will suggest different fields. The query will return the <span class="No-Break">following view:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer071">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.30: Insight Advisor – natural language query results</p>
<p>As we can see, Insight Advisor produced various graphs. We got a treemap representing the sales of each product category by country and map, a Pareto chart and a bar chart as alternati<a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>ve results. We also got some insights in <span class="No-Break">written form.</span></p>
<p>Insight Advisor is a <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>powerful tool to discover data and create visualizations. In this section, we touched on the basics of it. A lot more information can be found in Qlik’s help pages. A good way to learn to use them is by playing around with some <span class="No-Break">simple datasets.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we first got some hands-on experience with Qlik’s data manager and learned how to create data models using it. We also learned how to create calculated fields and investigate data. Creating a good data model and modifying data to be suitable for machine learning is the key <span class="No-Break">to success.</span></p>
<p>We also discovered some of the basics of Qlik scripting and how that can be used to perform data transformations. We discovered some of the important functions and features of Qlik script. Scripting is an alternative way to create a data model and manipulate data. It is a powerful tool and can be also combined with modeling created in the <span class="No-Break">data manager.</span></p>
<p>In a later part of the chapter, we learned some methods of validating and investigating the data. We familiarized ourselves with the data catalog and data lineage views and learned to utilize them in data validation. Data validation is a key step in any machine learning or data analytics project, and it is important to understand the data before creating solutions on top <span class="No-Break">of it.</span></p>
<p>The last part of this chapter taught us how to use Insight Advisor for data discovery. Insight Advisor is a powerful tool for conducting analysis using augmented intelligence and mastering it will help us get familiar with <span class="No-Break">data faster.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will continue our hands-on journey and learn how to deploy and monitor machine learning models in both on-premises and cloud environments. This will create a good background for the last chapters of this book, where we will implement some more <span class="No-Break">advanced models.</span></p>
