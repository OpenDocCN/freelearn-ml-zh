- en: Finding something meaningful in increasingly larger and more complex datasets
    is a growing demand of the modern world. Machine learning and predictive analytics
    have become the most important approaches to uncover data gold mines. Machine
    learning uses complex algorithms to make improved predictions of outcomes based
    on historical patterns and the behavior of datasets. Machine learning can deliver
    dynamic insights into trends, patterns, and relationships within data, which is
    immensely valuable to the growth and development of business.

    but you will also dive deep into the complexities of the real-world data before
    moving onto using Hadoop and its wider ecosystem of tools to process and manage
    your structured and unstructured data.

    and Ecosystem"), *An Introduction to Hadoop''s Architecture and Ecosystem*, will
    cover all about Hadoop, starting from its core frameworks to its ecosystem components.
    At the end of this chapter, readers will be able to set up Hadoop and run some
    MapReduce functions; they will be able to use one or more ecosystem components.
    They will also be able to run and manage Hadoop environment and understand the
    command-line usage.'
