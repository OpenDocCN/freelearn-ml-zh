    editions of the **ICPC**, the “**International Collegiate Programming Contest**”.
    In the original ICPC, small teams from universities and companies participated
    in a competition that required solving a series of problems using a computer program
    (at the beginning participants coded in FORTRAN). In order to achieve a good final
    rank, teams had to display good skills in team working, problem solving and programming.

    to have a spotlight for recruiting companies provided the students enough motivation
    and it made the competition popular for many years. Among ICPC finalists, a few
    ones have become renowned. Among these, there is Adam D''Angelo, the former CTO
    of Facebook and founder of Quora, Nikolai Durov, the co-founder of Telegram Messenger,
    and Matei Zaharia, the creator of Apache Spark. Together with many others professionals,
    they all share the same experience: having taken part to an ICPC edition.'

    remote participation become more feasible, allowing international competitions
    more easily and at a lower cost. The format is similar and simply the same for
    most of these competitions: there is a series of problems and you have to code
    a solution to solve them. The winners can then take a prize, but also make themselves
    noticed by recruiting companies or simply become famous and popular among their
    peers.'

    theory, graph theory, algorithmic game theory, computational geometry, string
    analysis, and data structures. Recently also problems relative to artificial intelligence
    have successfully emerged, in particular after the launch of the KDD Cup, a contest
    in knowledge discovery and data mining, held by the **Association for Computing**
    **Machinery's** (**ACM**) **Special Interest Group** (**SIG**) on Knowledge Discovery
    and Data Mining, during its annual conference.

    data science competition platforms, platforms where companies can host data science
    challenges that are somehow hard to solve and that could benefit from a crowdsourcing
    approach. In fact, given the fact that there is no golden approach for all the
    problems in data science, many problems require a time-consuming approach of the
    kind of try-all-that you-can-try.

    manner algorithms and data transformations in order to find the best possible
    combinations but you lack man and computer power for that. That’s why for instance,
    governments and companies resort to competitions in order to advance in certain
    fields. On the government side, we can quote DARPA and its many competitions on
    self-driving cars, robotic operations, machine translation, speaker identification,
    fingerprint recognition, information retrieval, OCR, automatic target recognition,
    and many others. On the business side, we can quote a company such as Netflix,
    which entrusted a competition in order to improve its algorithm to predict user
    movie selection.
  prefs: []

- en: 'The Netflix competition was based on the idea of improving existing collaborative
    filtering, whose purpose is simply to predict the potential rating of a user for
    film, solely based on the previous ratings that the user gave on other films without
    knowing in specific who the user is or what the films are. Since no user description
    or movie title or description were available (all replaced by identity codes),
    the competition required to develop smart ways to use the available past ratings.
    The grand prize of USD $1,000,000 was to be assigned only if the solution could
    improve the existing Netflix algorithm, Cinematch, above a certain threshold.
    The competition run from 2006 to 2009 and in the end saw a team made up by the
    fusion of many previously teams in competitions (a team from Commendo Research
    & Consulting GmbH, Andreas Töscher and Michael Jahrer, quite renown also in Kaggle
    competitions, two researchers from AT&T Labs and two others from Yahoo!). In the
    end, winning the competition required so much computation power and the ensembling
    of different solutions, that teams were forced to merge in order to keep pace.
    Such situation, reflected also on the actual usage of the solution by Netflix,
    which preferred not to implement it, but to simply take the most interesting insight
    from it in order to improve its existing Cinematch algorithm (you can read more
    about it on this Wired article: [https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/)).
    What mattered more in the end of the Netflix competition has not been the solution
    per se, which has been quickly superseded by the change in business of Netflix
    from DVDs to online movies. The real benefit for both participants (who gained
    a huge reputation in collaborative filtering) and the company (who could transfer
    its improved recommendation knowledge to its new business) were the insights that
    has been gained from participating in the competition (and we can advance that
    knowledge will be also the leitmotiv of most of this book).'

    The list is indeed long but we can quote a few examples where the company holding
    the competition reported a clear benefit from it. For instance, we can quote the
    insurance company AllState that could improve its actuarial models built by their
    experts thanks to a competition involving hundreds of data scientists ([https://www.kaggle.com/c/ClaimPredictionChallenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ClaimPredictionChallenge)).

    that could improve by 40% the industry standard on predicting arrival times of
    airline flights thanks to an analogue competition ([https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight)).

    company, which is the common thread of all this book.

- en: Kaggle took its first steps in February 2010 thanks to the idea of Anthony Goldbloom,
    an Australian trained economist (he has a degree in Economics and Econometrics
    from Melbourne University). After working at Australia's Department of Treasury
    and in the Research department at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Goldbloom worked
    in London as an intern at The Economist, the international weekly newspaper on
    current affairs, international business, politics, and technology. At The Economist
    he had occasion to write an article about big data that inspired his idea of building
    a competition platform that could crowdsource the best analytical experts in solving
    interesting machine learning problems ([https://www.smh.com.au/technology/from-bondi-to-the-big-bucks-the-28yearold-whos-making-data-science-a-sport-20111104-1myq1.html](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/from-bondi-to-the-big-bucks-the-28yearold-whos-making-data-science-a-sport-20111104-1myq1.html)).
    Since the crowdsourcing dynamics had a relevant part in the business idea for
    this platform, he derived the name Kaggle, which recalls by rhyme the term “gaggle”
    i.e. a flock of geese (the goose is also the symbol of the platform).

    $11.25 million in Series A funding from a round led by Khosla Ventures and Index

    the community grew and some of the initial competitors came to become quite prominent,
    such as Jeremy Howards, the Australian data scientist and entrepreneur, who, after
    winning a couple of competitions on Kaggle, become the President and Chief Scientist
    of the company. Jeremy Howard left his position as President in December 2013
    and thereafter he started a new start-up, fast.ai ([www.fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai)),

    decided to retire and to found their own company, DataRobot. They soon after started
    hiring their best employers among the participants in the Kaggle competitions

    tabular data competitions, that is competitions based on problems related to structured
    data that can be found in a database. Now such competitions are really less required
    because a crowdsourced solution would not often be such an advance in respect
    of what a good team of data scientists or even an autoML software could reach.
    First using random forests, then using gradient boosting methods with clever feature
    engineering, in the past tabular data solution derived from Kaggle could really
    largely improve a solution. Nowadays, given the spread of better software and
    good practices, the obtainable increased results from competitions could be indeed
    marginal. In the unstructured data world, instead, a good deep learning solution

    that competitions may have different formats. The usual format is the so-called
    “Simple format” where you provide a solution and it is evaluated as we previously
    described. More sophisticated, the two-stage competition splits the contested
    into two parts and the final dataset is released only after the first part has
    completed and only to the participants of the first phase. The two-stage competition
    format has emerged in order to limit the chance that some competitor may cheat
    and infringe the rules since the evaluation is done on a completely untried test
    set that it is available for a short time. For the same reason, also the Code
    competitions have recently appeared, where all submissions are made from a Kaggle

    David Donoho, professor of statistics at Stanford University ([https://web.stanford.edu/dept/statistics/cgi-bin/donoho/](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/statistics/cgi-bin/donoho/)),
    in his writing “50 Years of Data Science”. The paper has first appeared in the
    Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics and then subsequently posted
    on the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (see [http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf)).
    Professor Donoho does not refer to Kaggle specifically, but to all data science
    competition platforms generically. Quoting computational linguist Mark Liberman,
    he refers to data science competitions and platforms as part of a **Common Task
    Framework** (**CTF**) paradigm that has been silently and steadily progressing
    data science in many fields during the last decades. He states that a CTF can
    work incredibly well at improving the solution of a problem in data science from
    an empirical point of view. He quotes as successful examples the NetFlix competition
    and many DARPA competitions that have reshaped the best in class solutions for
    problems in many fields.

    quality. On the long run, the performance of solutions improves by small gains
    until they reach an asymptote. The process can be speeded up by allowing a certain
    amount of sharing among participants (as it happens on Kaggle by means of discussions
    and sharing Kernel notebooks and extra data by Datasets). It can be noticed that
    the only competitive pressure, in spite of any degree of sharing among participants
    doesn’t stop the improvement in the solution, it just makes it slower.

    that, in the framework of a practical problem whose empirical performance has
    to be improved, always leads to the emergence of new benchmarks, new data and
    modeling solutions, and in general to an improved application of machine learning
    to the problem objected of the competition. A competition can therefore provide
    a new way to solve a prediction problem, new ways of feature engineering, new
    algorithmic or modeling solutions. For instance, deep learning has not simply
    emerged from academic research, but it has first gained a great boost because
    of successful competitions that declared its efficacy (we have already mentioned
    for instance the Merck competition won by Geoffrey Hinton’s team [https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners)).

    powerful analytical tools (such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow or PyTorch), the
    CTF paradigm brings even better results because all competitors are on the same
    line at the start. On the other end, the reliance of a solution to a competition
    on specialized or improved hardware can limit the achievable results because it
    can prevent competitors without access to such resources to properly participate
    and contribute directly to the solution or indirectly by exercising competitive
    pressure on the other participants. Understandably, that the reason why Kaggle
    started also offering cloud services for free to participants to its competitions
    (the Kernels): it can flatten some differences in hardware intense competitions
    (like most deep learning ones are) and increase the overall competitive pressure.'

    (so they reveal something of it) or the ordering of the training and test examples
    or some identifier is evocative of the solution. Such solution leakage, sometimes
    named by the competitors as “golden features” (because getting a hint of such
    nuances in the data problem could turn into gold prizes for the participants)
    invariably leads to a not reusable solution. It also implies a suboptimal result
    for the sponsor (who at least should have learned something about leaking features
    that should affect a solution to his/her problem).

    In such situation, you can snoop the solution by repeated submission trials on
    the leaderboard. Again, in this case the solution is completely unusable in different
    circumstances. A clear example of such happened in the competition “Don’t Overfit
    II” ([https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii)).
    In this competition, the winning participant, Zachary Mayers, submitted every
    individual variable as a single submission, gaining information on the possible
    weight of each variable that allowed him to estimate the correct coefficients
    for his model (you can read Zach’s detailed solution here: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii/discussion/91766](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii/discussion/91766)).
    Generally, time series problems (or other problems where there are systematic
    shifts in the test data) may be seriously affected by probing, since they can
    help competitors to successfully define some kind of ‘post-processing’ (like multiplying
    their predictions by a constant) that is most suitable for scoring high on the
    specific test set.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another form of leaderboard snooping happens when participants tend to rely
    more on the feedback from the public leaderboard than their own tests. Sometimes
    such turns into a complete failure of the competition, with a wild shake-up, that
    is a complete and unpredictable reshuffling of the competitors’ positions on the
    final leaderboard. The winning solutions, in such a case, may (but not always)
    turn out to be not so optimal for the problem or even sometimes just dictated
    by chance. This has led to precise analysis by competitors if the training set
    is much different from the test set they have to guess. Such analysis, called
    “Adversarial testing” can provide insight if to rely on the leaderboard and if
    there are features that are too different from the training and test set to be
    better avoided completely (For an example, you can have a look at this Kernel
    by Bojan Tunguz: [https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ieee](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ieee)).
    Another form of defense against leaderboard overfitting is choosing safe strategies
    to avoid submitting solutions too based on the leaderboard results. For instance,
    since two solutions are allowed to be chosen by each participant for the evaluation
    at the end of the competition, a good strategy is to submit the best one performing
    on the leaderboard and the best performing one based on one’s own cross-validation
    tests.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to avoid problems with leaderboard probing and overfitting, Kaggle
    has recently introduced different innovations based on Code Competitions, where
    the evaluation is split into two distinct stages, that is you have a test set
    for the public leaderboard (the leaderboard you follow during the competition)
    and a completely hold out test set for the final private leaderboard. In this
    way, participants are actually blind to the actual data their solutions will be
    evaluated against and they should be forced to consider more their own tests and
    a more general solution against a solution specific to the test set.

    (sharing ideas and solutions in a closed circle of participants) and other illicit
    moves such as playing by multiple accounts or playing in multiple teams and stealing
    ideas from each in favor of another team. All such actions create an asymmetry
    in information between participants that can be favorable to a few and detrimental
    to the most. Again, the resulting solution may be affected because sharing has
    been imperfect during the competition and fewer teams have been able to exercise
    full competitive pressure. Moreover, if such situations appear evident to participants
    (for instance see [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/discussion/122503](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/discussion/122503)),

    actually led sometimes to some suboptimal situation since upvotes are a less objective
    metric and also depends on popularity). The more medals you get, the higher ranks
    of Kaggle mastery you can enter. The ranks are classified in Novice, Contributor,
    Expert, Master, and Grandmaster. The page [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/)
    progression explains everything about how to get medals and how many and of what
    kind are needed to access the different ranks.

    they do change in time. A few years ago, in fact the scoring system and the ranks
    were quite different. Most probably in the future, the ranks will change again
    in order to keep the higher ones rarer and thus more valuable.

    to data science competitions is still quite debated today by many claiming different
    negative or positive opinions.

    it is just focused on leaderboard dynamics

    just for scraping a little more accuracy (while in reality overfitting the test
    set)

- en: Many perceive Kaggle, as many other data science competition platform, far from
    what data science is in reality. The point they raise are that business problems
    are not given from nowhere and you seldom already have a well-prepared dataset
    to start with since you usually built it along the way based on refining the business
    specifications and understanding of the problem at hand. Moreover, they emphasize
    that production is neither considered, since a winning solution cannot be constrained
    by resource limits or considerations about technical debt (though this is not
    always true for all competitions).

    both the fact that Kaggle is a crowdsourcing experience with a purpose (the CTF
    paradigm) and how Kaggle ranking standings do relate in the data science world
    in comparison with data science education and work experience. One persistent
    myth that ailments criticism is in fact that Kaggle competitions may help getting
    you a job or a better job in data science or that performing in Kaggle competitions
    may put you on another plane in respect of data scientists that do not participate
    at all.

- en: Our stance on such a myth is that it is misleading belief that Kaggle rankings
    do have an automatic value beyond the Kaggle community. For instance, in a job
    search, Kaggle can provide you with some very useful competencies on modeling
    data and problems and effective model testing. It can also expose you to many
    techniques and different data/business problems (even beyond your actual experience
    and comfort zone), but it cannot supplement you with everything you need to successfully
    place yourself as a data scientist in a company.

    candidates in a job search; however, how this will be considered will considerably
    vary from company to company. Anyway, what will learn on Kaggle will invariably
    prove useful throughout all of your career and will provide you a hedge when you’ll
    have to solve complex and unusual problems with data modeling because by participating
    in Kaggle competitions you build up strong competencies in modeling and validating.
    You also network with other data scientists and that can get you a reference for
    a job more easily and provide you with another way to handle difficult problems
    beyond your skills because you will have access to others’ competencies and opinions.

    as a data scientist and that it can do that in different ways. Of course, sometimes
    Kaggle will help you directly being contacted as a job candidate based on your
    competitions’ successes, but more often Kaggle will be helpful by providing you
    with the intellectual and experience skills you need to succeed first as a candidate
    then as a practitioner. In fact, after playing with data and models on Kaggle
    for a while, you’ll have had the chance to see enough different datasets problems
    and ways to deal with them under the pressure of time, that when faced with similar
    problems in real settings you’ll get quite skilled in finding solutions quickly
    and effectively.

    writing this book in the first place and what this book is actually about. In
    fact, you won’t exactly find here a guide just about how to win or score high
    on Kaggle competitions (there are also online resources that can enlighten you
    on that, actually) but you’ll absolutely will find a guide about how to compete
    better on Kaggle and how to get back the maximum from your competition experience.

    being first on a competition won't assure you a highly paid job or glory beyond
    the Kaggle community. However, consistently participating in competitions is instead
    a card to be played smartly to show interest and passion in your data science
    job search and to improve some specific skills that can differentiate you as a
    data scientist and not make you obsolete in front of autoML solutions.
