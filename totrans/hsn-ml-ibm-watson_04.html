<p class="mce-root">This chapter (along with previous two) acts as the backbone for the entire book. It provides a tour of the machine learning paradigm—the features and functionalities available through the IBM Cloud and IBM Watson platforms, with a focus on well-known approaches and algorithms. We'll start the chapter by giving a somewhat practical background to what model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning entail. Next, we will look at how the IBM Cloud platform can help to simplify and fast-track the entire process.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Moreover, this chapter will discuss machine learning algorithms for classification and regression problems, and again approach these topics using the IBM Cloud platform. By the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to not only understand the concepts involved in selecting an appropriate classification technique and estimators, but be able to build and deploy basic machine learning models for the data at hand, using IBM Cloud.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We'll divide this chapter into the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Model selection</li>
<li>Testing the model</li>
<li class="mce-root">Classification</li>
<li class="mce-root">Regression</li>
<li>Testing the predictive capability</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Machine learning has become more and more ordinary, and understanding which machine learning algorithm (or model type) to use, based upon your data and objectives, is important, and if you are relatively new to the process, it can be daunting.<br/>
Fitting a model to training data is one thing, but how do you know that the model (technique) or algorithm you select will generalize well to all your data and create the best prediction? Too much training or overfitting doesn't solve this problem; in fact, in this situation, it is typical for the model to perform poorly with totally new data.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Once again, the IBM Cloud platform provides robust and practical tools to assist you with this process.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The cloud offers a machine learning service (IBM Watson Machine Learning). The service offers the ability to manage your developed machine learning models using a continuous learning system, as well as an easy method for deployment, including online, batch, and streaming modes.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can head over to the following link to know more about IBM Watson Machine Learning: <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/machine-learning">https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/machine-learning</a>.</div>
<p class="mce-root">In addition, the model builder offered in IBM Watson Studio (which includes tutorials and sample datasets to illustrate how to train different types of machine learning models without the need for coding) can get you going quickly by stepping you through the, perhaps tedious, task of model selection (and even evaluation and deployment).</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">Later in this chapter, we will refer to a provided data asset to illustrate the process of bringing the reader to an understanding of the process of  selecting a model type, steps to train the model and evaluating the models performance.</div>

<p class="mce-root">The Model Builder in IBM Watson Studio is a graphical tool that actually guides you, step by step, through building your first machine learning models. The model builder utilizes the following workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root">Upload data to train</li>
<li class="mce-root">Choose a machine learning technique and algorithm</li>
<li class="mce-root">Train and evaluate the model</li>
<li class="mce-root">Test and deploy the model</li>
</ol>
<p>The model builder (currently) focuses on creating three basic types of machine learning model techniques (which is typically more than sufficient for starting out with most machine learning projects). Furthermore, for each kind of model, you can choose from multiple algorithms to implement within the model. These are referred to as model techniques.</p>
<p>Part of the angst of building a machine learning solution is selecting the proper ML algorithm to be used. If unsure, or in the interest of saving time, at least for your first few attempts, you may want to utilize the option of having the model builder automatically select  an algorithm for you, based upon the training data you provide. The model techniques include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary classifier</strong>: Classifies data into two categories</li>
<li><strong>Multiclass classifier</strong>: Classifies data into multiple categories</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Predicts a value from a continuous set of values</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's now step through some initial illustrations of using the model builder:</p>
<ol>
<li>To use the model builder, you need to add the Watson Machine Learning service as an asset to a new or existing project (this is referred to as associating the service with the project). To do this from within your project, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Add to project</span> and then choose the <span><span class="packt_screen">WATSON MACHINE LEARNING</span> </span>service as the asset type, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/08abd59d-8055-437c-847a-1ab9a126c4d6.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="2">
<li class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Once you have added this service to your project, you can then create and add new models to the project simply by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">New Watson Machine Learning model</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Models</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/07192c06-ada4-43b1-bd9b-a129d1e18094.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">New model</span> page (as shown in the following screenshot), you must provide your new model's basic details as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><span class="packt_screen">Name</span>: The name of your new model.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><span class="packt_screen">Description</span>: A description of your model.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><span class="packt_screen">Machine Learning Service</span>: The service that the model will use (there are others, but for now, we'll select the IBM Watson Machine Learning service: <span class="packt_screen">Machine Learning-bg</span>).</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><span class="packt_screen">Select model type</span>: In this first attempt, we want to have <span class="packt_screen">Model builder</span> help us choose the model type and algorithms, so you can select <span class="packt_screen">Automatic</span>.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><span class="packt_screen">Select runtime</span>: Select the runtime environment (just use the <span class="packt_screen">Default Spark Scala 2.11</span> option for now). Runtime environments are the combination of memory, space and CPUs which can effect pricing and cost. You can review the details of various runtimes online (<a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/console/environment-runtimes.html">https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/console/environment-runtimes.html</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Finally, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Create</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1e888075-2a5e-47ca-a7d1-1432cb205b98.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">Scala has gained a lot of popularity and is widely used by large number of companies. Scala and Spark are being used at Facebook, Pinterest, Netflix, Conviva, and TripAdvisor for big data and machine learning applications. The IBM Cloud platform offers Scala as one of its defaults.</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you miss<span> or skip the step of associating a machine learning service, when you click on <span class="packt_screen">Create</span></span><span><span class="packt_screen">,</span> you will see the following message:</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Training data</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">At this point, we need to select some training data for our model. So, from the <span class="packt_screen">Select data asset</span> page, we need to locate our specific data asset (file), click on the selection radio button to the left of it, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2ebb30e2-7dc0-4a7d-a1f0-6aa4ba18a825.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">As a note, the <span class="packt_screen">Select data asset</span> page makes it easy to determine which data asset to use for training the model with features such as <span class="packt_screen">Click to preview data</span>:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/841a8ab8-44ca-42c9-8a21-b8febc878c5b.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">By hovering over any listed asset and then clicking on it(Click to preview date), Watson will retrieve and load the data for you to review.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You cannot alter or refine data here, but you can scroll through it to make sure that this is the data asset that you want to use to train your model. If you are satisfied that you want to use this data in your model, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Use This Data</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4be27ed3-9ae4-429f-b5c7-e246289b27a6.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">At this point, it is time to select one of the three model techniques to use. First, you choose what you want to predict (the column in your data file, known as the label column, for which you want the model to predict its value) and the columns to use to determine the prediction. These are known as the columns of data in the data asset that the model should feature—or the feature columns.</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You can then use the model builder's suggested technique (or in other words algorithm) or select your own:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/50105550-ac6b-4bc2-a956-afd4a60517b0.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">One of the clear advantages of using the model builder is that you can easily try before you buy, so to speak. In other words, if you are not sure as to which modeling technique to select and use, you have the opportunity to use and evaluate each option quickly and with minimal investment. In the preceding example, I elected to use a very simple tryst: I want the model to predict a player's height, given his weight, for a selected year (or NFL season).</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Looking at the model technique options offered, <span class="packt_screen">Multiclass Classification</span> is the process of classifying instances into one of three or more classes; <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Binary Classification</strong></span>; is the classification of instances into one of the two classes, and <span class="packt_screen">Regression</span> would work with a large number of classes.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">In this example, the values for height would most likely have more than two possible values, and hence we might choose <span class="packt_screen">Multiclass Classification</span> or even <span class="packt_screen">Regression</span>. Again, it would be best, since the model builder makes quick work of this, to try both and then evaluate the results.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Moving on, if you indicated a manual approach (or selected the <span class="packt_screen">Manual</span> mode) to build the model, you'll have to click on <span class="packt_screen">Add Estimators</span> (in the upper right of the page) to choose one or more specific estimators. Choosing the right model estimator is often even harder than choosing the technique. Different estimators are a better match for different types of data and for solving different problems.</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">As we'll see later in this chapter, the model builder allows you to select multiple estimators for the same model and train on each of them so that you can then easily compare and contrast each estimator's performance results together on the same page.</div>
<p class="mce-root">With the model builder, based upon the classification technique chosen, you'll have a number of estimators to choose from (as shown in the following screenshot). For example, we chose <span class="packt_screen">Multiclass Classification</span>, so you could pick one of the following estimators:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><span class="packt_screen">Decision Tree Classifier</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span class="packt_screen">Random Forecast Classifier</span> </li>
<li class="mce-root"><span class="packt_screen">Naive Bayes</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Here, we will choose the <span class="packt_screen">Random Forest Classifier</span> estimator and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a816874f-8f32-4538-9c66-e3feec24233a.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">After clicking <span class="packt_screen">Add</span>, and then <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>, the model will be trained on the data, technique, and estimator selected. The results will then be posted to the <span class="packt_screen">Select model</span> page (as shown in the following screenshot), where you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> to save the model results for evaluation:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ed8d6853-088c-480e-bddc-1c6404e18cab.png"/></div>
<p><span>A Watson Machine Learning model (created with the Model Builder) becomes an asset and is listed as such (shown above) on the IBM Watson Studio project page for later reference, refinement and reuse.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">It is worth mentioning that an approach to learning how to select a classification technique (algorithm) and estimator is through experimentation with the model builder. In other words, using the broader terms of classification and feature selection, the model builder now makes it effective and efficient enough to test hypotheses with a variety of approaches, easily assess the results, and then deploy the best fit (more on evaluating model performance and accuracy in a later section of this chapter and throughout this book)  as a continuous learning model with new and unseen data.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We will see more on this process with some experimentation later in this chapter.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Deployment of a predictive model so that it can be leveraged in routine decision-making is typically a somewhat complex process due to a variety of challenges, and let's face it—predictive models that never get deployed never add value.</p>
<p class="mce-root">When you create a model by using the IBM Watson Studio model builder, you can deploy the model directly from the model builder after you train it. Even better, after you deploy your model, you can set up a continuous learning and evaluation process for your model.</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">When you deploy a model, you save it to the model repository that is associated with your Watson Machine Learning service, where you can then use your deployed model to score data and build an application.</div>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Now is a good time to have a look at how you can test the model prediction right here in IBM Watson Studio. To do this, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Test</span>:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a68989e6-c88b-478c-b3ec-009a9da63f7e.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The default test format generated shows you an input form that you can use to enter data values. Later, you'll see that if you have an external process generating test data, you can use the input format icons to use JSON data file format and paste in your data test values:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1abb0f86-9580-47a3-be10-13438f495d63.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">For now (staying on the <span class="packt_screen">Test</span> tab), leave the default format (input form) and enter some values for the important columns (the input data form is populated with a sample record from the dataset). To test the model, change the values and click on <span class="packt_screen">Predict</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">For <span class="packt_screen">year</span>, enter <kbd>2016</kbd></li>
<li class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">For <span class="packt_screen">position</span>, enter <kbd>QB</kbd></li>
<li class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">For <span class="packt_screen">weight</span>, enter <kbd>225</kbd></li>
<li class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Click on <span class="packt_screen">Predict</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Once your model test is complete, IBM Watson Studio displays a graphical score (with percentages) of the column's ability to predict the result. In the following example, fields <span class="packt_screen">5</span> and <span class="packt_screen">6</span> are <strong>position</strong> and <strong>weight</strong>, respectively, and we can see by the model's performance scores, their ability to predict the result:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/187f7fd6-bb33-42e0-b376-0143de39bb03.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">So, given the preceding output, we can perhaps conclude that in our NFL player statistical file, a player's position is a pretty good indicator as to what the player's height is.</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If you are so inclined, you can click the output formatting icon (shown circled in the following screenshot) and convert the performance information to raw output (<span class="packt_screen">View raw output</span>):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/42988bd6-b80a-43ac-8cdd-d82e192290f6.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">When you deploy your model in this way (using Watson Studio deploy), the deployment is a one-time event. In other words, you enter your data, train the model on the data, then see the performance results and draw your conclusions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This works for exploration and investigation purposes, but realistically, you'd want to retain and continually train the model with new data as it becomes available. To do this, you can use the IBM Watson Machine Learning continuous learning system, which provides automated monitoring of model performance (discussed briefly in the next section of this chapter), retraining, and redeployment to ensure prediction quality from your model.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Although we won't take the time to go deeply into this topic here in this chapter, IBM Watson Studio does provide a straightforward method to accomplish this, using a model you developed and deployed using the model builder. This method does require choosing a <span class="packt_screen">Spark Service or Environment</span> option and establishing a feedback data store as a project resource, which is where the resulting model performance metrics will be retained (saved).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">These resources can be configured using the <span class="packt_screen">Configure performance monitoring</span> page shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cfe7c773-887b-4ca9-8fa7-630e4b05ed16.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">Once you establish a (feedback) data store, you can use Watson Studio and the model builder to easily define metrics and triggers as part of a continuous learning process and periodically review the updated model performance metrics and use chart controls to switch metrics or to view the results as a chart or as a table.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Classification is a key concept in both machine learning and statistics. We've shown that the model builder offers both binary and multiclass classification techniques (as well as regression). Earlier in this chapter, we used the model builder and arbitrarily selected a classification technique just to show how easy it is to build, train, and deploy a model using the tool. In this section, we will take a closer look at each technique and which choice would make the most sense, given our training data.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Binary (also referred to as <strong>binomial</strong>) classification is the process of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule. The product documentation offers a great example exercise that you can use to understand when binary classification is perhaps the best choice for your model. The example is training a model to predict whether or not a customer is likely to buy a tent from an outdoor equipment store, given the training data sample. If you go ahead and download the sample data and then examine the columns, you can understand how binary classification works. Let's analyze the exercise.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We want to build a model that will predict whether a given customer is likely to purchase a particular product; in this case, a tent. Suppose we again use the model builder to create a new model, load the sample data provided, and set the basic model details.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root">Define a label column. In this example, the choice is <kbd>IS_TENT</kbd>. This column indicates whether or not the customer bought a tent.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Define the feature columns. Feature columns are columns in the data that contain the traits on which the machine learning model will base its predictions. In this historical data, there are the following four feature columns:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>GENDER</kbd>: Customer gender</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>AGE</kbd>: Customer age</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>MARITAL_STATUS</kbd>: <kbd>Married</kbd>, <kbd>Single</kbd>, or <kbd>Unspecified</kbd></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><kbd>PROFESSION</kbd>: General category of the customer's profession, such as <span class="packt_screen">Hospitality</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Sales</span>, or simply <span class="packt_screen">Other</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="3">
<li class="mce-root">Set the build type to <span class="packt_screen">Automatic</span> (this will cause model builder to automatically select an algorithm to implement the machine learning technique you specify).</li>
<li class="mce-root">Click on <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> and add the training data.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root">To train the model, you will specify the preceding label and feature columns and then pick the machine learning technique: binary classification. After the model is saved, the model details page will open automatically. To see which algorithm the model builder used, you can go to the <span class="packt_screen">Summary</span> table in the <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span> information on the model details page (shown in the following screenshot) and click on <span class="packt_screen">View</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Model builder details</span> row:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/aaaa58fb-6862-4df9-9507-89383ddee0c5.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">This will reveal the following details for review:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/96d3dd44-a95e-42ed-acde-fd5dfc69afde.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root">You can see that the model builder, after we picked binary classification, chose <span class="packt_screen">LogisticRegression</span> as its best choice for an estimator. Logistic regression is the usual choice when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). In our case, the dependent variable is our label column, <kbd>IS_TENT</kbd>.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The conclusion, considering our data and objective, is that binary classification was picked as the technique because we want to classify the data into defined categories (think about how the records in the training data could be grouped, for example: males, married, who work in sales; males, single, who work as a professional; and so on). The estimator used (logistic regression) was chosen since, again, the dependent variable is binary (will purchase or will not purchase).</p>
<p class="mce-root">Aligning the sample data values with the chosen technique and estimator, the reasoning behind these choices should begin to make sense. It is a good idea to continue to experiment with data and the model builder to gain further comfort with these concepts.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Multiclass (also referred to as <strong>multinomial</strong>) classification is the duty of classifying elements of a prearranged set into one of three or more groups. Again, the product documentation provides a good example of this: training a model to predict which product category is most likely to interest a customer in an outdoor equipment store.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the previous section, the example used the same data, but this example use case is looking to determine a product category (group) as the result, rather than a particular purchase decision. The model built in this example will predict which product line is most likely to interest a given customer.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Stepping through the example process, we'll have the same training data and the same feature columns (as the prior example) but a different label column: <kbd>PRODUCT_LINE</kbd>. Also, in this example, rather than picking <span class="packt_screen">Automatic</span>, choose <span class="packt_screen">Manual</span> so that you can choose the specific algorithms the model uses.</p>
<p class="mce-root">So, to train this model, you will specify the preceding label and feature columns and then pick the machine learning technique: <span class="packt_screen">Multiclass Classification</span>. Another difference in this exercise is that we want to add two estimators (algorithm choices) for the model to use so that we can compare each performance:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root">Click <span class="packt_screen">Add Estimators</span> to view the estimators (algorithms) that are available to use with the multiclass classification technique in the model builder.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Click the card labeled <span class="packt_screen">Naive Bayes</span> and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Add</span>.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add Estimators</span> again.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Click the card labeled <span class="packt_screen">Random Forest Classifier</span> and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Add</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/654bcb99-8086-4b55-9908-6bd6d8dd4678.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root" style="padding-left: 60px">A neat feature with the model builder is that, after the training completes, you can see evaluations of both algorithm choices (as seen in the following screenshot):</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c6eaa13f-0403-457a-b5c8-8b04334cf19d.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In the preceding screenshot, you can see that the performance evaluation of the model using <span class="packt_screen">Naive Bayes</span> is rated as <span class="packt_screen">Poor</span>, while the performance of the model using random forest classification is <span class="packt_screen">Excellent</span>. Consider the following, as I have mentioned already in this chapter, and as is even stated in the product documentation.</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign packt_quote">"To find the best solution for a given machine learning problem, you sometimes have to experiment with your training data, the model design, and/or the algorithms used. With the model builder, you can easily compare the results of different algorithms used (to better understand what the best choice should be).”</div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">This is extremely good and practical advice, especially to those relatively new to machine learning.</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Let's now move on to the final topic of this chapter: regression.</p>

<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Regression is essentially a statistical approach used to find the relationship between variables. In machine learning, this is used to predict the outcome of an event based on the relationship between variables obtained from the dataset.</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">As we've seen with prior options for training a model, the product documentation gives us a very good example exercise we can use to illustrate the regression approach to machine learning: training a model to predict the amount of money a customer is likely to spend on a trip to an outdoor equipment store.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Again, we'll go over the appropriate steps required for this exercise. For this exercise, we will choose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><kbd>PURCHASE_AMOUNT</kbd> (which is the average amount of money the customer has spent on each visit to the store) as our label column </li>
<li class="mce-root"><kbd>GENDER</kbd>, <kbd>AGE</kbd>, <kbd>MARITAL_STATUS</kbd>, and <kbd>PROFESSION</kbd> as our feature columns</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, as in the preceding section's exercise, we will again click on <span class="packt_screen">Manual</span> so that we will be able to choose the specific algorithms the model uses (instead of letting the model builder chose for us), then perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root">For the <span class="packt_screen">Select a technique</span> option (shown in the following screenshot), select <span class="packt_screen">Regression</span>.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Add the estimator named <span class="packt_screen">Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor</span>. The following screenshot indicates the parameters we've chosen for this exercise model build:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/762d465d-3415-4e67-85eb-5161977edeea.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li class="mce-root">Once the preceding details are set, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to begin training the model with the sample data, using the selected technique and estimator. After training completes, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>. Of course, after the model is saved, the model details page opens automatically:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d1353dd7-f6d6-4839-b3ea-0d9b0888c94b.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li class="mce-root">In the usual fashion, to verify the algorithm the model builder used, you can again go to the <span class="packt_screen">Summary</span> table in the <span class="packt_screen">Overview</span> information on the model details page (shown in the following screenshot) and click on <span class="packt_screen">View</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Model builder details</span> row:</li>
</ol>

<p class="mce-root">Another useful feature of the model builder is that it provides you with the ability to easily test the predictive ability of a deployed model, without having to do any programming.</p>
<p class="mce-root">To test a deployed model from the deployment details page, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root">First, in the <span class="packt_screen">Test</span> area of the deployment details page, there will be a simple input form (see the following screenshot), where you can type in some values for the feature columns: <kbd>GENDER</kbd>, <kbd>AGE</kbd>, <kbd>MARITAL_STATUS</kbd>, and <kbd>PROFESSION</kbd> (you can ignore the other fields in the form):</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5217d02d-0f42-4c91-adcd-b31f91861498.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="2">
<li class="mce-root">Next, click on <span class="packt_screen">Predict</span> to create a prediction based upon the values that you just entered and the model you have built. This will be the prediction of how much money a customer with the entered attributes is likely to spend on a trip to the store. The following screenshot shows the result of a test. The predicted amount of spend is $118.81:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3710b002-8695-4dd3-a55e-ea99608b1166.png" style=""/></div>
<p class="mce-root">As the documentation suggests, you can take additional value combinations from the training file and enter them into the input data form to do additional testing.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we discussed the significance of model selection; specifically, selecting classification techniques and related estimators. We saw how using the IBM Cloud platform and Watson Studio offers a way to explore the performance of various techniques and estimators in an efficient and effective way. Using this easy exploration process, you can feel confident that your selected model fits to the data well. We also saw how to use Watson Studio to build, deploy, and test a model and configure it for continuous learning.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, we will discuss the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as looking at semi-supervised learning. Moreover, we will look at the concept of clustering algorithms, and examine online versus batch learning.</p>
