<p>This chapter will cover the strategies you can use to host applications, so that you can provide freedom to end users and full control to administrators. You will learn about business values by using AppDefense, which uses machine learning to create an intent-based manifest for an app running in a VM. It can properly secure the app against malicious behavior with an algorithm that measures the running state against the intended state.</p>
<p>After going through this chapter, you will have learned how to get relevant alerts in a security operations center by defining an application-centric policy to detect, protect, and enforce the desired state of an application. This will also help you to design a <strong><span>security operations center</span></strong> (<strong>SOC</strong>) based on a precise decision engine, rather than having to perform guesswork.</p>
<p><span>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</span></p>

<p>The problem lies in the existing security strategies that customers are employing to protect data center endpoints. We are specifically referring to the endpoints within the data center where applications are hosted, not end user endpoints, like laptops or phones.</p>
<p>The legacy approach to protecting applications is to monitor endpoints for known threat signatures. Think of antivirus software. AV software has a massive database of known malware signatures, which it uses to identify threats on an endpoint.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that if the security solution hasn't seen the threat before, there is no signature to match, and therefore, the threat will be missed. This means that any brand new (or zero-day) threats will go undetected.</p>
<p>ML approaches to endpoint threat detection have become more prominent in recent years, in order to address this problem of identifying unknown threats. The idea is that by aggregating data from as many parts of the environment as possible, machine learning and AI algorithms can be used to sort out and distinguish normal behaviors from threats. The problem with this approach is noise. These solutions take in so much data, from so many different corners of the environment, that it is incredibly difficult for them to accurately detect threats. As a result, they tend to produce a high number of false positives:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/16646b3e-cfff-46b2-b306-a7eff1928f02.png" style="width:37.08em;height:15.58em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Application security must evolve to keep up with the speed of modern development practices, and VMware has developed a unique approach to solving this problem. In contrast to traditional security solutions, which focus on chasing threats, VMware AppDefense leverages its position in the hypervisor to learn the intended state of an application and immediately <span>respond</span> to deviations from that state. This level of application visibility results in more accurate security policies and faster remediation, simplifying the prevention of malicious behavior. This result is a common source of truth for IT and security teams, making it easy for them to collaborate on compliance, security incident investigation, and incident response.</p>
<p>AppDefense builds context by gathering the inventory of virtual machines and the application details from automation and provisioning tools, such as vCenter, Puppet, and Ansible, in order to understand the intent of a particular machine and application. It then monitors the behavior of the VM, operating system, processes, and application, and correlates this information with the intent that's defined during provisioning. AppDefense creates a blueprint based on known good behavior for how the machine and application should be functioning and communicating, by using machine learning.</p>
<p>Once the blueprint has been established, it is stored in a secure partition of the hypervisor. AppDefense monitors for any changes, detecting and preventing any deviations from the intended, established state, ensuring the integrity of applications, infrastructures, and the operating system. When a threat is detected, it can natively respond through a variety of capabilities and through NSX Data Center for enforcement and containment.</p>

<p>VMware government solutions enable customers to securely modernize government IT, strengthen cybersecurity, and streamline operations across infrastructures, clouds, apps, and endpoints, with their data center transformation approach. Government customers can innovate IT for greater impact and deploy a digital-first vision to achieve mission objectives with VMware solutions.</p>
<p>New Technology is always the key enabler for customers to deliver same services in better way. IT modernization is now an integral component of the cybersecurity solution. IT is working harder than ever to meet increasing demands on infrastructure to develop costly, ineffective systems for modern, cloud-capable platforms that are able to support both legacy investments and next-generation applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>VMware provides a secure, practical, and accurate approach to modernizing the foundation of IT operations in the data center, by extending investments in compute virtualization to storage, networking, and management. The modern government data center is software-defined, virtualized, and centralized, providing customers with the availability, scalability, and operational efficiency that are needed to run today's dynamic services on demand. VMware's SDDC architecture leverages a globally consistent infrastructure to enable seamless application and workload portability across on-premises, private, and public clouds, enabling customers to operate a truly hybrid cloud environment with flexibility. This will ultimately span on-premises and public clouds across common infrastructure and management environments.</p>

<p>IT is <span><span>innovating</span></span> the way it delivers and supports applications, to keep up with mobile innovation and to better respond to internal requests for flexible access to government resources and services. Pivoting from a locked-down, hardened approach to mobility, customers are leveraging virtualization and the cloud to put the right apps and productivity solutions into the hands of the right users, at the right times. VMware digital workspace solutions empower government workforces to more effectively and efficiently serve citizens through secure, remote access to resources and data, across devices, locations, and applications. It transforms applications and IT service delivery for greater productivity and impact on mission programs.</p>
<p>As the foundation of a mobile workforce, the VMware digital workspace represents a fundamental shift in the way that applications and IT services are delivered and consumed. Based on a software-defined architecture, the digital workspace isolates applications from the operating system, enabling agile, over-the-air delivery and management of Windows, cloud-native, web, and mobile applications. Complimenting Microsoft's approach to managing Windows 10, VMware digital workspace solutions abstract device and application life cycle management to support Windows 10 PCs and applications over-the-air. An enterprise-secure application catalog, backed by identity-based access and unified endpoint management, provides users with a consumer-like work experience without compromising data security or compliance. It provides additional security features, including the full visibility and management of all endpoints, such as macOS and Windows desktop and laptop devices, device and data-level encryption, granular <strong>data loss prevention</strong> (<strong>DLP</strong>) policies, and automated compliance monitoring, to further protect data and prevent data loss.</p>

<p>Customers have to strengthen cybersecurity by reducing the total threat attack surface. They do this by transforming IT infrastructure and governance. Applications and data are living in increasingly stretched out and distributed IT environments; end users are no longer neatly contained behind perimeter firewalls, and attackers are smarter than ever, so cybersecurity efforts must bind more than just the core infrastructure by extending to the cloud, the user's identity, and their device. VMware helps customers to stay on top of changing security needs with a multilayered, software-defined approach to cybersecurity, which enhances the visibility and control of interactions between users, applications, and data.</p>
<p>Network virtualization reduces the risk and inefficiency that's inherent in a physical networking environment by embedding networking in the hypervisor and enabling micro-segmentation, which reduces the infrastructure's attack surface by ensuring that network, security, and automation policies follow the individual workload or application. This abstraction layer also provides a platform for IT to insert additional third-party services for more advanced security protection, and provides an ideal point to encrypt data at rest at the workload level.</p>
<p>With highly distributed computing environments, greater cross-organization and defense collaboration, and stricter privacy regulations, such as the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>), organizations must accommodate perimeterless computing. VMware helps IT to transform security by building on a virtualized foundation and moving to a security architecture that's layered, segmented, and policy-driven. VMware solutions work in tandem with traditional security measures to reduce the attack surface and prevent the lateral movement of threats.</p>

<p>AppDefense is based on the ML technique for threat detection and response solution. Customers trust digital information, but any data breach will impact their consumer confidence, as well as their reputation. Data is very critical for organizations to be competent in today's market, so data security cannot be compromised.</p>
<p>AppDefense helps organizations to solve a few challenges in relation to keeping their data safe. It is a data center endpoint security solution that has built-in threat detection and response solutions embedded into the vSphere kernel, with host applications and associated data. It consolidates intuitive information about the correct state with all required services on each end point. It can also detect unauthorized changes as it happens.</p>
<p>The following is a screenshot of an AppDefense dashboard with three uncleared alarms:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/203a57c9-acda-448f-82ec-4ef99c65c764.png" style="width:42.75em;height:27.92em;"/></p>
<p>VMware AppDefense focuses on validating the <em>known correct</em> parameters of an endpoint by removing the need to drill the whole environment, chasing <em>known</em> or <em>unknown incorrect</em> behaviors that might be a threat. Security teams can detect anomalies as true threats with full confidence by minimizing the occurrence of false positives. AppDefense resides in isolation from the attack surface, so that it can't be compromised itself.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>AppDefense raises a smart alarm, which is significant for the environment. Only trusted alerts with an automated response allow the security team to concentrate on finding and destroying threats from their environment as compared to searching for threats from incorrect data. SOC can use this tool to detect with trust and to automate responses to threats. The <strong>C</strong><span><strong>hief Information Security Officer</strong> (</span><strong>CISO</strong><span>) </span>organization is split into security architects and security operations. Security architects are responsible for devising the policies that are used to secure a given application, and security operations are responsible for actually monitoring and identifying threats in the environment.</p>
<p>Security architects review new applications and determine how they should be secured. Today, they have very little insight into how apps are composed, which processes should (or should not) be running, and how they should be communicating (and with whom), and they often don't even know who to go to for answers to their questions. The review process can take months, and often, the policies that they use are generic and focus on ensuring that the app is patched and that the logs are monitored.</p>
<p>With AppDefense, architects get a trusted manifest of the application's intended state and behavior from the outset, which allows them to define specific, app-centric policies that will remove the guesswork for the SOC when the app is ultimately deployed. This makes the review process more effective, less manual, and far quicker, which is particularly important as organizations move to more agile application development methods.</p>
<p>Once the app is deployed, it comes down to the SOC to detect when an app is compromised. Today, they are bombarded with false positives and a ton of noise that they need to make sense of. If they do find an issue, remediation is manual and labor-intensive. With AppDefense, when an alert comes in that something is wrong, the SOC can have faith that the alert is legitimate. Furthermore, they can automate the remediation actions so that the threat is neutralized quickly and efficiently, minimizing the damage that's done to the environment.</p>

<p>Apps are developed, changed, and destroyed rapidly within the DevOps environment. Application codes coming with enhanced features change frequently, and it's tough for security teams to have regular updates/knowledge about new amendments in applications. Customers can't take risks with their businesses by having critical data compromised, which may also damage their precious reputations. Customers have to ensure that the security services across all platforms tightly secure their network, applications, and data center endpoint positions.</p>
<p>It is possible for virtually anyone with a computer to initiate an attack against a specific organization, and new kinds of threats are being developed every day. We can't focus on following threats continuously to disrupt all of the challenges related to IT security.</p>
<p>CISOs are responsible for securing the applications and data that are residing in dynamic and distributed IT environments. Customers have to opt for new cloud-native application development processes, and must also implement security that strengthens their business objectives.</p>
<p>AppDefense protects applications with a specific approach, by <em>ensuring good</em> rather than <em>chasing bad</em>. AppDefense understands application behavior<span> with its objective and keeps a check against application desired state.</span> AppDefense automates responses when applications are manipulated. This is a simple and powerful tool that shrinks the attack surface by providing more context and controls.</p>
<p>AppDefense can also work in container environments and assist customers in securing their applications on any platforms, across regional boundaries. AppDefense provides a base layer to secure data center applications. AppDefense is the only solution that can span across all platforms with a consistent approach to discovering context, defining rules with alerts, and remediation. Customers can initiate least-privilege enforcement across all of their applications by integrating container support.</p>

<p>The security team can use AppDefense to establish the security review process for customers with frequent application development and deployment processes.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Applications and infrastructures expand more rapidly today, due to ever-changing end user demands. This will challenge security teams to leave their traditional, manual ways of investigating and managing amendments when applications are regularly being revamped and redeployed. The security team should understand what the application intends to do and define a security policy for its desired state.</p>
<p>We use AppDefense by integrating it into the CI/CD pipeline with provisioning tools and automation frameworks. We can define the desired state with real-time monitoring by maintaining a trusted map of an intended state that keeps in sync with on-demand application teams, in order to support the DevSecOps approach.</p>

<p>AppDefense exposes an API that enables container security partners to integrate into the platform. AppDefense can get a workload context from container orchestration systems, and can also configure policies that are enforced by container security vendors.</p>
<p>Aqua Security is one of the third-party tools that can integrate with the AppDefense container ecosystem; it enables runtime assurance for containers when the containers execute by investigating and enforcing behaviors. AppDefense along with Aqua Security will help container runtime profiles so that VMware can manage/maintain security scopes across the data center, and Aqua will also transfer compelling alerts to the AppDefense, console for management and resolution. Containers come with an automation engine and defined techniques for the desired state by integrating into container security solutions that can extend into a mixed cloud model.</p>
<p>AppDefense supports the VMware vCenter inventory for container workloads that are running across all platforms, like virtual servers, bare metal servers, and any cloud environments. AppDefense is available to customers in Europe via support from European-based data centers that support the data localization policy.</p>
<p><span>The <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>) (Regulation [EU] 2016/679) is a regulation that builds up and merges data privacy rights for people within the European Union. GDPR also focuses on the export of personal data outside of EU regional boundaries. The GDPR's first objective to have control over personal data, such as the name, address, and national identity numbers of the individual, which is a basic right, and also makes it simple to understand the regulatory environment for global business by coordinating data protection prescriptions within all EU countries.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>The GDPR extends the scope of current EU data protection laws to non-EU organizations that are processing personal EU data. The coordination of data protection ratification should make it simpler for non-EU organizations to comply with a tight data protection compliance authority, with maximum punishment for non-compliance. VMware will be aligned with the European Union's GDPR.</span></p>
<p>VMware can tackle the export of personal data from the EU by constructing its compliance framework within the standard contractual clauses. We can guarantee a high level of protection for a customers' personal data, as needed, under current EU laws. VMware's standard contractual has clauses like internal consensus for the global movement of personal data between VMware and its subsidiaries across the globe. VMware's customers depend on VMware's certification underneath the Safe Harbor plan, with reference to VMware's processing of customer personal data. VMware's internal standard contractual clauses can be utilized by any of VMware's customers.</p>
<p>VMware helps customers to align with the GDPR regarding data security, so that customers can exchange ideas with privacy experts and enforce business processes by supporting the intended law.</p>
<p>AppDefense is a cloud-based security tool with many advantages, but it's important to have local data centers for performance and data localization. European customers have to obey regulatory compliance regarding data localization. AppDefense services will only be delivered to customers in Europe from European-based local data centers. AppDefense has launched a critical cloud security service to maximize customers across the globe with regional data centers.</p>
<p>The Indian government also has this policy that they can only take services from cloud service providers that have datacenters in India.</p>
<p>AppDefense collects and leverages end user and business data, from a compliance perspective. It is also used with different global data laws/regulations. AppDefense collects the customer email addresses for authentication, which are then placed into the service and examined for personally identifiable information. AppDefense also fetches hostnames, IP addresses, and process information from customer protected applications. All these critical data are important from compliance perspective. AppDefense supports applications that are hosted in the different kinds of clouds.</p>

<p>Most of the security breaches cannot be tackled with a point product (can only handle single problem and not have complete solution) or tool, as these are more basic and architectural in character. AppDefense makes security an inherent part of the network and application fabric where in businesses are running. Security is a native part of data center endpoints, which consist of applications, by implanting AppDefense within vSphere kernel. AppDefense helps its customers tackle the growing frequency and costs of security incident points in security models, which mostly <span>focus</span> on unidentified threats. AppDefense conveys a purpose-based security model that determines what the applications are supposed to do—the known correct. Compare this to what the hackers will do—the known incorrect.</p>

<p>AppDefense shield applications run in vSphere environments and various cloud environments. NSX and AppDefense complement each other, but NSX is not mandatory for AppDefense services. If AppDefense is integrated with NSX, automated response techniques like automatically quarantine a compromised data center endpoint can be leveraged. AppDefense is outstanding in a new security model which has a native, purpose-based, and application-centric approach. AppDefense will do the same job for compute that NSX does for the network, by creating least-privilege environments for business applications. We can monitor running applications against their desired states and can investigate them with an automated response to attacks that try to exploit applications.</p>
<p>AppDefense is distinctive, as it is located in the hypervisor kernel to better interpret the desired state and conduct of a data center endpoint. It monitors endpoints in real time for unapproved changes from the <em>known correct</em> state. AppDefense uses vSphere with NSX for automated responses when a threat is detected for applications.</p>
<p>AppDefense complements a number of security solutions, but it competes with two main endpoint security solutions, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy signature-based products (antivirus, anti-malware, IPS, and so on)</li>
<li>Next-generation endpoint security (<strong>Endpoint Detection and Response</strong> (<strong>EDR</strong>), machine learning, behavioral analytics, and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p>AppDefense is evolving from the preceding solutions by recognizing deviations from the application's desired state, as compared to following possible warnings. AppDefense also has automated response capabilities, which can be integrated with other security tools in various aspects.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>VMware assists its customers with security and data protection features, from the data center to the end user. It secures a customers' environments end to end, by identifying potential data protection gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data access and data transfer (using VMware NSX)</strong>: Creating security policies to prevent data movement across unapproved networks</li>
<li><strong>Data access (using Horizon and Workspace ONE)</strong>: Creating a policy engine to impose role-based access to data with identity checks and validation</li>
<li><strong>Data storage (using VMware vSphere and vSAN)</strong>: Enabling data encryption</li>
<li><strong>Data deletion (using VMware vSphere and AirWatch)</strong>: Wipe out data, including individual data</li>
</ul>
<p>AppDefense differs from Microsoft's <strong>virtualization-based security</strong> (<strong>VBS</strong>) tools, like Device Guard, Credential Guard, and AppLocker, since these are built for Windows only, and will not support Linux workloads. Additionally, none of these solutions are designed to detect and respond to threats on data center endpoints. VBS uses the hypervisor to help protect the kernel and other parts of the operating system. AppDefense is focused on the application. Protecting the application means protecting the integrity and behavior of the application components, not just the OS. AppDefense provides OS protection, even if VBS is not present or enabled. AppDefense also provides the SOC with the ability to detect and respond to any compromises. Device Guard is focused on whitelisting which executables are allowed to run on a machine. It does not perform behavior whitelisting. It doesn't take an application-centric view of creating, updating, and monitoring these policies. It doesn't support automated response integration. All of these are essential parts of delivering a solution that can be used efficiently by SOCs. AppLocker is the older application whitelisting solution that's focused on end user endpoints, and it suffers from all of the problems that is had with traditional whitelisting. There is significant confusion about when to use AppLocker, as opposed to Device Guard.</p>
<p>AppDefense does whitelisting and behavioral analysis for an application. Traditional whitelisting is based on monitoring and validating what is allowed to be installed on a machine. However, this approach misses the behavioral component. What is the machine allowed to do? AppDefense incorporates both of these components into its approach to determine the application's intended state. AppDefense also takes a holistic view of application behavior, rather than focusing solely on individual data center endpoints. AppDefense stores VM inventory, machine names, expected process behaviors, expected network flows, and security alarms in the cloud. AppDefense holds metadata about the customer's data center environment and security status. AppDefense won't store any application data in the cloud, and does not handle any actual application data from customers. The only data that's stored is what is required to maintain the security posture of the infrastructure.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We secure the information that's stored in the cloud because we take the security of the AppDefense service very seriously. The service is managed and protected by the VMware SOC, which is the same team that manages the security of all of VMware's Cloud Services, as well as VMware's on-premises data centers. Any configuration changes or behaviors within AWS are closely monitored by the SOC and require an authorized change control process. All data is sent to and from the AppDefense service via encrypted tunnels, and all of the data that's stored is encrypted at rest. </p>
<p>AppDefense uses third-party service providers and makes use of a select few third-party SaaS services. All third-party vendors are vetted by internal security and legal teams and have a data privacy agreement in place with VMware.</p>
<p>AppDefense is managed from the cloud, and customers get a number of benefits by consuming AppDefense as an SaaS service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security teams are not required to deploy, manage, and maintain software, which is not typically their core competency.</li>
<li>Customers get the benefit of the collective knowledge of the vSphere installed base. This means that we can baseline behaviors running across a large number of machines from different tenants, in order to recognize anomalies and security threats more quickly.</li>
<li>A cloud delivery model allows us to update and change some of the anomaly detection logic on a regular basis, without requiring customers to install and manage software updates.</li>
<li>Delivering as a cloud service allows customers to manage the security postures of their environments from a single location.</li>
</ul>
<p>AppDefense understands the application's intended state, and the application's intended state includes application composition information like the VMs, services, and binaries that make up the application, in addition to other software that co-resides with in the core application, like security and management software. It also includes behavioral information, like the network interactions between the various processes. AppDefense also ties into provisioning systems like vRealize Automation, Puppet, and others, to get composition information about the intended state. It then augments that with the runtime discovery of behavior to create a comprehensive and verified intended state. If a VM moves between hosts or clusters using vMotion, the AppDefense policy moves with it, similar to NSX. The administrative domain boundary for AppDefense is vCenter, so moving VMs across vCenters is not currently supported.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Intended application changes that may create false alerts come in two forms: updates to software and behavior that was not exhibited during the learning period. To limit false alarms, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend an extended and variable learning period for applications</li>
<li>We support wildcards and do smart and auto-wild carding</li>
</ul>
<p>AppDefense won't consume a lot of system resources on the endpoint or the host, as it is surprisingly lightweight and consumes minimal resources on the host. AppDefense uses the simple method of understanding the intended state of an application and monitoring for changes, rather than relying on complex algorithms and computation, which is how other next-generation endpoint security solutions typically work. AppDefense integrates with <strong>s</strong><span><strong>ecurity information and event management</strong> (</span><strong>SIEM</strong><span>)</span> and other next-generation security solutions, as it is an open platform that allows SIEMs and other security systems to consume its alarms and application context information, as well as leverage its automated response capabilities.</p>
<p>AppDefense integrates with configuration management tools, orchestration engines, and cloud management portals by integrating with DevOps automation tools to get trusted intended state data. You can also integrate with vRealize Automation and add support for tools like Puppet for automated provisioning and orchestration. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The environment preparation for AppDefense deployment is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1</strong>:
<ul>
<li> Install vCenter</li>
<li> Install ESXi Hosts</li>
<li> Install NSX Manager</li>
<li> Install vRealize Automation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Install and deploy AppDefense components</strong>: The application and infrastructure team is responsible for the installation and support of the AppDefense platform components and for selecting the target application. Provisioning the target applications to be tested against and simulating standard changes to provisioned applications are also performed by the application team. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Provision AppDefense login</li>
<li>Download AppDefense appliance</li>
<li>Deploy AppDefense appliance OVA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">AppDefense deployment will be successful if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>AppDefense is successfully deployed (all components) in the environment</li>
<li>AppDefense is successfully connected to all external components (vCenter, NSX, and vRA)</li>
<li>VM inventory from vCenter is visible from the AppDefense management console</li>
<li>The key workflows that are described should be completed successfully</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It starts with capturing the intended purpose, state, and behavior of your virtual machines. Here, we are leveraging a unique property of vSphere, which is application visibility. The hypervisor allows you to see both the runtime state (what's running in the VM) and the provisioned state (what was provisioned there in the first place).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 3</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Provision an AppDefense Manager instance</li>
<li>Copy UUID and API-KEY</li>
<li>Modify the <kbd>application.properties</kbd> file</li>
<li>Verify AppDefense Appliance connectivity</li>
<li>Verify NSX Manager connectivity</li>
<li>Verify vRealize Orchestrator connectivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Complete the AppDefense deployment by configuring AppDefense components</strong>: <span>All of the technical requirements for these solutions (IP addresses, DNS, VMs, NTP, and so on) need to be fulfilled. The customer has to help the implementation team by reviewing the permitted behavior practices in their environment, configuring protection policies, monitoring the protected application, and testing detection capabilities, using VMware provided tools, internal tools, or manually triggering violations. Running and protecting the test applications with AppDefense installed will be evaluated from time to time, depending on the current and upcoming security threats.</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 4</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Install the host module on the ESXi hosts</li>
<li>Deploy a guest module to application servers</li>
<li>Enable guest integrity</li>
<li>Verify that the application servers show a ready status</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Create an application scope with foundational detection and response capabilities</strong>: <span>At the core of AppDefense is the definition of the application's intended state. The intended state includes the application's composition, process-level, inbound and outbound connection behavior, and their relationship in the context of a broader application, as these apps are used to connect or integrate as per customer demand. One or more of these methods will be used to create the intended state during deployment.</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 5</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Create a scope in AppDefense for application</li>
<li>Create services in AppDefense for application</li>
<li>Verify that the capture process has been running for a few weeks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Create an application scope</strong>: <span>You can utilize infrastructure blueprints from vRealize Automation to create services and application scopes/composition in AppDefense, and you can also manually define the application composition in AppDefense.</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 6</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Create a multi-machine blueprint</li>
<li>Tag VMs in the blueprint with scope and service</li>
<li>Verify the scope creation in AppDefense</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Verify and protect mode</strong>: We can get <span>Application behavior by running AppDefense discovery mode on the application for a few weeks for automatically learning the application behavior.

<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 7</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Verify behaviors</li>
<li>Add/modify/remove behaviors, as necessary</li>
<li>Change action to verify and protect</li>
<li>Observe default rule violations in alert logs</li>
</ul>
