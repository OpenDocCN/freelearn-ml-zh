    a good **Convolutional Neural Network** (**CNN**) takes a lot of expertise and
    resources. Moreover, it also requires a large number of labeled images with objects.
    Amazon has an out-of-box solution for image recognition, called **Amazon Rekognition**,
    that offers various tools for image recognition using pretrained image recognition
    models.

    you need a large, labeled dataset in order to train the deep learning model to
    perform specific tasks. Secondly, you need knowledge of how to design a network
    and tune the parameters to get the best accuracy. Finally, training such deep
    learning models at scale requires expensive GPU-based clusters to train these
    models.

    is a tool offered by AWS featuring image recognition models that are already pretrained
    for use in your applications. Amazon Rekognition models are based on an analysis
    of billions of videos and images. Similar to how **Amazon Comprehend** offers
    NLP models as a service, Rekognition offers various image recognition models that
    can perform specific tasks. The advantage of using Amazon Rekognition is that
    you can simply use dashboards and APIs to perform image recognition tasks at high
    accuracy, without the high-level expertise required to train such machine learning
    models.

- en: Object and scene detection algorithms can recognize various objects in the image
    and assign confidence to each prediction. This algorithm uses a hierarchy of labels
    to label objects and returns all the nodes of the leaf when it detects an object.
    Object detection is a classic application of image recognition. It allows us to
    identify what is inside an image and label it. For example, consider a newsroom
    where photographers are submitting hundreds of images and videos every day. You
    need people to label such images so that if you wish to access an image of a celebrity
    who was pictured during a car crash, these image libraries can be searchable.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Object detection allows you to automatically label these images so that they
    can be stored, organized, and retrieved efficiently. One of the key features of
    an object detection algorithm is that they have to be comprehensive and should
    be able to detect a large array of objects. Moreover, such algorithms also detect
    the edges of the object and should be able to return the bounding box for an object.
    Amazon Rekognition performs both these tasks effectively.

    to use the API if you want to analyze multiple images.

- en: As you can see from the preceding screenshot, the object detection tool returns
    a ranked list of objects in the image along with the confidence of detection.
    As we mentioned previously, since the tool uses a hierarchy of categories, it
    may detect similar categories at the top. For example, it was able to detect the
    boat in the image. However, it also returned Vehicle and Transportation categories
    with the same confidence score. We can also see that the demo shows bounding boxes
    for each of the objects that it detected in the image.

    handles one image at a time. So, we can also use an API to access the Amazon Rekognition
    tool. You need to upload your images to a folder in S3 bucket in order to use
    object detection on them.

    in the image. The response provides the bounding box for each of the objects found
    in the image. Moreover, you can observe that the boat in the far right is small,
    so the confidence in detecting it is much lower than the other two boats in the
    image. The response also returned the parents of the object in the hierarchy.
    So, if you have hundreds of images to categorize, you can add them all to an S3
    bucket and use this code to iterate through them and detect labels for those objects.
    Because of tools such as Amazon Rekognition, data scientists now have access to
    world-class deep learning models that they can apply in the tools that they are
    building. However, such an object detection algorithm only works for a limited
    number of objects. For example, we tried the algorithm on x-ray images of cancer
    in this tool and it was not able to return any results. If you are working on
    a very specialized product where you are trying to detect medical images of tumors
    or images from a space telescope, you would need to train your own models based
    on a large number of labeled images.

    on images. It can predict interesting attributes such as age and gender based
    on looking at the image. It can also detect features such as a smile or whether
    the person is wearing glasses from this model. Such models would be trained by
    analyzing a lot of labeled facial images and training an image recognition model
    to recognize these features. The CNN models that we studied in [Chapter 7](c832a5c1-d877-4c90-bfb5-e3a0fe99d19a.xhtml),
    *Implementing Deep Learning Algorithms*, would be a good fit for such applications
    as it can automatically generate feature maps using local receptive fields methodology
    from the image and detect boxes that would contain evidence of these facial features.

    creates a correct box around it. It correctly predicted that the image is female
    and predicts an age range for that person. It predicted that the person in the
    image is not smiling. It also correctly predicted that the person is not wearing

    This can be done by an image recognition model learning from labeled images and
    videos. Deep learning algorithms can automatically extract facial features and
    then compare them to predict who the celebrity may be. For example, many of the
    movies and TV shows on services such as Amazon Prime can show the names of actors
    on the screen using this technique. Manually labeling these scenes with the names
    of actors may be a very tedious task; however, deep learning algorithms can do
    this automatically.

    and detect faces that are similar. For example, your Facebook account automatically
    matches the faces in an image you upload with your friends and tags the images
    automatically. They use such image recognition algorithms to train models for
    each face and run those models on your uploaded images to detect whether your
    friends are in that picture. Amazon Rekognition also offers a feature called **face
    comparison** that compares faces between two images and detects whether the same
    people appear in both pictures.

    Deep Learning with TensorFlow on AWS*, where our model was able to detect numbers.
    This tool is also very useful for reading text in the real world. Applications
    such as Google Translate can analyze camera images and can translate them to your
    native language. Self-driving cars can also use this technology to read road signs
    and react accordingly.
