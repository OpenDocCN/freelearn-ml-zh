<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>The impact of the video game industry</h1>
<p>In this section, we will understand why video games present an ideal medium for synthetic <span class="No-Break">data generation.</span></p>
<p>Video games are interactive<a id="_idIndexMarker365"/> electronic games used primarily for entertainment. The player usually interacts with game elements to achieve an objective. The volume, quality, and quantity of games released each year have grown exponentially in recent years. Video games are now utilized in education, training, rehabilitation, personal development, and just recently in <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) research. Specifically, they are presented as a rich and excellent synthetic data resource for training and testing <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
<p>Synthetic data generation <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>approaches such as simulators and GANs are promising and present a clever solution for generating large-scale and automatically annotated datasets; refer to <em class="italic">Chapters 6</em> and <em class="italic">7</em>. However, they still have a few limitations due to the complexity, time, and effort required to set up the data generation system. Some of these limitations can be summarized in <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Photorealism and <span class="No-Break">domain shift</span></li>
<li>Time, effort, <span class="No-Break">and cost</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s discuss these limitations one by one in <span class="No-Break">more detail.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Photorealism and the real-synthetic domain shift</h2>
<p>For synthetic <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>data to be useful, most often, it needs to be photorealistic. However, attaining a high level of photorealism is not simple. If you recall, we briefly<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> discussed these points in <a href="B18494_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>. It requires skilled engineers, artists, designers, experts in lighting and animation, and others to achieve this aim. In addition, the hardware to run these state-of-the-art game engines, the game engine itself, the tools, and the assets to build a rich and realistic virtual world are expensive and require extensive training. For example, the <em class="italic">Wacom Cintiq Pro 24”</em> costs more than £2,200 and requires months of training. This and similar devices are essential to create 3D content for games. Please refer to <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 – An example of a tool needed for 3D or 2D workflows in games</p>
<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>are the system requirements to run <span class="No-Break">Unreal </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker370"/></span><span class="No-Break">Engine:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 64-bit, quad-core Intel or AMD, 2.5 GHz or faster, 8 <span class="No-Break">GB RAM</span></li>
<li>macOS Big Sur, quad-core Intel, 2.5 GHz or faster, 8 <span class="No-Break">GB RAM</span></li>
<li>Linux Ubuntu 18.04, quad-core Intel or AMD, 2.5 GHz or faster, 32 <span class="No-Break">GB RAM</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Budgeting for the software, hardware, and experts to create a system for synthetic data generation may not be feasible for small-sized companies and research groups. Failing to maintain the required photorealism causes ML models to struggle at generalizing from synthetic to real data. Thus, it limits the usability of the generated synthetic data in <span class="No-Break">real-world applications.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Time, effort, and cost</h2>
<p>Creating the multi-purpose<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> simulator <em class="italic">CARLA</em> (<a href="https://carla.org">https://carla.org</a>) required 40-50 researchers, developers, and artists. It took several years of consistent work to <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>develop this useful system for synthetic data generation. Similarly, GANs require a considerable amount of time and effort to design and train. Additionally, significant computational and data storage resources are required for the training. Ethical considerations are other issues with this approach of synthetic data generation. Intellectual property issues and bias are examples of <span class="No-Break">these concerns.</span></p>
<p>Searching for an ideal synthetic data generation approach is still a hot topic and a problem that is partially solved. The recent advancements in the game industry motivated researchers to explore the potential of using video games to generate synthetic data. The number of users in the video game industry is expected to reach 3.1 billion by 2027. The projected market volume is expected to achieve more than £380 billion by 2027. For more details, refer<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> to <em class="italic">Statista Video Games </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Worldwide</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/worldwide"><span class="No-Break">https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/worldwide</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>global market, the great advancement in technology, and the increasing demand for more photorealistic and engaging games opened the doors for researchers, game developers, game studios, investors, and game publishers to push the boundaries for creating unprecedented and ground-breaking photorealistic and diverse virtual worlds and games. Now, you understand why video games present an elegant solution to generating synthetic data. In the next section, we will go into more detail on how to utilize video games for synthetic <span class="No-Break">data generation.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Generating synthetic data using video games</h1>
<p>This synthetic<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> data generation approach transfers the<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> problem from creating virtual worlds to generate synthetic data to manipulating a video game to generate synthetic data instead. This method presents a convenient and efficient way to generate synthetic data.

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.2 – Examples of video game genres</p>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>diversity in video game genres, as shown<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, makes generating various and rich synthetic data by utilizing video games a more attractive option for researchers. There are various ways to leverage video games in ML applications, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing games for general <span class="No-Break">data collection</span></li>
<li>Utilizing games for <span class="No-Break">social studies</span></li>
<li>Utilizing simulation games for <span class="No-Break">data generation</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss these <span class="No-Break">in detail.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Utilizing games for general data collection</h2>
<p>Modern video <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>games collect data about players for various reasons, such as controlling the game difficulty, customizing the game experience, and personalizing advertisements based on users’ data. The collected data by these games can be leveraged for other purposes beyond the game itself. The data collected can include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break">Biometric data</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Demographic data</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Gameplay data</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how this data can <span class="No-Break">be used.</span></p>
<h3>Biometric data</h3>
<p>Game <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>developers may collect players’ biometric data to assess their engagement and may control certain aspects of the game based on the player’s emotions, excitement, and confusion. The biometric data collected by some modern video games can include eye movements, heart rate, head and hand movements, and <strong class="bold">electroencephalography</strong> (<strong class="bold">EEG</strong>) signals. EEG signals <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>are electrical waves generated by the brain when performing activities such as attention, reading, and sleeping. This<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> includes video games such as <em class="italic">Nevermind</em>, <em class="italic">Far Cry 6</em>, and <em class="italic">X-Plane 12</em>. <em class="italic">Nevermind </em>(<a href="https://nevermindgame.com">https://nevermindgame.com</a>) is the first physiological biofeedback adventure video game. It captures the player’s heart rate using a heart rate sensor to assess fear, anxiety, and stress during playtime. The collected data can be utilized for a wide range of experiments, such as <em class="italic">Video Games and Stress: How Stress Appraisals and Game Content Affect Cardiovascular and Emotion Outcomes </em>(<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00967/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00967/full</a>) and <em class="italic">Interaction Effects of Action Real-Time Strategy Game Experience and Trait Anxiety on Brain Functions Measured via EEG </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Rhythm </em></span><span class="No-Break">(</span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/27706710.2023.2176004"><span class="No-Break">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/27706710.2023.2176004</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h3>Demographic data</h3>
<p>Video<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> games can be considered a rich source of demographic data. Widespread global players provide valuable information about their age, gender, location, language, occupation, and other valuable information <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>such as <strong class="bold">Personal Identifiable Information</strong> (<strong class="bold">PII</strong>). Some video games, such as <em class="italic">Minecraft </em>and <em class="italic">The Sims 4,</em> utilize the collected demographic data to improve the player experience and enhance engagement. Thus, some video games may remove violence, blood, and mature language for players under 7 years old. They may activate or deactivate certain features based on the demographic data collected, such as in-game chat and purchases and <span class="No-Break">maturity filters.</span></p>
<h3>Gameplay data</h3>
<p>Games may<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> collect data explicitly by asking questions to users or by using sensors, and implicitly by observing the behavior of the player in the virtual world including interaction, choices, learning, and progress. Gameplay data provides valuable resources to customize your game and improve the overall gameplay and user experience. Examples of these games are <em class="italic">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>, <em class="italic">Fortnite</em>, <em class="italic">League of Legends</em>, and <em class="italic">World of Warcraft</em>. The game developers leverage the collected data during playtime to balance gameplay mechanics and difficulty and identify weak features, issues, <span class="No-Break">and bugs.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Utilizing games for social studies</h2>
<p>Games <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>have been utilized in the field of social studies as a source of synthetic data. For example, educational games were deployed by researchers to understand more about learning experiences, compare and contrast teaching methods, and analyze learning environments and learning tools. For more information about utilizing games in social<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> studies, refer to <em class="italic">Teaching Social Studies with </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Games</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://www.igi-global.com/article/teaching-social-studies-with-games/201873"><span class="No-Break">https://www.igi-global.com/article/teaching-social-studies-with-games/201873</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<p>In some games, such<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> as <em class="italic">Civilization V</em> (<a href="https://civilization.com/en-GB/civilization-5">https://civilization.com/en-GB/civilization-5</a>), the players build and control a civilization. They need to make decisions, plan, conduct diplomacy, and make plans for the future. Observing and recording the players’ behaviors and combining it with the demographic data collected from the players present an excellent and rich source of data for social studies researchers. Other similar games, such<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> as <em class="italic">Spent</em> (<a href="https://playspent.org">https://playspent.org</a>), also provide valuable synthetic data on how players respond to challenges and how they make decisions with a <span class="No-Break">limited budget.</span></p>
<p>As expected, the standard methods of collecting data for social studies are surveys and interviews. They are hard to design, time-consuming, and expensive. In addition to that, they are <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>not pleasant and enjoyable to do. Thus, wrong or inaccurate feedback or data is expected. On the other hand, games present an interactive, realistic, and enjoyable experience, which makes the feedback and data generated more accurate, detailed, <span class="No-Break">and valuable.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Utilizing simulation games for data generation</h2>
<p>Simulation <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>games create parts of the real world that can be leveraged to teach players something, equip them with new skills, or sharpen their knowledge and skills. Simulators generate synthetic data from two sources: the environment and the behavior of the player in the simulation game. The simulated environment gives valuable information such as semantic labels of the objects, weather conditions, and scene crowdedness. On the other hand, the behavior of the player includes how the player approaches the problem, time spent, resources utilized, decisions made, and communication with other players in <span class="No-Break">the game.</span></p>
<p>As you now understand, the collected data inside the video games can be utilized for many purposes such as training ML models. However, game developers must consider data regulations to ensure they do not violate or breach them. In the next section, you will learn about the main limitations of this synthetic data <span class="No-Break">generation approach.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Challenges and limitations</h1>
<p>In this section, we explore the main challenges<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> of this synthetic data <span class="No-Break">generation approach.</span></p>
<p>Similar to other synthetic data generation approaches, utilizing video games for this purpose has some challenges. The main challenges and drawbacks can be summarized <span class="No-Break">as follows.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Controllability</h2>
<p>One of the main advantages of using <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>synthetic data is the ability to customize and fully control each aspect of this process. However, with video games not deployed for research purposes, the 3D virtual world and the scene elements are already created, fixed, and hard to change. Thus, it is not easy to add or remove certain objects <span class="No-Break">and actions.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Game genres and limitations on synthetic data generation</h2>
<p>Depending <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>on the game market, some game genres are more popular than others. For example, <em class="italic">action</em>, <em class="italic">sports</em>,<em class="italic"> role-playing</em>, and <em class="italic">first-person shooter</em> games are more popular compared to <em class="italic">t</em><em class="italic">ext-based adventure</em> and <em class="italic">music</em> and <em class="italic">rhythm</em>. Thus, generating synthetic data for certain applications may not be feasible given the limited availability of suitable <span class="No-Break">video games.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Realism</h2>
<p>As we have <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>mentioned earlier, realism is important to bridge the gap between synthetic and real domains. Many state-of-the-art and best-selling games are far from being realistic games. Examples of these games are <em class="italic">PUBG</em>, <em class="italic">Minecraft</em>, and <em class="italic">Red Dead Redemption</em>. Players usually value gameplay, plot, and narrative more than photorealism in games. Achieving realistic graphics in video games is an extremely challenging process and may not be rewarding to <span class="No-Break">games studios.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Ethical issues</h2>
<p>Utilizing a<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> video game for synthetic data generation is a complex topic. Using the players’ data outside of the game for research or commercial projects may cause privacy issues. Training on synthetic data generated from video games will inherently make ML models trained on this data source more accurate at demographic groups usually playing video games and less with other groups who do not. For example, a face recognition system trained exclusively on synthetic data generated by video games may perform well on young adults but may struggle with older adults who do not usually play video games. Please refer to <em class="italic">Distribution of video gamers in the United States in 2022, by age </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">group</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players"><span class="No-Break">https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Intellectual property</h2>
<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>cannot utilize video games for synthetic data generation without permission from the creators of the game, as the creators of the game usually have exclusive rights to reproduce the game. Intellectual properties and copyrights may be violated if we modify the <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>game and utilize it for other aims. At the same time, the data generated from the game itself might be subject to the same copyrights <span class="No-Break">or license.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we have learned how video games present a valuable source of synthetic data. We learned that biometric, demographic, and gameplay data can be collected from video games and can be utilized for myriads of ML-based applications. We gained insight into how and why various types of data about the player can be collected from video games. Finally, we discussed the main limitations of using video games for synthetic <span class="No-Break">data generation.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will delve into another method for generating synthetic data, using <span class="No-Break">diffusion models.</span></p>
