- en: '**Elías F. Combarro** holds degrees from the University of Oviedo (Spain) in
    both mathematics (1997, award for second highest grades in the country) and computer
    science (2002, award for highest grades in the country). After carrying out several
    stays as a visiting researcher at the Novosibirsk State University (Russia), he
    obtained a PhD in mathematics (Oviedo, 2001) with a dissertation on the properties
    of some computable predicates under the supervision of Prof. Andrey Morozov and
    Prof. Consuelo Martínez.'

- en: He completed his physics bachelor thesis under the supervision of Prof. Elías
    F. Combarro, Prof. Ignacio F. Rúa (University of Oviedo), and Dr. Sofia Vallecorsa
    (CERN). In it, he worked alongside other researchers from ETH Zürich on the application
    of quantum machine learning to classification problems in high energy physics.
    In 2021, he was a summer student at CERN developing a benchmarking framework for
    quantum simulators. He has contributed to several conferences on quantum computing
    and related fields.
