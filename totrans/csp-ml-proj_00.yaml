- en: In the era of data, it is hard to overlook the importance of **machine learning**
    (**ML**) and data science. ML has been used and adopted widely across many industries,
    and its adoption rate is growing faster than ever. Not only big technology companies,
    such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple, but also many non-technology companies such
    as Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs, invest heavily in ML. From searching for what
    to eat for dinner tonight on search engines to getting approvals for new credit
    cards, the applications of ML are everywhere in our daily lives. As a fellow data
    scientist and ML practitioner, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of ML
    in the current era of data, especially of big data.

    place. For many aspiring data scientists and ML practitioners, the amount of resources
    for applied ML in C# is lacking in the ML books out there. You can easily find
    books that have detailed explanations on the theory behind ML. You can also easily
    find books that touch the practical aspects of ML in different programming languages,
    such as Python. However, as you might have noticed, there are not many books that
    cover how to build practical ML models and applications using C#.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we are going to focus on the practical side of ML and dive right
    into building ML models and applications for various real-world projects that
    are actively being researched and built in many different industries. By going
    through real-life examples of ML with real-world datasets, you will understand
    how other data scientists and ML practitioners actually build ML models and applications
    for their production systems. This book is unique in the sense that each chapter
    is an individual ML project that has a real-world business use case.

    to work on. You might ask, *Why C#?* The answer is actually quite straightforward.
    As you might know already, C# is one of the most popular and widely used languages
    in the industry. Especially among finance companies, C# is one of the very few
    programming languages that is commonly accepted and used for their production
    applications.

    my career in data science. At that time, there was a discrepancy between what
    was taught in schools and what really works in real life (and how). In this book,
    I would like to share the knowledge and experience that I had to learn the hard
    way.  In this book, we are going to discuss things that are not frequently talked
    about, such as how ML projects typically start, how ML models are built and tested
    in different industries, how ML applications are then deployed on production systems,
    and how those ML models running in production systems are monitored and evaluated.
    We are going to work together throughout this book to help you get ready for any
    ML projects that you may come across in the future. By the end of this book, you
    will be able to build robust and well-performing ML models and applications using
    C#.

- en: This book is for those who know how to write code using C# and have a basic
    understanding of ML. Even if you do not have in-depth knowledge of the theories
    behind ML algorithms, don't worry! It is okay. This book will help you understand
    how you can use different learning algorithms for different use cases. If you
    have studied ML, maybe at school, on online courses, or at data science boot camps,
    then this book will be great for you. This book will show you how to actually
    apply the ML theories and concepts you have learned by going through nine real-world
    ML projects with real-world datasets. If you are already an ML practitioner, you
    will still greatly benefit from this book! By going through various real-world
    examples of applied ML, this book will help you expand your knowledge and experience
    of applying ML to various other business cases for many different industries.

    of the steps laid out in each chapter. Following through the code samples and
    running them on your own will help you understand better and get more comfortable
    with building ML models faster. I also recommend that you be adventurous and mix
    up the techniques and learning algorithms discussed in different chapters. When
    you are done with this book, it will be even better if you go through the projects
    yourself again from the beginning and start building your own versions of ML models
    for the individual projects.
