<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Test prompt generation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">: To create effective prompts to test the FMs, you need to determine what risks to assess and design the prompt appropriately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">For example, if you want to detect harmful content in the output of an FM, then the prompt should instruct the FM to perform this specific task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">If you want to detect bias in the output, then you want to design your prompt with different terms and keywords, such as the names of certain ethnic groups, and see how the response will be different. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.4">These test prompts can be used to generate outputs from the FMs.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">Output validation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">: This is mainly about building ML models or rule engines that detect specific risks using the test prompt generated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">For example, you can train a harmful content detection model using a hate speech and offensive language dataset and use the model on output generated from a specifically designed test prompt for harmful content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">If you would like to detect bias in the output, then you can build an ML model to detect whether the FM produces an output that is disproportionally biased against a certain group.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">It is important to know that AI risk detection for FMs is still an ongoing research area, and there are still many unknowns and gaps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">For example, hallucination and lack of interpretability remain a challenge with the adoption of FMs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">Furthermore, you need to balance the need for AI risk detection and the specific use case requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.4">For example, some use cases might require less restrictive guardrails on offensive language due to its actual applications such as movie script generation.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-415"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Other evaluation consideration</span></h3>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">Deploying large FMs can be cost prohibitive due to the substantial infrastructure needed to host them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">As a result, there may be a need to opt for smaller and less resource-intensive models in production to strike a balance between cost and model performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.3">Additionally, certain applications, like those related to fraud detection, demand low inference latency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.4">This requirement further narrows down the pool of models that are suitable for production deployment, as low-latency models are preferred in such scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">In conclusion, model selection can be a highly iterative process based on different considerations and potential changes in requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">It is important, therefore, to consider different models and sizes for different needs based on model performance, running cost, and latency for the different use cases.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Causal language modeling</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">: Causal language modeling is a technique employed in</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1528"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1"> training generative language models like GPT-3, characterized by predicting the next token solely based on the preceding context without access to future tokens. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">This ensures that the model learns meaningful sequential dependencies, promoting coherent and logical text generation during inference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.3">During training, the previous context is limited by a fixed window length, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1529"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">the model must predict tokens sequentially in a forward direction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">This differs from standard bidirectional language modeling, where both the left and right context is seen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">While more challenging, causal modeling enhances generation quality and equips the model to handle open-ended text generation tasks effectively.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Masked language model</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">: Masked language model pre-training is a common technique</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1530"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1"> for training extensive language models such as BERT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">This method involves taking a text dataset intended for training and randomly masking a portion of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1531"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">tokens, usually around 15%, within each training example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">These masked tokens are substituted with a distinct </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">[MASK]</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1"> token. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">The model then processes this altered input and is trained to forecast the original identities of the masked words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.3">This prediction leverages the contextual information from nearby unmasked tokens. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.4">The model’s optimization is guided by a loss function that incentivizes accurate predictions of the originally masked words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.5">Consequently, the model’s parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize this prediction loss, leading to improved language understanding and generation capabilities.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">Next sentence prediction</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">: Next sentence prediction pre-training is a technique</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1532"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1"> used in natural language processing, particularly in the training of language models like BERT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">The objective of this technique is to enhance the model’s understanding of sentence relationships and context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.3">In this approach, the model is trained to predict whether two consecutive sentences in a text corpus are logically connected or not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.4">During training, pairs of sentences are sampled, and the model learns to predict whether the second sentence follows the first one coherently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.5">This task encourages the model to capture semantic relationships between sentences and understand discourse flow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.6">By exposing the model to this binary classification task, it gains the ability to comprehend sentence-level context and relationships, which in turn improves its performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">Diffusion</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">: In this technique, a dataset of images paired with text captions is used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1533"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">model consists of an encoder and decoder, and images are incrementally corrupted with noise during multiple iterations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">At each step, the encoder encodes the noisy image, and the decoder attempts to reverse the noise and recover the original image, facilitating denoising autoencoder training for valuable image representations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.3">The process involves hyperparameters like the number of diffusion steps and noise levels, often trained through numerous denoising cycles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.4">The encoder learns semantic image representations from noise, while the decoder learns to generate clean pixels from these representations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.5">Post pre-training, the decoder enables</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1534"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1"> image generation, and the encoder encodes images into a latent space for manipulation, often guided by text captions for conditional input.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">After FMs are pre-trained with a vast amount of training data, they would display a number of abilities in solving text-based or image-based problems such as fluent text generation or image generation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">Language models, post pre-training, accumulate substantial world knowledge and encode a vast range of information, concepts, and relationships from their pre-training data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">They possess a deep understanding of language, facilitating the analysis of syntax, semantics, and text structure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.3">These models excel in generating meaningful text with strong coherence and logical consistency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.4">Another notable feature of LLMs is their capacity to efficiently tackle diverse tasks using a single model with various conditioning inputs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.5">Additionally, they are adaptable to downstream tasks by transferring their acquired foundational knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">For image-based FMs after pre-training on large image datasets, diffusion models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have exhibited capabilities in many image tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">For example, these models can be used for synthesizing highly realistic, coherent images that match the semantics of the prompts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">You can also use these models to provide fine-grained control over image attributes and composition, and creatively recombine different concepts into novel images. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.4">Other image-related capabilities such as inpainting (replacing or restoring missing sections of an image), outpainting (expanding and filling missing parts of an image), and style transfer (tuning the style of images by manipulating the text inputs) also become available after pre-training.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Pre-training an FM demands complex engineering effort as well as significant compute resources and the availability of a large amount of training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">Training these models can take weeks or months with modern compute and data infrastructures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">The following diagram shows the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1535"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1"> high-level flow of model pre-training for LLMs.</span></p>
