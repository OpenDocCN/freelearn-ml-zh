    for data exploration with Amazon book reviews, *Chapter 12* delves deeper into
    the realm of supervised learning, with a focus on classification. Here, we continue
    to leverage ChatGPT, applying its capabilities to enhance our understanding and
    application of supervised learning techniques in the context of customer reviews.

- en: In the realm of e-commerce, customer feedback plays a pivotal role in shaping
    business strategies and product enhancements. As Bill Gates aptly stated, “Your
    most dissatisfied customers are your greatest source of learning.” Customer sentiments
    are often buried within the extensive pool of product reviews. However, manually
    scrutinizing this ocean of reviews, which includes various attributes such as
    product ID, title, text, rating, and helpful votes, is an arduous and often unmanageable
    task.

    making it more accessible and less intimidating, especially when dealing with
    intricate topics such as classification in supervised learning. We will explore
    how ChatGPT can break down complex concepts into more digestible parts, provide
    explanations, and even generate code snippets, thereby reducing the learning curve

    to the initial TF-IDF model, demonstrating higher precision though recall remains
    low. This indicates that while the model can identify negative reviews more accurately
    than before, it still misses many negative cases.
