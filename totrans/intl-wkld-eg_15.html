				<li>A cyber-physical solution is any interoperation between the analog and digital worlds. An edge solution may include cyber-physical interfaces and also interoperates with other entities in a network topology at a point furthest away from the topology's center of gravity.</li>
				<li>Automobiles that are now edge solutions have built-in wireless communications for exchanging messages with a remote service for purposes of logging runtime operations and receiving software updates. For example, Tesla Inc. electric vehicles were designed from day one to be intelligent edge solutions in addition to mechanical vehicles.</li>
				<li>No, the telephone was originally a mechanical device. Despite translating analog audio to electrical impulses, this data was not initially processed with computers. Our <a href="B17595_01_Final_SS_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Introduction to the Data-Driven Edge with Machine Learning,</em> definition of cyber-physical states that hardware and software are combined to deliver outcomes. </li>
				<li>Edge solutions have at least one sensor or actuator for interacting with the analog world, some amount of compute power for processing data or instructions, and interact with at least one other kind of entity at a point in time.</li>
				<li>The three primary types of tools needed to deliver intelligence workloads at the edge are a runtime for orchestrating edge software, a ML model and library, and a method for communicating with other entities. </li>
				<li>The four key benefits in running machine learning models at the edge are improved latency to process data, improved availability through local autonomy, cost savings from reduced data transmitted to a remote service, and more support for complying with data governance requirements.</li>
				<li>The primary persona in smart home solutions is the end consumer (homeowner, resident, or otherwise beneficiary of the solution's capabilities).</li>
				<li>Another potential use case for ML-powered edge solutions in the home is assisted living. People who require additional vital sign monitoring can benefit from the low latency and data governance of local ML.</li>
				<li>The primary personae of industrial solutions are the operators and maintainers of industrial equipment.</li>
				<li>Another use case for industrial solutions is optimizing the use of equipment in order to minimize wear and tear, or maximize the output of the equipment. Industrial equipment often needs to run autonomously, meaning an edge ML solution can operate independently of any remote service that could be unavailable when a decision needs to be made.</li>
				<li>No, typically the IoT architect is responsible for coordinating how ML models are deployed and operated at the edge but is not responsible for their overall accuracy. The IoT architect works with data scientists and product owners to help coordinate overall solution effectiveness, which is bound with the success of properly trained and tested ML models.</li>

				<li value="1">The use of isolated services is the best practice for organizing code in edge ML solutions. Monolithic applications may sometimes be the right choice, depending on project requirements.</li>
				<li>A benefit of decoupling services in edge architecture is limiting the behavioral scope of what those services do. A simple single-purpose service is easier to write, maintain, and reuse.</li>
				<li>A benefit of isolating your code and dependencies from other services is the assurance that you won't have any dependency conflicts between your services.</li>
				<li>A key trade-off when evaluating wired and wireless networking is power consumption. Wireless communication needs more power to transmit and receive messages. If the overall solution is wireless, this usually means reliance upon a local battery source for power.</li>
				<li>A smart home device that uses both a sensor and an actuator is a motorized garage door. These devices use a break beam sensor to detect whether anything is in the path of the door as it is closed by the motor actuator.</li>
				<li>The two kinds of resources defining an IoT Greengrass component are the recipe and the artifacts.</li>
				<li>False – a component does not require an artifact. All of the logic of the component could be contained in the recipe life cycle scripts.</li>
				<li>IoT Greengrass defaults to using the root system user for storing and executing components so that other system users cannot interact with your component files. This helps ensure that your code is running untampered on the device.</li>
				<li>True – components can be deployed to IoT Greengrass devices locally or through remote deployments. Local deployment is more typical in the prototyping phase of a project.</li>
				<li>Here are three different methods to update the <strong class="source-inline">Hello, world</strong> component: start a new deployment and merge in the new component configuration overriding the message key, update the default configuration in the recipe and redeploy, and update the script artifact to use a new string and redeploy.</li>

				<li value="1">The three network topologies common in edge solutions are star, bus, and tree. Hybrid topologies mix and match these topologies in localized areas of the graph. Our hub device uses a hybrid topology in order to communicate with the cloud but otherwise uses a star topology at the edge to connect local devices.</li>
				<li>False – IoT Greengrass does not operate at layer one of the OSI model, though some custom components may interact with it. </li>
				<li>A benefit of using a publish/subscribe model for exchanging messages is decoupling cross-awareness of other devices or components in the solution in your solution code. Abstracting away interactivity to topic addresses shifts interactivity away from a device-specific addressing scheme.</li>
				<li>True – IoT Greengrass can act as both a messaging client (to the cloud) and a messaging broker (to local devices and components).</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">{"temperature": 70}</strong> message is an example of structured data and is serializable.</li>
				<li>Image data from a camera is an example of unstructured data. It is not serializable and would be transmitted as binary data.</li>
				<li>The worst-case scenario of a compromised home network router is a man-in-the-middle attack where your personal data could be exfiltrated or tampered with. Because the traffic appears to be processed as normal, this could mean the attack remains undetected.</li>
				<li>A mitigation strategy for verifying authenticity between two network devices is a public key infrastructure.</li>
				<li>It is important to protect root access on a gateway device so that protected resources and code are not tampered with.</li>
				<li>A downside to using containers for every component in an edge solution is an increase in the overall disk and memory space. It may not meet your device requirements to use containers in every scenario.</li>
				<li>IoT Greengrass provides a built-in service called <strong class="bold">Interprocess Communication</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPC</strong>) to let components exchange messages.</li>
				<li>One way to make the sensor and actuator solution more secure is to restrict the allowed IPC topics to just the specific topics needed for the solution instead of using wildcards.</li>
				<li>To redesign this solution with a third component that will interpret sensor results, this new component would subscribe to the sensor's publishing topic and publish commands to a new topic. The actuator component would then need to be updated to subscribe to this new topic instead.</li>

				<li value="1">Static resources are those that don't change across deployments to multiple devices and don't change after deployment. For example, code artifacts are a static resource that should not be altered after deployment or altered per device in a single deployment. Dynamic resources are fetched at deployment, install, or runtime, and may be different each time they are fetched or locally altered after fetching. For example, the customer-specific configuration for a smart home device is a dynamic resource that would be fetched and vary from device to device.</li>
				<li>IoT Greengrass component artifacts are stored in <strong class="bold">Amazon Simple Storage Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">Amazon S3</strong>) for reference in recipe files.</li>
				<li>You cannot modify an artifact stored in the cloud after it has been registered in a component. This would break the computed digest and flag to IoT Greengrass that the artifact is not safe to use.</li>
				<li>You can't write over artifact files after deployment since these are considered static resources. There is an expectation that these artifacts remain unchanged since a new deployment would replace any alterations. Deployment of artifacts should be idempotent.</li>
				<li>True – devices can belong to multiple thing groups and each thing group can define one active deployment.</li>
				<li>A use case for a device to receive deployments from multiple thing groups is to apply common components across all devices (such as logging or health analysis) and specific components to subsets of devices.</li>
				<li>True – a single component can both reset configuration and merge in a new configuration.</li>
				<li>The Moquette component deploys a local MQTT broker for connecting leaf devices.</li>
				<li>The device shadows component synchronizes the state between the edge and the cloud.</li>
				<li>The MQTT bridge component relays messages between communication channels such as MQTT, IPC, and the cloud.</li>
				<li>The IoT sensor publishes messages to an MQTT topic. The MQTT bridge relays this to an IPC topic. The ML inference component subscribes to the IPC topic and analyzes data for alarm states. The ML inference component publishes new alarm messages to an IPC topic. A component that has access to the audio out channel of the device subscribes to alarm messages and plays sounds based on the alarm received.</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Chapter 5 </h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">False – data modeling is applicable for all kinds of databases.</li>
				<li>The benefit of performing a data modeling exercise is to select appropriate storage solutions such as a database and a schema.</li>
				<li>The relevance of ETL architectures for edge solutions is that we can define multiple data processing paths based on the data's velocity (Lambda architecture). For example, an edge solution can inspect individual sensor measurements to detect alarming peaks while forwarding measurements in bulk to the cloud for cheaper storage.</li>
				<li>False – Lambda architecture is a pattern distinct from the Amazon Web Services offering of the same name.</li>
				<li>One benefit for data processing at the edge is to perform data cleansing and filtering steps on noisy analog data close to the source before incurring costs of transmitting and storing data on the cloud, where the data may not be used at all.</li>
				<li>The minimum component of Greengrass needed to run is the nucleus.</li>
				<li>False – managing streams for real-time processing applies to the edge and the cloud.</li>
				<li>To persist data at the edge for a longer duration of time, configure a data pond solution with the cheapest kind of storage available, such as a local disk.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Chapter 6 </h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Two benefits of domain-driven design for edge workloads are as follows:<ul><li>Maintaining a high bar of data quality as data moves throughout a multi-layered system</li><li>Minimizing developer overhead by making it easier for teams delivering solutions to understand and be fluent in the contexts they are working in</li></ul></li>
				<li>False – bounded context and ubiquitous language are distinct concepts within domain-driven design.</li>
				<li>The benefit of having an operational data store versus a data lake or data warehouse is that specific events and transactions can be indexed and queried in an operational data store. If all transactional data is stored in a data lake as raw input, there must be some additional layer to map this input to the events it represents.</li>
				<li>A Lambda design pattern brings together streaming and a batch workflow.</li>
				<li>The data lake strategy can be used to transform raw data in the cloud.</li>
				<li>False – managed services wrapping a NoSQL database provide APIs to read and write data.</li>
				<li>The mediator topology is used for scenarios where a chain of steps is guided by a central coordinator. The broker topology is used for scenarios where data producers and consumers can more freely exchange data and react to events.</li>
				<li>One benefit of using serverless functions for processing IoT data is that only compute resources are consumed when there is IoT data to process. Another benefit is scaling up compute resources to meet the scale of surges of IoT data.</li>
				<li>Making data available to end consumers can be done with <strong class="bold">Business Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">BI</strong>) tools such as Amazon QuickSight, Microsoft Power BI, and Tableau.</li>
				<li>False – JSON is not the most optimized data format for big data processing. Better examples are Apache ORC and Parquet. </li>
				<li>An API interface on top of an operational data store could be a serverless HTTP API that accepts parameters for date ranges, device IDs, and sensors, and then runs an optimized query on the data store to return results. </li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Chapter 7 </h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">False – there are more than two types of ML systems.</li>
				<li>The four types of ML systems are supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. They range in utility based on how much we know about the input data, and whether we are training for a specific result or looking to see what the algorithm can find in the noise.</li>
				<li>False – K-means is a clustering algorithm.</li>
				<li>The three phases of the ML project lifecycle are data collection, data preparation, and modeling.</li>
				<li>Two frameworks for training ML models are TensorFlow and MXNet.</li>
				<li>AWS IoT Greengrass is the tool to deploy trained models from the cloud to the edge.</li>
				<li>False – Greengrass offers managed components ready for image classification.</li>
				<li>One anti-pattern for ML and IoT workloads is setting an expectation that a single person has the expertise for data preparation, ML training, and deploying solutions to the edge.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Chapter 8 </h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">A strategy for developing IoT workloads with more agility is to use DevOps methodology.</li>
				<li>False – DevOps is a methodology first from which new tools are designed to support the benefits of faster software delivery with higher quality. </li>
				<li>Two challenges for DevOps in IoT workloads are as follows:<ul><li>The edge devices are in remote locations, often outside of our direct control.</li><li>We cannot throw away edge environments broken by a bad change and start over as we can with a virtual machine in the cloud.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Tools such as AWS IoT Greengrass, CloudFormation, and Terraform are used to design DevOps workflows between the edge and the cloud.</li>
				<li>True – running code at the edge in containers and in AWS Lambda functions offers similar benefits (though each has distinctly unique benefits, too).</li>
				<li>Three benefits of using MLOps with IoT workloads are productivity (faster iterations on training and deployment), reliability (using CI/CD practices improves the quality of deployments), and auditability (enabling end-to-end visibility of input and output).</li>
				<li>The different phases of an MLOps workflow are design, model development, and operations.</li>
				<li>True – the ecosystem of MLOps and related toolchains are newer and not as mature as those in the DevOps ecosystem.</li>
				<li>AWS provides a SageMaker Edge Manager service for performing MLOps at the edge.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Chapter 9 </h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">False – device registration is the process of assigning an identity while device activation is when it comes online for the first time.</li>
				<li>A certificate authority can be used with Greengrass to provision certificates for fleets of devices. I can bring my own certificate authority, use one from AWS, or use one from a third-party vendor.</li>
				<li>Devices can be provisioned in real time with <em class="italic">just-in-time</em> processes such as fleet provisioning and just-in-time provisioning using AWS IoT Core.</li>
				<li>False – in addition to metrics and logs, there are further monitoring techniques, such as a heartbeat.</li>
				<li>A benefit of using a dashboard to view an entire fleet of devices is to identify outliers and take action on them in a single place, speeding up the time taken for recognition and resolution.</li>
				<li>A mitigation strategy for remote troubleshooting is to set up reverse tunneling sessions so that operators can interact with devices over the network without compromising on the security of preventing inbound connections.</li>
				<li>AWS IoT Greengrass provides managed components such as LogManager, CloudWatch, and the nucleus telemetry emitter.</li>
				<li>False – aggregation of metrics can be performed on the edge device. It is not required to be done in the cloud.</li>
