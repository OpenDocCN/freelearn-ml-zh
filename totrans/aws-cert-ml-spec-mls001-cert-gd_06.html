			<p>Data visualization is an art! No matter how much effort you and your team put into data preparation and preliminary analysis for modeling, if you don't know how to show your findings effectively, your audience may not understand the point you are trying to make.</p>
			<p>Often, such situations may be even worse when you are dealing with decision-makers. For example, if you choose the wrong set of charts to tell a particular story, people can misinterpret your analysis and make bad decisions.</p>
			<p>Understanding the different types of data visualizations and knowing how they fit with each type of analysis will put you in a very good position, in terms of engaging your audience and transmitting the information you want to.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about some data visualization techniques. We will be covering the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visualizing relationships in your data</li>
				<li>Visualizing comparisons in your data</li>
				<li>Visualizing compositions in your data</li>
				<li>Visualizing distributions in your data</li>
				<li>Building key performance indicators</li>
				<li>Introducing Quick Sight</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We already know why we need to master these topics, so let's get started.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Visualizing relationships in your data</h1>
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>need to show relationships in our data, we are usually talking about plotting two or more variables in a chart to visualize their level of dependency. A <strong class="bold">scatter plot</strong> is probably <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>the most common type of chart to show the relationship between <strong class="bold">two</strong> variables. The following is a scatter plot for two variables, <strong class="bold">x</strong> and <strong class="bold">y</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer076" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_001.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Plotting relationships with a scatter plot&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Plotting relationships with a scatter plot</p>
			<p>The preceding plot shows a clear relationship between <strong class="bold">x</strong> and <strong class="bold">y</strong>. As <strong class="bold">x </strong>increases, <strong class="bold">y</strong> also increases. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>particular case, we can say that there is a linear relationship between both variables. Keep in mind that scatter plots may also catch other types of relationships, not only linear ones. For example, it would also be possible to find an exponential relationship between the two variables.</p>
			<p>Another nice chart to make comparisons with <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>is known as a <strong class="bold">bubble chart</strong>. Just like a scatter plot, it will also show the relationship between variables; however, here, you can use a third dimension, which will be represented by the size of the point. </p>
			<p>The following is a bubble chart that's explaining an investment schema, where <strong class="bold">x</strong> is the annual rate, <strong class="bold">y</strong> is the investment period, and the size of the bubble is the size of each investment option:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_002.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Plotting relationships with a bubble chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – Plotting relationships with a bubble chart</p>
			<p>Looking at the preceding chart, we can see two types of relationships: the longer the investment period, the <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>higher your annual rate, and the higher the amount invested, the higher your annual rate. As we can see, this is a very effective way to present this type of analysis. Next, we'll learn how to compare our data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Visualizing comparisons in your data</h1>
			<p>Comparisons are <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>very common in data analysis and we have different ways to present them. Let's start with the <strong class="bold">bar chart</strong>. I am sure you have seen many reports that have used this type of visualization. </p>
			<p>Bar charts <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>can be used to compare one variable among different classes; for example, a car's price across different models or population size per country. In the following graph,  we have used a bar chart to present the number of Covid-19 cases per state in India, until June 2020:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer078" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_003.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Plotting comparisons with a bar chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – Plotting comparisons with a bar chart</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we can also use <strong class="bold">stacked column charts</strong> to add <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>another dimension to the data that is <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>being analyzed. For example, in the following graph, we are using a stacked bar chart to show how many people were on board the Titanic, per gender. Additionally, we are breaking down the number of people who survived (positive class) and those who did not (negative class):</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer079" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_004.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – Using a stacked bar chart to analyze the Titanic disaster dataset&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – Using a stacked bar chart to analyze the Titanic disaster dataset</p>
			<p>As we can see, most <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>of the women survived the disaster, while most of the men did not. The stacked bars help us visualize the difference between genders. Finally, you should know that we can also show percentages on those stacked bars, instead of absolute numbers. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Column charts</strong> are also <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>useful If you need to compare one or two variables across different periods. For example, in the following graph, we can see the annual Canadian electronic vehicle sales by province:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer080" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_005.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – Plotting comparisons with a column chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – Plotting comparisons with a column chart</p>
			<p>Another very effective <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>way to make comparisons across different periods is by using <strong class="bold">line charts</strong>. In the following chart, we are showing a pretty interesting <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>example of how we can compare different algorithms' performance, in a particular project, across different release dates.  </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Line charts are usually very helpful to show if there is any trend in the data over the period of time under analysis. A very common use case for line charts is <strong class="bold">forecasting</strong>, where <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>we usually have to analyze trends and seasonality in time series data.</p>
			<p>For example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>can see that the <strong class="bold">Classification</strong> <strong class="bold">and</strong> <strong class="bold">Regression</strong> <strong class="bold">Trees</strong> (<strong class="bold">CART</strong>) model used <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>to be the poorest <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>performant model <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>compared to other <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>algorithms, such as <strong class="bold">AdaBoost</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADA</strong>), <strong class="bold">Gradient Boosting</strong> (<strong class="bold">GB</strong>), <strong class="bold">Random Forest</strong> (<strong class="bold">RF</strong>), and <strong class="bold">logistic regression </strong>(<strong class="bold">LOGIT</strong>). </p>
			<p>However, in July, the CART model was changed, and it turned out to be the third-best model across all other models. This whole story about the best model for each period can easily be seen in the following chart:   </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer081" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_006.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Plotting comparisons with a line chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – Plotting comparisons with a line chart</p>
			<p>Finally, you can also <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>show comparisons of your data using <strong class="bold">tables</strong>. Tables are <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>more useful when we have multiple dimensions (usually placed in the rows of the table) and one or multiple metrics to make comparisons against (usually placed in the columns of the table).</p>
			<p>In the next section, we w<a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>ill learn about another set of charts that aims to show the distribution of your variables. This set of charts is particularly important for modeling tasks since you must know the distribution of a feature to think about potential data transformations for it. Let's take a look at this!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Visualizing distributions in your data</h1>
			<p>Exploring the <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>distribution of your feature is very important to understand some key characteristics of it, such as its skewness, mean, median, and quantiles. You can easily visualize skewness by plotting a <strong class="bold">histogram</strong>. This type of chart groups your data into <strong class="bold">bins</strong> or <strong class="bold">buckets</strong> and performs counts on top of them. For example, the following chart shows a histogram for the <em class="italic">age</em> variable:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer082" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_007.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – Plotting distributions with a histogram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – Plotting distributions with a histogram</p>
			<p>Looking at the <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>histogram, we can conclude that most of the people are between 20 and 50 years old. We can also see a few people more than 60 years old. Another example of a histogram is shown in the following chart, where we are plotting the distribution of payments from a particular event that has different ticket prices. We want to see how much money people are paying per ticket:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer083" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_008.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – Checking skewness with a histogram&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Checking skewness with a histogram</p>
			<p>Here, we can see <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>that the majority of the people are paying a maximum of 100 dollars per ticket. That's the reason why we can see a skewed distribution to the right-hand side (the tail side).  </p>
			<p>If you want to see other characteristics of the distribution, such as its median, quantiles, and outliers, then you <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>should use <strong class="bold">box plots</strong>. In the following chart, we are again comparing the performance of different algorithms in a given dataset. </p>
			<p>These algorithms were executed many times, in a cross-validation process, which resulted in multiple outputs for the same algorithm; for example, one accuracy metric for each execution of the algorithm on each fold.</p>
			<p>Since we have multiple accuracy metrics for each algorithm, we can use a box plot to check how each of those algorithms performed during the cross-validation process:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer084" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_009.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – Plotting distributions with a box plot&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – Plotting distributions with a box plot</p>
			<p>Here, we can see <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>that box plots can present some information about the distribution of the data, such as its median, lower quartile, upper quartile, and outliers. For a complete understanding of each element of a box plot, take a look at the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer085" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_010.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – Box plot elements&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – Box plot elements</p>
			<p>By analyzing the box plot shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.9</em>, we can conclude that the ADA algorithm has presented some outliers during the cross-validation process since one of the executions resulted in a very good model (around 92% accuracy). All the other executions of AdaBoost resulted in less than 85% accuracy, with a median value of around 80%. </p>
			<p>Another conclusion we can make after analyzing <em class="italic">Figure 4.9</em> is that the CART algorithm presented the poorest performance during the cross-validation process (the lowest median and lower quartile). </p>
			<p>Before we wrap up <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>this section, note that you can also use a scatter plot to analyze data distributions when you have more than one variable. Now, let's look at another set of charts that is useful for showing compositions in your data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Visualizing compositions in your data</h1>
			<p>Sometimes, you <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>want to analyze the various elements that compose your feature; for example, the percentage of sales per region or percentage of queries per channel. In both examples, we are not considering any time dimension; instead, we are just looking at the data as a whole. For these types of compositions, where you don't have the time dimension, you could show your data using <strong class="bold">pie charts</strong>, <strong class="bold">stacked 100% bar charts</strong>, and <strong class="bold">treemaps</strong>.</p>
			<p>The following is a pie chart showing the number of queries per customer channel, for a given company, during a pre-defined period of time:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer086" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_011.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11 – Plotting compositions with a pie chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – Plotting compositions with a pie chart</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>want to show compositions while considering a time dimension, then your most common options would be a <strong class="bold">stacked area chart</strong>, a <strong class="bold">stacked 100% area chart</strong>, a <strong class="bold">stacked column chart</strong>, or a <strong class="bold">stacked 100% column chart</strong>. For reference, take a look at the following chart, which shows the sales per region from 2016 until 2020:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer087" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16735_04_012.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12 – Plotting compositions with a stacked 100% column chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – Plotting compositions with a stacked 100% column chart</p>
			<p>As we can see, stacked 100% <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>column charts help us understand compositions across different periods. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Building key performance indicators</h1>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>we wrap up these data visualization sections, I want to introduce <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong>, or <strong class="bold">KPIs</strong> for short.</p>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>KPI is usually a single value that describes the results of a business indicator, such as the churn rate, <strong class="bold">net promoter score</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPS</strong>), <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>), and so <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>on. Although there are some commonly used indicators across different industries, you are free to come up with a number, based on your company's needs. </p>
			<p>To be honest, the most complex challenge associated with indicators is not in their visualization aspect itself, but in the way they have been built (the rules used) and the way they will be communicated and used across different levels of the company. </p>
			<p>From a visualization perspective, just like any other single value, you can use all those charts that we have learned about to analyze your indicator, depending on your need. However, if you just want to show your KPI, with no time dimension, you can use a <strong class="bold">widget</strong>.</p>
			<p>Alright, that's all I have to talk about regarding data visualization techniques for the AWS machine learning specialty <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>exam. Now, let's take a look at Quick Sight, an AWS service where you can implement all these visualization techniques you have just learned.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Introducing Quick Sight</h1>
			<p>Amazon Quick Sight is a <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>cloud-based analytics service that allows you to build data visualizations and ad hoc analysis. Quick Sight supports a variety of data sources, such as Redshift, Aurora, Athena, RDS, and your on-premises database solution. </p>
			<p>Other sources of data include S3, where you can retrieve <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>data from Excel, CSV, or log files, and <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) solutions, where you can retrieve data from Salesforce entities. </p>
			<p>Amazon Quick Sight has two versions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Standard Edition</li>
				<li>Enterprise Edition</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The most important difference between these two versions is the possibility of integration <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>with Microsoft <strong class="bold">Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">AD</strong>) and encryption at rest. Both features are only provided in the enterprise edition. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Keep in mind that AWS services are constantly evolving, so more differences between the standard and enterprise versions may crop up in the future. You should always consult the latest documentation of AWS services to check what's new.</p>
			<p>In terms of access management, Quick Sight offers a very simple interface you can use to control user access. In the standard edition, you have pretty much two options for inviting a user to your Quick Sight account: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can invite an IAM user.</li>
				<li>You can send an invitation to an email address.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you invite an IAM user, then they can automatically log into your account and see or edit your visualization, depending on the type of permission you have provided during Quick Sight user creation. If you have invited an email address, then the email owner has to access his/her mailbox to complete this operation.</p>
			<p>Removing a user is also pretty straightforward. The only extra information you have to provide while removing a user is whether you want to transfer the orphaned resources to another user into your account, <em class="italic">or</em> whether you want to delete all the user's resources.</p>
			<p>If you are playing with the <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>enterprise edition, this process of authorizing users can be a little different since you have AD working for you. In this case, you can grant access to AD groups, and all the users from that group would be granted access to your account on Quick Sight.</p>
			<p>Also, remember that in both versions, all data transfer is encrypted; however, you will only find encryption at rest in the enterprise edition.</p>
			<p>When you are bringing data into Quick Sight, you are technically creating what <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>we call <strong class="bold">datasets</strong>. Datasets, in turn, are imported in an optimized structure <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>into Quick Sight, known as the <strong class="bold">Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory, Calculation Engine</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPICE</strong>). That's why Quick Sight can perform data visualization on big data.</p>
			<p>We know that Quick Sight offers high availability and durability since the data that's imported into it is replicated.</p>
			<p>Something else you should be aware of is that Quick Sight does not only allow you to plot your data but also perform some small data preparation tasks, such as renaming fields, computing new fields, changing data types, preparing queries to retrieve data from the source, and joining tables from the same source. </p>
			<p>Let's summarize the main steps for working with Quick Sight:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>User creation and authorization.</li>
				<li>Connecting to a <strong class="bold">data source</strong>.</li>
				<li>Bringing data into a <strong class="bold">dataset</strong>.</li>
				<li>Your dataset will be imported into <strong class="bold">SPICE</strong>.</li>
				<li>From a dataset, you can create an <strong class="bold">analysis</strong>.</li>
				<li>Finally, inside your analysis, you can add <strong class="bold">visuals</strong>.</li>
				<li>In case you want to go further, you can create a snapshot of your analysis and place it in a <strong class="bold">dashboard</strong>. Alternatively, you can group your analysis into <strong class="bold">stories</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That brings us to the end of <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>this chapter about data visualizations! Now, let's take a look at what we have learned.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>We have reached the end of this chapter about data visualization. Let's take this opportunity to provide a quick recap of what we have learned. We started this chapter by showing you how to visualize relationships in your data. Scatter plots and bubble charts are the most important charts in this category, either to show relationships between two or three variables, respectively. </p>
			<p>Then, we moved on to another category of data visualization, which aimed to make comparisons in your data. The most common charts that you can use to show comparisons are bar charts, column charts, and line charts. Tables are also useful to show comparisons.</p>
			<p>The next use case that we covered was visualizing data distributions. The most common types of charts that are used to show distributions are histograms and box plots. </p>
			<p>Then, we moved on to compositions. We use this set of charts when we want to show the different elements that make up the data. While showing compositions, you must be aware of whether you want to present static data or data that changes over time. For static data, you should use a pie chart, a stacked 100% bar chart, or a treemap. For data that changes over time, you should use a stacked area chart, a stacked 100% area chat, a stacked column chart, or a stacked 100% column chart.</p>
			<p>The last section of this chapter was reserved for Quick Sight, which is an AWS service that you can use to visualize your data. You learned about the different versions and features of the service, and you were then introduced to SPICE.</p>
			<p>Well done! In the next chapter, you will learn about AWS's data storing services, such as S3, EBS, EFS, and many others. That is going to be a very important chapter for your certification journey, so make sure you're prepared! However, before we jump into that new chapter, let's practice a little more for the exam!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Questions</h1>

Histograms are also nice for performing error analysis.</p></li>
				<li>Although you believe that two particular variables are highly correlated, you think this is not a linear correlation. Knowing the type of correlation between these two variables is crucial for determining the type of algorithm that you are going to use in later phases of this project. Which type of chart could you use to show the correlations between these two variables?<p>a) Line chart</p><p>b) Bubble chart</p><p>c) Histogram</p><p>d) Scatter plot</p><p class="callout-heading">Answer</p><p class="callout">D, Correlation is a type of relationship. In this case, we just have two variables, so a scatter plot would be a good approach to this problem.</p></li>
				<li>You are working for a call center company, and the business team wants to see the percentage of calls on each channel of their <strong class="bold">interactive voice response device</strong>. You just got those percentages, broken down per month.

Both a and b could be used to show compositions; however, only option b would be appropriate to show those compositions across each month.</p></li>
				<li>You are working as a data scientist for a telecom company. The company offers many different services related to broadband, TV, phone, and mobile. In total, the company offers more than 50 services. You want to see the number of services that each customer usually signs for. What's the most appropriate chart to use to prepare for this visualization? <p>a) Pie chart</p><p>b) Stacked 100% column chart</p><p>c) Histogram</p><p>d) Scatter plot</p><p class="callout-heading">Answer</p><p class="callout">C, Since the company has so many services and you want to see the distribution of the number of services per customer, the most appropriate chart would be a histogram. Keep in mind that, most of the time, when the goal of the analysis is showing distributions, your most common options are histograms and box plots. Depending on the use case, scatter plots can also be used.</p></li>
				<li>You are working on a sales report for your company and you need to make different types of comparisons regarding your company's sales across different regions. Which of the following types of charts are suitable for presenting comparisons in your data (choose all the correct answers)?<p>a) Bar chart</p><p>b) Column chart</p><p>c) Line chart</p><p>d) Histogram</p><p class="callout-heading">Answer</p><p class="callout">A, B, C, You have multiple options when it comes to using charts to present comparisons on your data. Use bar charts when you have a single variable and no time dimension; use column charts when you have one or two variables changing over time; and use line charts when you have three or more variables changing over time. Finally, remember that it is also possible to show comparisons using tables. This is especially helpful when you have three or more variables.</p></li>
				<li>You are working as a data scientist for a meteorological organization. Your company is measuring the daily temperature of a particular region during the entire summer. The summer is over and it is now time to present a detailed report about the data that has been captured. Which of the following options are not valid types of analysis (choose all correct answers)?<p>a) Create a box plot to show some statistics about the data; for example, the median temperature, lower and upper quartiles, and outlier points.</p><p>b) Create a histogram to show the distribution of the data across all the different days when temperatures have been measured. </p><p>c) Create a key performance indicator just to present the average temperature that has been measured during the summer, in that particular region.</p><p>d) Create a line chart to show the evolution of the temperature, day after day. That will give you some sense about the increasing and decreasing trends.</p><p class="callout-heading">Answer</p><p class="callout">All the answers are valid types of analysis for this particular problem. Box plots and histograms would be very useful to present the distribution of the data; a KPI would provide a straight answer to the question "What was the average temperature?"; and line charts could be used to show the trends in the data during the period of measurement. There are many other types of analysis you could use for this problem. Just as another example, you could think of using a column chart to show the average temperature every month. </p></li>
				<li>You are working in a financial company and your team is responsible for the investment portfolio. You have multiple options for investments and the key characteristics of all of them are annual rate, investment period, and investment amount. There is a straight relationship between these three components. You have built a bubble chart to show the relationship among these investment options, but now, you want to compare them and add a few more dimensions, such as level of risk and year after year performance. What is the most appropriate way to present this information in the most compact way?<p>a) Change the current bubble chart that you created previously, by adding these new dimensions.</p><p>b) Create a table to present this information, where each investment option is represented by rows and each metric is represented by columns.</p><p>c) Keep the current bubble chart as-is and create a few more visualizations to present the new metrics.</p><p>d) Keep the current bubble chart as-is and present the rest of the information in a tabular structure.</p><p class="callout-heading">Answer</p><p class="callout">B, You should be aware that, during your exam, you might find questions with multiple correct answers; however, there will be an optimal one. In this case, only one option would be wrong, but all the rest are quite possible. Option b is the most accurate answer since the question is asking about the "most compact way" the present the information. Pay attention to specific keywords in the questions during your exam.</p></li>
				<li>You are working as a data scientist for a marketing company. At the moment, you are building a machine learning model to predict churn. One of the features that you are using on your model is <em class="italic">annual salary</em>. Due to the nature of this variable, you suspect that a log transformation would be beneficial to bring this feature closer to a normal distribution. Which of the following charts would support you to prove that, indeed, a log transformation is a good idea for this feature?<p>a) Histogram</p><p>b) Scatter plot</p><p>c) Line chart</p><p>d) Stacked bar chart</p><p class="callout-heading">Answer</p><p class="callout">A, Deciding on whether log transformation is a good idea or not will depend on the distribution of the data. If you have a skewed distribution, then log transformation could be beneficial to bringing this data closer to a normal distribution. Depending on the algorithm you are using for modeling, such a transformation can improve the accuracy of your model. The histogram is the right answer to this question since it will present the data distribution that will support your decision.</p></li>
