			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>The AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification exam tests your competency to perform <strong class="bold">machine</strong> <strong class="bold">learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) on AWS infrastructure. This book covers the entire exam syllabus in depth using practical examples to help you with your real-world machine learning projects on AWS.</p>
			<p>Starting with an introduction to machine learning on AWS, you'll learn the fundamentals of machine learning and explore important AWS services for <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>). You'll then see how to prepare data for machine learning and discover different techniques for data manipulation and transformation for different types of variables. The book also covers the handling of missing data and outliers and takes you through various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, anomaly detection, text mining, and image processing, along with their specific ML algorithms, that you should know to pass the exam. Finally, you'll explore model evaluation, optimization, and deployment and get to grips with deploying models in a production environment and monitoring them.</p>
			<p>By the end of the book, you'll have gained knowledge of all the key fields of machine learning and the solutions that AWS has released for each of them, along with the tools, methods, and techniques commonly used in each domain of AWS machine learning.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for professionals and students who want to take and pass the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam or gain a deeper knowledge of machine learning with a special focus on AWS. Familiarity with the basics of machine learning and AWS services is necessary.</p>

You will also learn how to handle missing values and outliers on your data, two important topics to build good machine learning models.</p>
			<p><a href="B16735_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding and Visualizing Data</em>, teaches you how to select the most appropriate data visualization technique according to different variable types and business needs. You will also learn about available AWS services for visualizing data.</p>
			<p><a href="B16735_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">AWS Services for Data Storing</em>, teaches you about AWS services used to store data for machine learning. You will learn about the many different S3 storage classes and when to use each of them. You will also learn how to handle data encryption and how to secure your data at rest and in transit. Finally, we will present other types of data store services, still worth knowing for the exam.</p>
			<p><a href="B16735_06_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">AWS Services for Processing</em>, teaches you about AWS services used to process data for machine learning. You will learn how to deal with batch and real-time processing, how to directly query data on Amazon S3, and how to create big data applications on EMR.</p>
			<p><a href="B16735_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor136"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Applying Machine Learning Algorithms</em>, covers different types of machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, anomaly detection, text mining, and image processing. Each of these tasks has specific algorithms that you should know about to pass the exam. You will also learn how ensemble models work and how to deal with the curse of dimensionality.</p>
			<p><a href="B16735_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Evaluating and Optimizing Models</em>, teaches you how to select model metrics to evaluate model results. You will also learn how to optimize your model by tuning its hyperparameters.</p>
			<p><a href="B16735_09_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Amazon SageMaker Modeling</em>, teaches you how to spin up notebooks to work with exploratory data analysis and how to train your models on Amazon SageMaker. You will learn where and how your training data should be stored in order to be accessible through SageMaker and the different data formats that you can use.</p>
