- en: We are living on the verge of a new era of computing, an era where computers
    are becoming more of a companion than a tool. The devices we carry in our pockets
    will soon better understand our world and us a lot better, and this will have
    a profound impact on how we interact with and use them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But right now, a lot of these exciting advancements are stuck in the labs of
    researchers and not in the hands of designers and developers, making them usable
    and accessible to users. This is not because the details are locked away; on the
    contrary, in most cases they are freely available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This gap is somewhat due to our contentment with sticking to what we know, having
    the user do all the work, making them tap on the buttons. If nothing else, I hope
    this book makes you curious about what is out there and how it can be used to
    create new experiences, or improve existing ones.

    build an understanding of how deep neural networks work and how they can be applied.

- en: This book focuses on a set of models for a better understanding of images and
    photos, specifically looking at how they can be adapted and applied on the iOS
    platform. This narrow focus of image-based models and the iOS platform is intentional;
    I find that the visual nature of images makes the concepts easier to, well, visualize,
    and the iPhone provides the perfect candidate and environment for experimentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, as you go through this book, I encourage you to start thinking about new
    ways of how these models can be used and what new experiences you could create.
    With that being said, let's get started!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will appeal to three broad groups of people. The first are intermediate
    iOS developers who are interested in learning and applying **machine learning**
    (**ML**); some exposure to ML concepts may be beneficial but are not essential
    as this book covers the intuition behind the concepts and models used throughout
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second group are those who have experience in ML but not in iOS development
    and are looking for a resource to help them to get the grips with Core ML; for
    this group, it is recommended to complement this book with a book that covers
    the fundamentals of iOS development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last group are experienced iOS developers and ML practitioners who are curious
    to see how various models have been applied in the context of the iOS platform.

    Learning*, provides a brief introduction to ML, including some explanation of
    the core concepts, the types of problems, algorithms, and general workflow of
    creating and using a ML models. The chapter concludes by exploring some examples
    where ML is being applied.'

    workflow for using it.'

    in the World*, walks through building a Core ML application from start to finish.
    By the end of the chapter, we would have been through the whole process of obtaining
    a model, importing it into the project, and making use of it.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](a89287b3-5c90-4f77-801f-371f7a8f2d36.xhtml), *Emotion Detection
    with CNNs*, explores the possibilities of computers understanding us better, specifically
    our mood. We start by building our intuition of how ML can learn to infer your
    mood, and then put this to practice by building an application that does just
    that. We also use this as an opportunity to introduce the Vision framework and
    see how it complements Core ML.'

    in the World*, goes beyond recognizing a single object to being able to recognize
    and locate multiple objects within a single image through object detection. After
    building our understanding of how it works, we move on to applying it to a visual
    search application that filters not only by object but also by composition of
    objects. In this chapter, we''ll also get an opportunity to extend Core ML by
    implementing customer layers.'

    Style Transfer*, uncovers the secrets behind the popular photo effects application,
    Prisma. We start by discussing how a model can be taught to differentiate between
    the style and content of an image, and then go on to build a version of  Prisma
    that applies a style from one image to another. We wrap up this chapter by looking
    at ways to optimize the model.'

    using the same concepts that have been introduced in previous chapters. Once what
    the user is trying to sketch has been recognized, we look at how we can find similar
    substitutes using the feature vectors from a CNN.'

    neural network** (**CNN**) with a **recurrent neural network** (**RNN**) for sketch
    classification, thus introducing RNNs and showing how they can be applied to images.
    Along with a discussion on learning sequences, we will also delve into the details
    of how to download and compile Core ML models remotely.'
