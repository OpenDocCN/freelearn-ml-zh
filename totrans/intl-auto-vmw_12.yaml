    cloud automation creates and implements a life cycle approach for managing and
    delivering SDDC-based services to help customers transition into a service provider
    organization. This service focuses on optimizing organizational and process capabilities
    to support the **Software-Defined Data Center** (**SDDC**) concept to realize
    the full capabilities of these technologies that are delivered in a modular format
    and to deliver real business benefits through the integration of the technology,
    people, and processes.

    to manage separate solutions for app delivery. VMware is taking a different approach
    to managing applications. We have methods where we can provision one app to many
    desktops, thereby saving considerable time and storage costs. We can deliver apps
    in seconds and at scale. We can isolate apps to remove the app conflict barrier.
    Apps can then be consumed on any device and on one portal. We can even transform

    the on-premise private cloud infrastructure services in relation to their customer's
    different functional groups to determine the current trend, future demand, and

    the customers for the consumed resources. The customer's stakeholders want a precise
    view of the costs that are required to provide a unit of IaaS resource, gain better
    visibility into the loaded costs of components it is comprised of, and provide
    **total cost of ownership** (**TCO**) to run the IaaS. The customer gets the total
    capital expenses and operating expenses for running the IaaS infrastructure, so
    they want to allocate these costs to the underlying resources that constitute
    the services. These resources are CPU, RAM, storage, operating systems, license,
    and labor. The customer's operation team for private cloud operations, cloud administrators,
    and designated business owners must make cost-based analyses and decisions by
    achieving an in-depth understanding of how the cloud infrastructure is being provisioned
    to business units, and what the allocated and unallocated costs of provisioned
    resources, such as CPU, RAM, and storage are. They want to analyze the allocated
    and unallocated costs of infrastructure by resource type. Cloud administrators
    also want to determine whether there is hardware available to run VMs on the existing
    infrastructure, create reports on groups of old servers nearing expiry or end-of-support,
    and also create automatic reports to show stakeholders that new infrastructure
    might need to be procured.

    This way, ownership is diffused among different people, creating possible breakdowns
    between service life cycle stages or among different stakeholders, and things
    may fall between different people or create duplicacy. It also creates a tendency
    toward finger-pointing due to a lack of single point of accountability, which
    ultimately leads to reactive management with a lack of explicit commitment to
    evolve the service and promote the cloud more broadly. It will also lack overall
    vision as the same service may be delivered differently across the enterprise,

- en: The physical configuration specifications of the ESXi host list the characteristics
    of the ESXi hosts, and can be used during deployment and testing as per VMware
    best practices. The configuration and assembly process for each system is standardized,
    with all of the components installed in the same manner on each ESXi host. Standardizing
    the entire physical configuration of the ESXi hosts is critical to providing an
    easily manageable and supportable infrastructure because standardization eliminates
    variability. You can deploy ESXi hosts with identical configuration, including
    identical storage, and networking configurations, across all cluster members.
    For example, consistent PCI card slot placement, especially for network controllers,
    is essential for the accurate alignment of physical to virtual I/O resources.
    Identical configurations ensure an even balance of VM storage components across
    storage and compute resources. The following are the recommendations that we've
    mentioned, along with their priorities.

    network through our logical networking constructs. Now, it comes down to replicating
    the same for public cloud with NSX Cloud by providing visibility across all clouds
    for all traffic flows. We can't secure what we can't see. A new VM is created
    by a developer while the IT admin needs to have a dashboard and some kind of a
    UI that will make that visible to them. We have to design a unified consistent
    security policy across on-premise and the public cloud so that we can provide
    advanced L2/L3 networking capabilities, or if we are creating logical topologies
    for our on-premise network, then there can be APIs to port network topology from

    that are being spun off inside a VPC/VNET. The gateway expects the agent in a
    VM to come and register itself, and if it doesn't, the gateway will move the VM
    to a quarantine security group. We can do this by using a default quarantine policy
    setup. Since the agent is not there, NSX **Public Cloud Gateway** (**PCG**) can't
    push any policies there, which doesn't mean that NSX doesn't have control over
    the VM itself. NSX can speak with the cloud provider and move this VM to a quarantine
    state. This is like adding another level of security and if we have an agent running,
    the PCG can push policies and manage the VM. If the agent is absent, PCG can move
    the entire VM to a quarantine state. Since PCG is the one doing this task, we
    don't have to worry about losing connectivity with on-premises systems. PCG has
    **Identity and Access Management** (**IAM**) roles assigned to it, which lets
    it talk to the cloud inventory. This is patented and we don't ask for admin privileges

    users creating VPCs for the workload or to impose security restrictions on them.
    But here, security is more like an afterthought. If we are looking for a consolidation
    of security groups for all VPCs and VNETs, then we need some level of abstraction.
    If we want a security group that can span across env, then we need a tool such
    as NSX. We can create NSX security policies using NSGroups in our NSX-T environment.
    NSGroups can be created with dynamic attributes such an VM name, location of the
    VM, which VNET it is running in, what region it is running in, and so on. It can
    also be based on user-defined custom tags, such as what the application is running

    can get a new, or manage their, application landscape with a self-service portal
    to customize their requirements. After the environment has been provisioned and
    tested, developers will get a link for their application entities with login details
    and a web console that's used to monitor the different metrics of the environment.
    They will now get fully operated and tested services in a few hours.

- en: The VMware operation team have created templates for all of their applications,
    alongside their configurations, through vRA. This automation tool minimizes the
    end-to end application provisioning time from a few weeks down to 36 hours. We
    are able to enhance the whole cycle to less than 24 hours after the first year.
    Automation will help not only in quick provisioning but also in maintaining consistency
    in repeated tasks. We can build development and test labs rapidly with automated,
    predefined policies, and so we avoid any human errors. VMware engineers can now
    use their time for new developments and help their operation team to be more agile.
    Employees can initiate and execute their tasks through a self-service portal.
    This means that applications are provisioned in a few hours and so the development
    team have more time for new projects. This enhances the efficiency of VMware developers
    and also reduces the security risk which comes as malicious codes, and backlogged
    jobs. VMware private cloud-based IaaS will also help in annual savings of both
    CapEx and OpEx costs. VMware is able to minimize the cost as well as enhance the
    services to their end customers. They have focused more on output and quick response
    to achieve agility in services to improve customer experiences. We are happy with
    our automated delivery process, but we can also develop other processes based
    on VMware software-defined services by using the hybrid cloud model. We have to
    be competitive in this market by regularly upgrading IT services as per business
    demands.

    Transformation with IoT*, we will learn about VMware Pulse IoT use cases in different
    domains such as health, research, science, and retail. We will learn about the
    application and data utilization from the data center to cloud to edge devices
    by transforming a network for IoT and understanding how to manage and process
    massive amounts of data across edge devices.
