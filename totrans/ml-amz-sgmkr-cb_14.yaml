    This is not always the case in big data, as with big data comes an increasing
    data variety. Image, text, and geospatial data is becoming increasingly valuable
    in gaining insight and providing solutions to the most complex problems. Recently,
    for instance, **location-based** data has been used to improve the effectiveness
    of advertising campaigns. For example, different ads can be shown to users according
    to their location; if they are coffee lovers and close to coffee shops, push notifications
    could be sent to their mobile devices. In other cases, chatbots, based on advanced
    text analytics or natural language processing, provide businesses with an efficient
    and effective avenue to solve customer problems. What is most interesting and
    an emerging approach to solving commercial problems is the use of **multimodal**
    datasets, which combine different variable types in the same project.

    limitations on the volume of words to use. More than words, body language, tonality,
    and words' context are crucial to effective communication. For example, using
    the same set of words, *the cat is bigger than the dog* has a different meaning
    to *the dog is bigger than the cat*. Naturally, humans understand, draw conclusions,
    and make predictions of the future based on free text. The use of free text comes
    with valuable information and rich insights can be harvested from it. Yet, since
    free text fails to follow a consistent structure, they pose challenges to being
    processed by machines.
  prefs: []

- en: Conversations and other forms of free text are messy and unstructured as they
    do not fit neatly into traditional tables with rows and columns. **Natural Language
    Processing** (**NLP**) sits at the intersection of data science and linguistics
    and involves the systematic use of advanced processes for analysis, understanding,
    and the extraction of data from free text. Through NLP, scientists can leverage
    free text to generate valuable insight, which is then integrated as features in
    building better-performing models. Text mining allows the identification of unique
    words or groups of words that are associated with certain outcomes. For example,
    in the house price prediction case, the description of the house improves the
    predictability of the models in estimating the house price. Thinking about it,
    the description also contributes to an individuals' decision of buying a house.
    Individuals' propensity to buy houses influences property pricing. NLP algorithms
    can identify the effect of word sequencing and influence words or phrases, and
    a word's context within sentences.

    Consequently, NLP allows machines to decide feelings described in free text by
    giving a number score to a text, indicating its sentiment to a topic or event.
    Similarly, it aids in the identification of classes that certain words most likely
    belong to. This capability has given birth to several applications, including
    text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and summarization
    of text.

    have the same word mean different things in different contexts. In a typical analytics
    process, there are numerous steps taken to normalize free text. At least four
    steps are required:'

    words. This step, also called **tokenization**, enables the identification of

    the basic units for text analytics.

    of a text. These are generally common words; for instance, in the English language,
    we have words such as *the*, *that*, *is*, and *these*. Within the context of
    text mining, these words are referred to as noise or are sometimes called stop
    words. So, this step is called **noise removal**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to this. As an illustration, **stemming** typically converts to the root word
    stem by eliminating certain letters. So, words like *happy*, *happiness*, *happily*,
    and *happiest* will all be returned to the root word *happ*. Because the same
    words could have multiple meanings, disambiguation of words becomes crucial in
    text processing. Whereas stemming returns words to their roots by cutting off
    their prefix or suffix, **lemmatization** examines the context of words to ensure
    stemmed words are converted to logical bases called **lemma**. For example, the
    word *anticipate* when stemmed might be returned to *ant*. Within the context,
    however, *ant* would not make sense; as such, lemming will ensure that the word
    *anticipate* is retained.

    pointed out how these are typically addressed in the mainstream. We proceeded
    to build models with a multimodal dataset using DataRobot and make predictions
    from the model. We also looked at a variety of ways to derive insights from the
    location, free text, and image aspects of the models. By demonstrating the process
    of model building using a multimodal dataset, we showed how DataRobot simplifies
    the handling of the challenges different data types pose.

    appears to have some limitations in terms of free text processing. Whilst the
    platform significantly simplifies the process of text processes, at the time of
    this publication, we are unsure of the extent to which domain-specific stop words
    can be included in the DataRobot process. It appears generic stop words are dropped,
    but sometimes there are domain-specific stop words that need to be accounted for.
    Elsewhere, within the context of multimodal modeling, we are unsure whether the
    text aspects of models could be tuned to include and alter the methods of stemming
    and lemming. It is therefore recommended that you perform your own text processing
    and feature engineering before feeding text into DataRobot to achieve better results.

    using the platform. Although the platform comes with numerous capabilities, these
    capabilities come with some limitations. These limitations, together with how
    they can be alleviated using programmatic access to the platform, are extensively
    covered in [*Chapter 12*](B17159_12_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176)*, DataRobot
    Python API*.
