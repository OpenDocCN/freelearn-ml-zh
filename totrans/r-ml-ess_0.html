The recent explosion of data volume and sources increased the effectiveness of solutions based on data, so this field is becoming more and more valuable. Developing a machine learning solution has specific requirements, and there are some software and tools that support it. A very good option is to use R, which is an open source programming language for statistics supported by a wide international community. The R structure is projected for statistical analysis, and the international community develops the most cutting-edge solutions. For these reasons, R allows you to develop powerful machine learning solutions using just a few lines of code.</p><p>There are machine learning tutorials, and they usually require some knowledge of the basics of statistics and computer science. This book is not just a tutorial. It doesn't even require a strong background in statistics or computer science. The target is not to provide you with a complete overview of all the techniques or to teach you how to build sophisticated solutions. This book is a path full of hands-on examples that provide you with the expertise to build a solution to a new problem. The aim is to show the most important concepts behind the approach in such a way that you have a deep understanding of machine learning and are able to identify and use the new algorithms.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The only software that you need to run the code is R, preferably 3.0.0+. It is highly recommended, although not necessary, that you install the RStudio Desktop IDE.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for those who want to learn how to perform some machine learning using R, in order to gain insight from their data and to find the solution to some real-life problems. Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning but have never used R, or perhaps you know a little R but are new to machine learning. In either case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would be helpful to have a bit of familiarity with basic programming concepts, but no prior experience is required.</p></div>
