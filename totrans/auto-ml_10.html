			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>AI and ML with GCP</h1>
			<p>Among the early<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> AI-first companies, Google has the<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> first-mover advantage in building and maintaining advanced AI platforms, accelerators, and AI building blocks. Google Cloud AI Platform is a highly comprehensive, cloud-based cognitive computing offering where you can build models and notebooks, perform data labeling, create ML jobs and pipelines, and access AI Hub:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer251" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – Google Cloud AI Platform capabilities</p>
			<p>The AI platforms and accelerators include capabilities such as building ML pipelines, deployment, and so on. It contains data labeling capabilities, platform notebooks, neural architecture search, training, and prediction functionalities.</p>
			<p>Automated ML is also one of the key building blocks, comprising AutoML Natural Language, AutoML Tables, AutoML Translation, AutoML Video, AutoML Vision, and Recommendations AI. Other AI offerings include the Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation, Cloud Vision, Dialogflow (offered in both the Essentials and Customer Experience Editions), Document AI, the Media Translation API, speech-to-text and text-to-speech services, and the Video Intelligence API. </p>
			<p>AI Platform can be <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>accessed at <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/dashboard">https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/dashboard</a> as shown in the following figure:</p>

			<p>For the purposes of this book, we will focus on AutoML capabilities within structured data, specifically AutoML Tables. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Google Cloud AI Platform and AI Hub</h1>
			<p>A part of the larger <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>AI Platform offering, Google Cloud AI Hub<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> is the one-stop shop for all things AI – it even says so on the home page. AI Hub is in beta at the time of writing. However, that shouldn't stop you from trying out its amazing one-click deployment capabilities. AI Hub and AI Platform can be confusing; the difference is in how GCP frames the problem. AI Hub focuses on enterprise-grade sharing capabilities to enable private collaboration and hosting, while AI Platform is a larger ecosystem of all things AI, including notebooks, jobs, and platforms. This is not to say that these capabilities don't overlap, and the GCP marketing team will probably come up with a cohesive strategy one day – but until then, the duality continues. </p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the AI Hub home page. You navigate to this page by clicking the AI Hub link on the AI Platform page at <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/dashboard">https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/dashboard</a>, or directly by typing <a href="https://aihub.cloud.google.com/">https://aihub.cloud.google.com/</a> in your browser:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10 – Getting started with Google Cloud AI Platform</p>
			<p>Either of these actions will take you to the <strong class="bold">Notebook instances </strong>page, as shown in the following figure. </p>
			<p>Now, to create a<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> notebook, you would create a new instance that can then be customized based on your needs. You can choose a specific language (Python 2 or 3) and framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch, among other flavors), as shown in the following figure. For the purposes of this demo, we will create a simple Python notebook. Select the <strong class="bold">Python 2 and 3</strong> option from the dropdown shown in the following figure and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer260" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11 – Creating a notebook instance on AI Platform</p>
			<p>Now you will be asked to choose the parameters of your notebook instance. This includes the region and zone where you would like to deploy the notebook. Typically, you would choose the one closest to you. Next are the operating system and environment options. In our case, we will go with <strong class="bold">Debian Linux Distro and Intel processor</strong>, which as it turns out, works really well at printing a Hello World message. You will see the environment information onscreen as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer261" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_8.12_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12 – Creating an AI Platform notebook instance – setting up the environment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12 – Creating an AI Platform notebook instance – setting up the environment</p>
			<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>selected the environment variables, you can see the estimated costs of how much you may end up spending to run this notebook instance. Speaking of money, you should be careful about leaving idle resources running in the cloud – it could be bad for your financial wellbeing. </p>
			<p>Click <strong class="screen-inline">CREATE</strong> as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.12</em> to move forward and GCP will instantiate a notebook for you with the specified parameters. You will be able to see all your notebook instances on the main <strong class="bold">Notebook instances</strong> page, as shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer262" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13 – AI Platform notebook instances enumeration </p>
			<p>The notebook <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>and its associated compute resources are ready. Now click on the <strong class="screen-inline">OPEN JUPYTERLAB</strong> link shown in the preceding screenshot to start the familiar Jupyter environment, which would appear as follows. Click on the <strong class="bold">Python 3 </strong>icon shown under the <strong class="bold">Notebook</strong> heading in the following screenshot:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.14 – AI Platform notebook options – the Jupyter Notebook environment </p>
			<p>Once you select the Python 3 <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>notebook, you will be taken to a new Jupyter notebook – an environment you should be quite familiar with. Here you can write your Python code, import libraries, and do all kinds of data-sciency things. We settled, for the purposes of this demo of course, for keeping it simple and printing <strong class="bold">Hello World</strong>. You can see this demonstration in the following figure:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.15 – AI Platform notebook instance – running a simple Jupyter notebook </p>
			<p>This concludes our basic introduction on how to get started with AI Hub and running a simple notebook, which is the first step into the amazing GCP world. AI Platform is full of amazing tools, and we will be exploring the automated ML part of it in the next section. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Automated ML with Google Cloud</h1>
			<p>Automated ML<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> is one of the key building <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>blocks of Google Cloud AI Platform. The suite of automated ML products includes AutoML Natural Language, AutoML Tables, AutoML Translation, AutoML Video, and AutoML Vision, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer265" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_8.16_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 8.16 – AutoML products offered as part of Google Cloud AI Platform &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.16 – AutoML products offered as part of Google Cloud AI Platform </p>
			<p>The underlying<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> components of Google Cloud's automated ML offerings involve neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization approaches. However, by abstracting out all the intricacies, it is made easy for consumers to use. </p>
			<p>Google Cloud AutoML Vision<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>computer vision-based capability that helps train ML models on custom labels. You can also perform the same on Edge devices using the AutoML Vision Edge service. </p>
			<p>The AutoML Video Intelligence<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> range of products provides classification and object tracking capabilities. Currently in PreGA (beta), you can use these services to train your models to identify specific objects, shots, and segments within videos according to your own custom label definitions. These results can be extrapolated over the rest of the video to discover, detect, and track similar labels.</p>
			<p>AutoML Natural Language<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> is an unstructured text analysis service that helps you build, manage, and deploy models dealing with text files and documents. Natural language processing is an area of great interest among industry professionals and researchers alike, and if you plan to do tasks such as single - or multi-label classification entity extraction, or sentiment analysis using customized labels, AutoML makes it very easy. </p>
			<p>AutoML Translation<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> is where the automated ML approach meets <strong class="bold">Google Neural  Machine Translation</strong> (<strong class="bold">Google NMT</strong>). Google Cloud AutoML Translation allows you to upload your own datasets and augment the translations. With the calculation of BLEU, base-BLEU, and BLEU gains, AutoML Translation provides a sophisticated environment for custom model development and testing.</p>
			<p>AutoML Tables<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> truly manifests what we have read so far about automated ML – taking the power of battle-tested, planet-scale neural algorithms from Google and unleashing it on unstructured data. The Google Cloud AutoML Tables workflow is shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer266" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_8.17_B16890.jpg" alt="Figure 8.17 – Google Cloud AutoML Tables workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.17 – Google Cloud AutoML Tables workflow</p>
			<p>Getting the structured data (table input), AutoML Tables jumps into action by analyzing the input features (feature engineering), selects the model (neural architecture search), performs hyperparameter tuning, and repeatedly evaluates the model behavior to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability. Google AutoML Tables is widely used in a variety of scenarios, from maximizing revenue to optimizing financial portfolios and understanding customer churn. AutoML Tables fulfills the promise of building and deploying state-of-the-art ML models on structured data, and serves as the crown jewel of the self-service section of the Google Cloud AutoML suite.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to get started with Google Cloud AI Platform and learned about AI Hub, how to build a notebook instance, and how to run a simple program. You also learned about the different flavors of automated ML offered by GCP, including AutoML Natural Language, AutoML Tables, AutoML Translation, AutoML Video, and AutoML Vision. If the breadth of GCP offerings, capabilities, and services have left you overwhelmed, you are in good company. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will do a deep dive into Google Cloud AutoML Tables.
