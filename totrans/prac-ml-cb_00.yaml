- en: Data in today’s world is the new **black gold** which is growing exponentially.
    This growth can be attributed to the growth of existing data, and new data in
    a structured and unstructured format from multiple sources such as social media,
    Internet, documents and the Internet of Things. The flow of data must be collected,
    processed, analyzed, and finally presented in real time to ensure that the consumers
    of the data are able to take informed decisions in today’s fast-changing environment.
    Machine learning techniques are applied to the data using the context of the problem to
    be solved to ensure that fast arriving and complex data can be analyzed in a scientific
    manner using statistical techniques. Using machine learning algorithms that iteratively
    learn from data, hidden patterns can be discovered. The iterative aspect of machine
    learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able
    to independently adapt and learn to produce reliable decisions from new data sets.

- en: We will start by introducing the various topics of machine learning, that will
    be covered in the book. Based on real-world challenges, we explore each of the
    topics under various chapters, such as *Classification, Clustering, Model Selection
    and Regularization, Nonlinearity, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning,
    Reinforcement Learning, Structured Prediction, Neural Networks, Deep Learning,*
    and finally the case studies. The algorithms have been developed using R as the programming
    language. This book is friendly for beginners in R, but familiarity with R programming
    would certainly be helpful for playing around with the code.

    need to use and how to implement these algorithms to get the best possible results.
    If you want to build versatile applications that can make sense of images, text,
    speech, or some other form of data, this book on machine learning will definitely
    come to your rescue!

    have used R to build various solutions. We focused on how to utilize various R
    libraries and functions in the best possible way to overcome real-world challenges.
    We have tried to keep all the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel
    that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use
    it in different scenarios.
