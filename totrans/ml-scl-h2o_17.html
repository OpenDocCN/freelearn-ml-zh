			<p>In this section, we will introduce the full-featured H2O AI Cloud platform. Importantly, we will recognize that what we have learned about in this book (ML at scale with H2O) can be implemented on its own or out of the box as a part of the larger H2O AI Cloud. We will first familiarize ourselves with the H2O AI Cloud components and where H2O-3, Sparkling Water, Enterprise Steam, and the MOJO fit. We will take this new knowledge and iterate examples of exciting new ways to build ML workflows and solutions using the H2O AI Cloud.</p>
