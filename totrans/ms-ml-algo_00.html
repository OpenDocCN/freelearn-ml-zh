<p class="mce-root"><span><span>In the last few years, machine learning has become a more and more important field in the majority of industries. Many tasks once considered impossible to automate are now completely managed by computers, allowing human beings to focus on more creative tasks. This revolution has been made possible by the dramatic improvement of standard algorithms, together with a continuous reduction in hardware prices. The complexity that was a huge obstacle only a decade ago is now a problem than even a personal computer can solve. The general availability of high-level open source frameworks has allowed everybody to design and train extremely powerful models.</span></span></p>
<p>The main goal of this book is to introduce the reader to complex techniques (such as semi-supervised and manifold learning, probabilistic models, and neural networks), balancing mathematical theory with practical examples written in Python. I wanted to keep a pragmatic approach, focusing on the applications but not neglecting the necessary theoretical foundation. In my opinion, a good knowledge of this field can be acquired only by understanding the underlying logic, which is always expressed using mathematical concepts. This extra effort is rewarded with a more solid awareness of every specific choice and helps the reader understand how to apply, modify, and improve all the algorithms in specific business contexts.</p>
<p>Machine learning is an extremely wide field and it's impossible to cover all the topics in a book. In this case, I've done my best to cover a selection of algorithms belonging to supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning, providing all the references necessary to further explore each of them. The examples have been designed to be easy to understand without any deep insight into the code; in fact, I believe it's more important to show the general cases and let the reader improve and adapt them to cope with particular scenarios. I apologize for mistakes: even if many revisions have been made, it's possible that some details (both in the formulas and in the code) got away. I hope this book will be the starting point for many professionals struggling to enter this fascinating world with a pragmatic and business-oriented viewpoint!</p>

<p>The ideal audience for this book is computer science students and professionals who want to acquire detailed knowledge of complex machine learning algorithms and applications. The approach is always pragmatic; however, the theoretical part requires some advanced mathematical skills that all graduates (in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or science) should have acquired. The book can be also utilized by more business-oriented professionals (such as CPOs and product managers) to understand how machine learning can be employed to improve existing products and businesses.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>There are no strict prerequisites for this book; however, it's important to have basic-intermediate Python knowledge with a specific focus on NumPy. Whenever necessary, I will provide instructions/references to install specific packages and exploit more advanced functionalities. </span><span>As Python is based on a semantic indentation, the published version can contain incorrect newlines that raise exceptions when executing the code. For this reason, I invite all readers without deep knowledge of this language to refer to the original source code provided with the book.</span></p>
<p>All the examples are based on Python 3.5+. I suggest using the Anaconda distribution (<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a>), which is probably the most complete and powerful one for scientific projects. The majority of the required packages are already built in and it's very easy to install the new ones (sometimes with optimized versions). However, any other Python distribution can be used. Moreover, I invite readers to test the examples using Jupyter (formerly known as IPython) notebooks so as to avoid rerunning the whole example when a change is made. If instead an IDE is preferred, I suggest PyCharm, which offers many built-in functionalities that are very helpful in data-oriented and scientific projects (<span>such as</span> the internal Matplotlib viewer).</p>
<p>A good mathematics background is necessary to fully understand the theoretical part. In particular, basic skills in probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra are required. However, I advise you not to give up when a concept seems too difficult. The reference sections contain many useful books, and the majority of concepts are explained quite well on Wikipedia too. When something unknown is encountered, I suggest reading the specific documentation before continuing. In many cases, it's not necessary to have complete knowledge and even an introductory paragraph can be enough to understand their rationale.</p>
