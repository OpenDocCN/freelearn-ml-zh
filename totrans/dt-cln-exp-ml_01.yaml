    sequentially, to see myself as cleaning data, then preprocessing, and so on until
    I have done model validation. I do not want to think about that process as involving
    phases that ever end. We start with data cleaning in this section, but I hope
    the chapters in this section convey that we are always looking ahead, anticipating
    modeling challenges as we clean data; and that we also typically reflect back
    on the data cleaning we have done when we evaluate our models.

    for subsequent analysis. The real concern is how representative our instances
    and attributes (observations and variables) are of phenomena of interest. This
    can always be improved, and easily made worse without care. One thing is for certain
    though. There is nothing we can do in any other part of the model building process
    that will make right something important we have gotten wrong during data cleaning.

- en: 'The first three chapters of this book are about getting our data as right as
    we can. To do that we have to have a good sense of how all variables, features
    and targets, are distributed. There are three questions we should ask ourselves
    before we do any formal analysis: 1) Are we confident that we know the full range
    of values, and the shape of the distribution, of every variable of interest? 2)
    Do we have a good idea of the bivariate relationship between variables, how each
    moves with others? 3) How successful are our attempts to fix potential problems,
    such as outliers and missing values? The chapters in this section provide the
    tools you need to answer these questions.'
