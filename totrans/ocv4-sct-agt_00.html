<p class="mce-root">Computer vision systems are deployed in the Arctic Ocean to spot icebergs at night. They are flown over the Amazon rainforest to create aerial maps of fires, blights, and illegal logging. They are set up in ports and airports worldwide to scan for suspects and contraband. They are sent to the depths of the Marianas Trench to guide autonomous submarines. They are used in operating rooms to help surgeons visualize the planned procedure and the patient's current condition. They are launched from battlefields as the steering systems of heat-seeking, anti-aircraft rockets.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We might seldom—or never—visit these places. However, stories often encourage us to imagine extreme environments and a person's dependence on tools in these unforgiving conditions. Perhaps fittingly, one of contemporary fiction's most popular characters is an almost ordinary man (handsome, but not <em>too</em> handsome; clever, but not <em>too</em> clever) who wears a suit, works for the British Government, always chooses the same drink, the same kind of woman, the same tone for delivering a pun, and is sent to do dangerous jobs with a peculiar collection of gadgets.</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_quote">Bond. James Bond.</div>
<p class="mce-root">This book discusses seriously useful technologies and techniques, with a healthy dose of inspiration from spy fiction. The Bond franchise is rich in ideas about detection, disguise, smart devices, image capture, and sometimes, even computer vision specifically. With imagination, plus dedication to learning new skills, we can become the next generation of gadget makers to rival Bond's engineer, Q!</p>

<p>This book is for tinkerers (and spies) who want to make computer vision a practical and fun part of their lifestyle. You should already be comfortable with 2D graphical concepts, object-oriented languages, GUIs, networking, and the command line. This book does not assume experience with any specific libraries or platforms. Detailed instructions cover everything from setting up the development environment to deploying finished apps.</p>
<p>A desire to learn multiple technologies and techniques, and then integrate them, is highly beneficial! This book will help you branch out to understand several types of systems and application domains where computer vision is relevant, and will help you to apply several approaches to detect, recognize, track, and augment faces, objects, and motions.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>You can edit </span><kbd><span class="CodeInTextPACKT">/etc/modules</span></kbd><span> to check whether </span><kbd><span class="CodeInTextPACKT">bcm2835-v4l2</span></kbd><span> is already listed there.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>set PYINSTALLER=pyinstaller<br/><br/>REM Remove any previous build of the app.<br/>rmdir build /s /q<br/>rmdir dist /s /q<br/><br/>REM Train the classifier.<br/>python HistogramClassifier.py</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>        &lt;<span>activity<br/></span><span>            </span><span>android</span><span>:name=</span><span>"<strong>.CameraActivity</strong>"<br/></span><span>            </span><strong><span>android</span><span>:screenOrientation=</span><span>"landscape"<br/></span><span>            </span><span>android</span><span>:theme=</span><span>"@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"</span></strong>&gt;<br/>            &lt;<span>intent-filter</span>&gt;<br/>                &lt;<span>action </span><span>android</span><span>:name=</span><span>"android.intent.action.MAIN" </span>/&gt;<br/><br/>                &lt;<span>category </span><span>android</span><span>:name=</span><span>"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" </span>/&gt;<br/>            &lt;/<span>intent-filter</span>&gt;<br/>        &lt;/<span>activity</span>&gt;</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="color: black">$ <strong>echo "bcm2835-v4l2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules </strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Click the <span class="packt_screen">Android</span> platform and then the <span class="packt_screen">Switch Platform</span> button.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
