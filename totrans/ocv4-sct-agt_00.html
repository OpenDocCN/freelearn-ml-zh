                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Computer vision systems are deployed in the Arctic Ocean to spot icebergs at night. They are flown over the Amazon rainforest to create aerial maps of fires, blights, and illegal logging. They are set up in ports and airports worldwide to scan for suspects and contraband. They are sent to the depths of the Marianas Trench to guide autonomous submarines. They are used in operating rooms to help surgeons visualize the planned procedure and the patient's current condition. They are launched from battlefields as the steering systems of heat-seeking, anti-aircraft rockets.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We might seldom—or never—visit these places. However, stories often encourage us to imagine extreme environments and a person's dependence on tools in these unforgiving conditions. Perhaps fittingly, one of contemporary fiction's most popular characters is an almost ordinary man (handsome, but not <em>too</em> handsome; clever, but not <em>too</em> clever) who wears a suit, works for the British Government, always chooses the same drink, the same kind of woman, the same tone for delivering a pun, and is sent to do dangerous jobs with a peculiar collection of gadgets.</p>
<p>Bond. James Bond.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book discusses seriously useful technologies and techniques, with a healthy dose of inspiration from spy fiction. The Bond franchise is rich in ideas about detection, disguise, smart devices, image capture, and sometimes, even computer vision specifically. With imagination, plus dedication to learning new skills, we can become the next generation of gadget makers to rival Bond's engineer, Q!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book is for tinkerers (and spies) who want to make computer vision a practical and fun part of their lifestyle. You should already be comfortable with 2D graphical concepts, object-oriented languages, GUIs, networking, and the command line. This book does not assume experience with any specific libraries or platforms. Detailed instructions cover everything from setting up the development environment to deploying finished apps.</p>
<p>A desire to learn multiple technologies and techniques, and then integrate them, is highly beneficial! This book will help you branch out to understand several types of systems and application domains where computer vision is relevant, and will help you to apply several approaches to detect, recognize, track, and augment faces, objects, and motions.</p>

<div><div><div><p><a href="e3ac8266-975b-43ca-8221-482a15eb0e05.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Preparing for the Mission</em>, helps us to install OpenCV, a Python development environment, and an Android development environment on Windows, macOS, or Linux systems. In this chapter, we also install a Unity development environment on Windows or macOS.</p>
<p><a href="4ec4e82a-b63d-4fc1-bf3b-47c653c25a79.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Searching for Luxury Accommodations Worldwide</em>, helps us to classify images of real estate based on color schemes. Are we outside a luxury dwelling or inside a Stalinist apartment? In this chapter, we use the classifier in a search engine that labels its image results.</p>
<p><a href="49c9a5fb-89a3-4c0d-bbee-021d2618168c.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Training a Smart Alarm to Recognize the Villain and His Cat</em>, helps us to detect and recognize human faces and cat faces as a means of controlling an alarm. Has Ernst Stavro Blofeld returned, with his blue-eyed Angora cat?</p>
<p><a href="61bdd7aa-b605-4061-8bfe-71084c7c7104.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Controlling a Phone App with Your Suave Gestures</em>, helps us to detect motion and recognize gestures as a means of controlling a guessing game on a smartphone. The phone knows why Bond is nodding, even if no one else does.</p>
<p><a href="b4619968-1f90-45f0-8a77-3505624bc0c0.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Equipping Your Car with a Rearview Camera and Hazard Detection</em>, helps us to detect car headlights, classify their color, estimate distances to them, and provide feedback to the driver. Is that car tailing us?</p>
<p><a href="5c9b90d0-e860-4d65-8af2-9d6537a2e0c7.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>,<em> </em><em>Creating a Physics Simulation Based on a Pen and Paper Sketch</em>, helps us to draw a ball-in-a-maze puzzle on paper, and see it come to life as a physics simulation on a smartphone. Physics and timing are everything!</p>
<p><a href="7cc1c0b9-a764-4069-9d45-e8bf129efc57.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Seeing a Heartbeat with a Motion-Amplifying Camera</em>, helps us to amplify motion in live video, in real time, so that a person's heartbeat and breathing become clearly visible. See the passion!</p>
<p><a href="7cc1c0b9-a764-4069-9d45-e8bf129efc57.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Stopping Time and Seeing like a Bee</em>, helps us improve the previous chapter's project by adopting specialized cameras for high-speed, infrared, or ultraviolet imaging. Surpass the limits of human vision!</p>
<div><p><a href="ddc68808-2fe3-4064-b333-632e68bb4ddf.xhtml">Appendix A</a>, <em>Making WxUtils.py Compatible with Raspberry Pi</em>, helps us solve a compatibility issue that affects the wxPython GUI library in some Raspberry Pi environments.</p>
<p><a href="01685b22-2dcc-4d5b-ac19-0b8a15e0e3b1.xhtml">Appendix B</a>, <em>Learning More about Feature Detection in OpenCV</em>, helps us discover more of OpenCV's feature-detection capabilities, beyond the ones we use in this book's projects.</p>
<p><a href="c44b1aaa-fe12-4054-85fb-37d584f15d3b.xhtml">Appendix C</a>, <em>Running with Snakes (or, First Steps with Python)</em>, helps us learn to run Python code and test an OpenCV installation in a Python environment.</p>

Here is an example: "You can edit <kbd>/etc/modules</kbd> to check whether <kbd>bcm2835-v4l2</kbd> is already listed there."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>set PYINSTALLER=pyinstaller<br/><br/>REM Remove any previous build of the app.<br/>rmdir build /s /q<br/>rmdir dist /s /q<br/><br/>REM Train the classifier.<br/>python HistogramClassifier.py</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>        &lt;activity<br/>            android:name="<strong>.CameraActivity</strong>"<br/>            <strong>android:screenOrientation="landscape"<br/>            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"</strong>&gt;<br/>            &lt;intent-filter&gt;<br/>                &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;<br/><br/>                &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;<br/>            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;<br/>        &lt;/activity&gt;</pre>
