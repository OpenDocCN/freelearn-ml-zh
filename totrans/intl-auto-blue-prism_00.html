			<p>Over the last decade, two automation trends have transformed the way that companies operate. The first trend is the use of <strong class="bold">Robotic Process Automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">RPA</strong>) technology to automate back-office computer tasks. The second trend, currently in progress, aims to automate work that was previously considered immune to automation. This is <strong class="bold">Intelligent Automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">IA</strong>), which combines RPA with <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) to automate worker intelligence and <span class="No-Break">complex decision-making.</span></p>
			<p>The term IA means different things depending on where it’s used. For some, IA means incorporating AI features into RPA products to simplify the development of automation, or adding self-healing to help the digital workers recover from errors. In this book, IA means the <em class="italic">use of ML with RPA to replace human cognitive work during the execution of an automated process</em>. While there’s value in helping developers work more effectively, IA should be primarily defined by its ability to transform operations and drive business benefits through the use of ML at a <span class="No-Break">massive scale.</span></p>
			<p>There are already a few IA books out there. They’re mostly focused on selling the high-level vision and benefits of IA. However, with the incredible boom of ML, most companies are already buying into the idea of IA and allocating budgets to ML. This signals that we need to start moving away from the <strong class="bold">why</strong> of IA onto <span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">how</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This book intends to bridge that gap and show readers how to put IA into practice through hands-on examples with <strong class="bold">Blue Prism</strong> (<strong class="bold">BP</strong>), a pioneering software firm in the RPA and IA space. Many technology books are pieced together by combining existing sources, such as online articles and courses. This book is different; it’s an extension of my thesis research at MIT about IA and how to manage its risks. I’ve combined this research with my own BP expertise to write a practitioner-focused IA book with content that, to my knowledge, doesn’t exist <span class="No-Break">anywhere else.</span></p>
			<p>For companies, IA won’t just be a “nice-to-have.” The ability to operationalize ML predictions in everyday work will likely become a <em class="italic">condition of survival</em> for most firms in the future. People with a nuanced, as opposed to a high-level, understanding of IA will be able to differentiate themselves in the marketplace. This book will provide you with this nuanced understanding of IA and guide you and your company toward better <span class="No-Break">IA outcomes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p><em class="italic">This book is for BP practitioners who are exploring IA or are looking to improve their current IA program. Regardless of whether you’re a developer, a citizen developer, a solution designer, or a COE team member, there’s something for you in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">this book.</em></span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Those who focus on implementation will learn different ways to design BP solutions for IA. Process controllers and IA program management can also read this book to understand how ML will add complexity to their automation programs, and ways to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">manage it.</em></span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You should have completed the BP Foundation Training course on the BP University website. Ideally, readers will also have at least three months of hands-on <span class="No-Break">BP experience.</span></p>
			<p>The focus of this book is on IA, or how to connect RPA with ML in a way that manages the impact that uncertain ML predictions can have on your automated business process. ML experience is not required, and knowing how to build models is outside the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>However, there’s some basic ML terminology that will be used throughout this book. First, we have <strong class="bold">regression</strong> versus <strong class="bold">classification</strong>. These two terms broadly separate the type of ML prediction that we’re trying to make. For <em class="italic">regression</em> problems, we’re looking to predict a numerical value, for instance, forecasting <span class="No-Break">sales numbers.</span></p>
			<p>For <em class="italic">classification</em> problems, we’re looking to categorize something. The different categories that we’re trying to predict are called <strong class="bold">labels</strong>. For example, we might be trying to separate customer support tickets into different categories: <em class="italic">Complaint</em>, <em class="italic">Refund</em>, and <em class="italic">Sales Enquiry</em>. These three are the <em class="italic">labels</em> of our <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">classification</em></span><span class="No-Break"> problem.</span></p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">confidence score</strong> is a number that is returned with almost every ML prediction, and it represents how confident the service is of that prediction. This interval will range between 0 and 1, or 0 to 100. For example, if you send in a photo of an animal into an ML model, it may reply that the <em class="italic">label</em> “cat” has 0.96 <em class="italic">confidence</em>, and that the <em class="italic">label</em> “tiger” has <span class="No-Break">0.99 </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">confidence</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This book is example-heavy and was written so that it can be completed with free tools. This includes the version of BP and the ML services, which all have free monthly usage limits. The following requirements are needed for the entirety of this book. Each of the other chapters might also have their own requirements <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>

			<p><em class="italic">Part 1</em><strong class="bold"> of this book discusses </strong>three different ways to interface BP with ML models so that ML predictions can be used in an automated process. <a href="B18416_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a> discusses how to use pre-built assets from the BP Digital Exchange to connect to cloud-based ML-as-a-service offerings. This is the fastest way to get started with ML as the models are ready to use. We’ll also go through an overview of what ML services are currently available and what IA use cases they can <span class="No-Break">potentially fulfill.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18416_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a> shows how to connect BP to ML by triggering ML programs to run through the Windows Command Prompt or from PowerShell. We’ll cover which BP VBOs can be used to call such programs and the different ways to capture the results <span class="No-Break">in BP.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, <a href="B18416_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a> shows how to connect BP to ML by directly running C# or VB.NET code in an object code stage. Here, we’ll discuss how to port an existing ML program’s source code so that it runs directly from an object. The ML program used in this chapter is built from ML.NET, Microsoft’s <span class="No-Break">ML framework.</span></p>
