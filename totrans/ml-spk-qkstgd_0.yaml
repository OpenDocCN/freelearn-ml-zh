- en: Every person and every organization in the world manages data, whether they
    realize it or not. Data is used to describe the world around us and can be used
    for almost any purpose, from analyzing consumer habits in order to recommend the
    latest products and services to fighting disease, climate change, and serious
    organized crime. Ultimately, we manage data in order to derive value from it,
    whether personal or business value, and many organizations around the world have
    traditionally invested in tools and technologies to help them process their data
    faster and more efficiently in order to deliver actionable insights.

- en: But we now live in a highly interconnected world driven by mass data creation
    and consumption, where data is no longer rows and columns restricted to a spreadsheet
    but an organic and evolving asset in its own right. With this realization comes
    major challenges for organizations as we enter the intelligence-driven fourth
    industrial revolution—how do we manage the sheer amount of data being created
    every second in all of its various formats (think not only spreadsheets and databases,
    but also social media posts, images, videos, music, online forums and articles,
    computer log files, and more)? And once we know how to manage all of this data,
    how do we know what questions to ask of it in order to derive real personal or
    business value?

- en: The focus of this book is to help us answer those questions in a hands-on manner
    starting from first principles. We introduce the latest cutting-edge technologies
    (the big data ecosystem, including Apache Spark) that can be used to manage and
    process big data. We then explore advanced classes of algorithms (machine learning,
    deep learning, natural language processing, and cognitive computing) that can
    be applied to the big data ecosystem to help us uncover previously hidden relationships
    in order to understand what the data is telling us so that we may ultimately solve
    real-world challenges.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at business analysts, data analysts, data scientists, data
    engineers, and software engineers for whom a typical day may currently involve
    analyzing data using spreadsheets or relational databases, perhaps using VBA,
    **Structured Query Language** (**SQL**), or even Python to compute statistical
    aggregations (such as averages) and to generate graphs, charts, pivot tables and
    other reporting mediums.

- en: With the explosion of data in all of its various formats and frequencies, perhaps
    you are now challenged with not only managing all of that data, but understanding
    what it is telling you. You have most likely heard the terms **big data**, **artificial
    intelligence**, and **machine learning**, but now wish to understand where to
    start in order to take advantage of these new technologies and frameworks, not
    just in theory but in practice as well, to solve your business challenges. If
    this sounds familiar, then this book is for you!

- en: Though this book aims to explain everything from first principles, it would
    be advantageous (though not strictly required) to have a basic knowledge of mathematical
    notation and basic programming skills in a language that can be used for data
    transformation, such as SQL, Base SAS, R, or Python. A good website for beginners
    to learn about SQL and Python is [https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com).

    with the CentOS Linux 7 (or Red Hat Linux) operating system. If you do not, [Chapter
    2](673f253e-c30f-41af-b5e0-e5fd301f829c.xhtml),* Setting Up a Local Development
    Environment*, describes the various options available to provision a CentOS 7
    **virtual machine** (**VM**), including via cloud-computing platforms such as
    **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**), Microsoft Azure, and **Google Cloud Platform**
    (**GCP**), virtual private server hosting companies or free virtualization software
    such as Oracle VirtualBox and VMWare Workstation Player that can be installed
    on your local physical device, such as a desktop or laptop.
