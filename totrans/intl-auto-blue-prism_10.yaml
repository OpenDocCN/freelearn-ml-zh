    of RPA. It distills BP’s 20+ years of automation experience and best practices
    into a framework that can be applied to all types of firms. This framework’s purpose
    is to help ensure the continued success and growth of automation in a company.
    This includes areas that may not be immediately obvious, such as securing executive
    sponsorship, developing career paths, choosing an appropriate organizational structure,
    and facilitating cultural adoption.

    see it being used across their business. Despite executive support, we should
    still work out how IA can be measured as contributing to the overall corporate
    strategy. Commonly used KPIs, such as **full-time employee** (**FTE**) savings
    and hours returned to business, rely on quantifying how much time is saved by
    Digital Workers versus human workers. But for IA, the amount of time saved can
    be negligible – for instance, if we’re replacing an expert’s decision-making process
    that takes only minutes to perform. We may need to shift from time-based and dollar
    savings-based KPI measurements to *business-value-based* assessments. Examples

    We still have the traditional RPA costs, but we also have the costs of ML on top
    of that. Three primary scenarios lead to different ML costs on an IA project.
    The first case is if ML development is outsourced to a third party. This will
    likely have fixed and variable development costs. There are also possible ongoing
    service costs if the model is hosted by a third party. If the model is deployed
    back on-premises and managed completely by internal teams, there will still be
    internal ongoing costs. The second is consuming ML through an API service, which
    incurs per-transaction costs. These costs can be forecasted based on expected
    work volumes and the API pricing.
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third scenario is if ML is developed in-house. Through cursory research,
    I found that deploying an in-house ML solution into production for the first time
    costs roughly 100,000 USD, excluding RPA costs. IA is similar to introducing any
    new technology, in that there are high costs for the first project, but the marginal
    costs decrease as more IA projects are deployed into production. Deciding to build
    ML in-house should be thought of as a multi-year endeavor, not as a one-off or
    pilot. The costs of in-house ML are mostly from salaries and renting hardware.

    We also need to consider whether the use of an ML model is advisable from a fairness
    and ethical perspective. Currently, very few companies have AI ethics policies
    in place. Some potential starting points for developing internal ethical guidelines
    are the *IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems*

    when the collected data underrepresents certain populations when it shouldn’t.
    Data quality refers to the presence of “desirable properties,” such as having
    a sufficient number of samples and having features that are highly relevant to
    the prediction that we’re trying to make. Data drift refers to changes in the
    underlying input data distributions that occur naturally over time. An example
    of data drift can be seen in consumer purchasing behavior. Even among similar

    First, baseline statistics need to be gathered, usually from the training data.
    Some common statistics that are calculated include the mean, maximum, minimum,
    and standard deviations of data columns. Then, new statistics are regularly recalculated
    based on the input data used in production. Governance might mandate that this
    be done monthly and that any changes in data columns with more than one standard
    deviation be manually assessed or trigger the model to be rebuilt and deployed

    elderly benefit screening phone calls with chatbots and RPA. Interviews with the
    affected employees showed that they had lower job satisfaction post-automation.
    A questionnaire called the **Work and Meaning Inventory** (**WAMI**) can be used
    to establish whether employees have experienced a loss of job meaning after IA
    is implemented.

    *job*, the *organization*, and *society*. If we think that IA will reduce job
    meaningfulness for someone, we can try to counteract this by targeting improvements
    at these different levels. For instance, at an *individual* level, we could provide
    more flexibility and autonomy to affected staff by allowing work-from-home days.
    At the *job* level, we could change the significance, visibility, and scope of
    the work of the affected people. At the *organizational* level, we could increase
    the number of corporate social responsibility activities. A more practical approach
    would be to ask affected staff whether the proposed automation has the potential
    to reduce their job satisfaction and to avoid automating those areas.'

    Removing the manual digitization and entry tasks meant that less time was spent
    looking at customer’s details. The affected staff felt more anxious and less prepared

    making access to data simpler or improving the presentation of the data through
    summary dashboards.

    message and publicize which measurable metrics will be used to evaluate the success
    of the IA program. One message that SS&C has put forward since implementing IA
    is not to cut jobs but to slow hiring down. If the goal is to cut jobs, training
    plans should be prepared to educate the staff that will be retained on how to
    work together with the digital workers. The job role definitions for staff should
    also be revised. These two actions can help reduce the perception of job insecurity.

    it isn’t the primary goal of IA) is to explicitly ask managers to submit plans
    on what other value-added tasks staff will be performing post-IA implementation.

    more likely to quit if AI is adopted. Again, we should understand how staff perceive
    AI and target use cases that affect employees with positive AI perceptions. Turnover
    intention is weakened when employees feel they have support from the company.

    of financial loss is from incorrect predictions, which lead to further incorrect

    SLA might also include *quality-based targets*, which would depend on the accuracy
    of the model that’s used. An example of a quality-based target would be to maintain
    a customer satisfaction score above 3/5.

    it’s a new *source of downtime*. Many ML models are cloud-hosted on major cloud
    platforms, such as GCP, AWS, and Azure. In December 2021, AWS had multiple outages
    during the workday. Azure also had a major outage in January 2023\. If your model
    was hosted there at that time, there’s a chance that you’d have an SLA breach
    due to the ML model being unavailable.

    the data scientists to provide different examples of prediction responses so that
    they can be mocked in BP. This allows RPA developers to test their work locally,
    even if the ML program isn’t ready yet. The functional requirements should also

    The deployment methodology that’s used for the ML model informs the Control Room
    operators of how the overall IA solution must be updated, to maintain auditability,
    and also how to roll back in case there’s an issue with the newly deployed model.
    It’s recommended to choose a deployment method that doesn’t require downtime to
    roll back and for the prediction response of the model to return the model version
    that was used to make the prediction, for auditing purposes. Deploying new ML
    models should also require a formal change request, which requires approval.

    ML model (this can be assessed through random sampling), and potentially the SLAs
    for human review. Each ML model will have their own ML reviewers, who potentially

    This is usually done through web-based dashboards that read ML server logs. This
    works if ML is deployed through Web APIs, but not if models are called through
    the CLI or Code Stages. In this case, the support model needs to include exporting
    ML results, from the Work Queue or Session Logs, to data scientists for analysis,
    and ingestion into monitoring systems. Regardless of the method used by BP to
    make the ML prediction, we still need to feedback information regarding reviewed
    predictions to the data scientists as that data isn’t present in ML API server
    logs.

    although it isn’t directly one of the two) is something called *time lag effects*.
    Imagine that we’re a bank that’s using ML to determine whether an account opening
    application is fraudulent or not. If the ML model is flawed, many fraudulent account
    creation requests will be processed further, with the data being sent to many
    other systems. Thousands of account opening applications might have been processed
    before the model flaw was detected. The amount of work that needs to be undone
    or corrected between making an incorrect ML prediction, and discovering it, is
    a time lag effect.

    model needs to consider how to deal with individual cases – for example, if a
    business user flags a case where an incorrect ML prediction has led to incorrect
    processing. The support model also needs to deal with batch cases, which can be
    caused by flawed ML models. It might even be necessary to create a separate automated
    process specifically to undo the steps that were performed by the IA solution
    post-prediction.

    Is it the business users who have signed off on the model testing results? Is

    it’s almost impossible to prove that the algorithm is defective.
