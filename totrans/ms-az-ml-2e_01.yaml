- en: In this section, we will learn about the history of **Machine Learning** (**ML**),
    the scenarios in which to apply ML, the statistical knowledge necessary, and the
    steps and components required for running a custom end-to-end ML project. We will
    have a look at the available Azure services for ML and we will learn about the
    scenarios they are best suited for. Finally, we will introduce Azure Machine Learning,
    the main service we will utilize throughout the rest of the book. We will understand
    how to deploy this service and use it to run our first ML experiments in the cloud.
