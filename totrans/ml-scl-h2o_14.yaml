- en: In this section, we put on our enterprise stakeholder hats and learn how to
    plan for, deploy, administer, maintain, and secure the H2O at scale platform.
    You will first understand how Enterprise Steam works to integrate H2O with your
    enterprise server cluster and security environment. You will then learn how to
    configure Enterprise Steam to govern users and define the size of their H2O model-building
    environments, thereby controlling resource consumption and cost on your enterprise
    cluster. From there, we learn key areas of operations to support model building
    and deployment with H2O. Finally, we learn the details of H2O architecture and
    security from multiple architecture views. Data scientists are shown how these
    activities relate to their own needs.
