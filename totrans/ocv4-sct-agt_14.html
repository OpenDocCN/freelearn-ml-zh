<p>This appendix assumes that you have already set up a Python environment and OpenCV's Python bindings, as instructed in <a href="e3ac8266-975b-43ca-8221-482a15eb0e05.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Preparing for the Mission</em>. Now, if you are new to Python, you are probably wondering how to test this environment and run Python code.</p>
<p>Python offers an interactive interpreter, so you can test code without even having to save your source code to a file. Open the operating system's Terminal or Command Prompt, and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ python</strong></pre>
<p>Python will print its version information and then show a prompt, <kbd>&gt;&gt;&gt;</kbd>, for its interactive interpreter. You can enter code at this prompt and Python will print the code's return value, if any. For example, if we enter <kbd>1+1</kbd>, we should see the following text:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1+1</strong><br/><strong>2</strong></pre>
<p>Now, let's try to import the OpenCV Python module, which is called <kbd>cv2</kbd>:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; import cv2</strong></pre>
<p>If your OpenCV installation is in good shape, this line of code should run silently. On the other hand, if you see an error, you should go back and review the setup steps. If the error says, <span class="s1"><kbd>ImportError: No module named 'cv2'</kbd>, this suggests that Python did not find the <kbd>cv2.pyd</kbd> file (the OpenCV Python module) in Python's <kbd>site-packages</kbd> folder. On Windows, if the error says</span>, <kbd>ImportError: DLL load failed</kbd>. This suggests that Python succeeded in finding the <kbd>cv2.pyd</kbd> file, but failed to find one of the module's DLL dependencies, such as one of the OpenCV DLLs or (in a custom build using TBB) the TBB DLL; perhaps the folder containing the DLL is missing from the system's <kbd>Path</kbd>.</p>
<p>Assuming that we succeeded in importing <kbd>cv2</kbd>, now we can get its version number, as seen in the following snippet:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; cv2.__version__<br/><span class="s1">'4.0.1'</span></strong></pre>
<p>Make sure the output matches the OpenCV version you believed you had installed. If not, <span>go back and review the setup steps.</span></p>
<p>When you are ready to exit the Python interactive interpreter, enter the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; quit()</strong></pre>
<p>Throughout this book's projects, when you encounter a Python script (a <kbd>.py</kbd> file) with a <kbd>__main__</kbd> section in the code, Python can execute this script if you pass it as an argument to the Python interpreter. For example, let's suppose that we want to run the <kbd>Luxocator.py</kbd> script from <a href="4ec4e82a-b63d-4fc1-bf3b-47c653c25a79.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Searching for Luxury Accommodations Worldwide</em>. At the operating system's Terminal or Command Prompt, we would run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ python Luxocator.py</strong></pre>
<p>Then, Python would execute the <kbd>__main__</kbd> section of <kbd>Luxocator.py</kbd>. This section of the script would, in turn, invoke other sections.</p>
<p>You do not need any special tools to create and edit <kbd>.py</kbd> files. A text editor will suffice, and minimalists may prefer it. Alternatively, a variety of dedicated Python editors and IDEs offer features such as autocompletion. I sometimes use a text editor and other times an IDE called <strong>PyCharm</strong> (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/</a>), which has a free community edition.</p>
<p>Here, we have covered just the bare minimum to enable you to run and edit Python code. This book does not include a guide to the Python language per se, although, certainly, the book's projects can help you learn Python (and other languages) by example. If you want to supplement your reading of this book with a more language-focused resource, you can find many options in the official <em>Python For Beginners</em> guide at <a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/">https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/</a>, and on Packt Publishing's Python tech page at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/tech/Python">https://www.packtpub.com/tech/Python</a>.</p>
