- en: In this book, you'll start by exploring the features available in Amazon SageMaker
    Studio to analyze data, develop ML models, and productionize models to meet your
    goals. As you progress, you will learn how these features work together to address
    common challenges when building ML models in production. After that, you'll understand
    how to effectively scale and operationalize the ML life cycle using SageMaker
    Studio.

- en: This book is for data scientists and ML engineers who are looking to become
    well versed in Amazon SageMaker Studio and gain hands-on ML experience to handle
    every step in the ML life cycle, including building data as well as training and
    hosting models. Although basic knowledge of ML and data science is necessary,
    no previous knowledge of SageMaker Studio or cloud experience is required.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17447_01_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *Machine Learning
    and Its Life Cycle in the Cloud*, describes how cloud technology has democratized
    the field of ML and how ML is being deployed in the cloud. It introduces the fundamentals
    of the AWS services that are used in the book.'

    SageMaker Studio*, covers an overview of Amazon SageMaker Studio, including its
    features and functionalities and user interface components. You will set up a
    SageMaker Studio domain and get familiar with basic operations.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17447_03_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043), *Data Preparation
    with SageMaker Data Wrangler*, looks at how, with SageMaker Data Wrangler, you
    can perform exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing for ML modeling with
    a point-and-click experience (that is, without any coding). You will be able to
    quickly iterate through data transformation and modeling to see whether your transform
    recipe helps increase model performance, learn whether there is implicit bias
    in the data against sensitive groups, and have a clear record of what transformation
    has been done for the processed data.'

    Repository with SageMaker Feature Store*, looks at SageMaker Feature Store, which
    allows storing features for ML training and inferencing. Feature Store serves
    as a central repository for teams collaborating on ML use cases to avoid duplicating
    and confusing efforts in creating features. SageMaker Feature Store makes storing
    and accessing training and inferencing data easier and faster.'

    ML Models with SageMaker Studio IDE*, looks at how building and training an ML
    model can be made easy. No more frustration in provisioning and managing compute
    infrastructure. SageMaker Studio is an IDE designed for ML developers. In this
    chapter, you will learn how to use the SageMaker Studio IDE, notebooks, and SageMaker-managed
    training infrastructure.'

    and Explaining Models with SageMaker Clarify*, covers the ability to detect and
    remediate bias in data and models during the ML life cycle, which is critical
    in creating an ML model with social fairness. You will learn how to apply SageMaker
    Clarify to detect bias in your data and how to read the metrics in SageMaker Clarify.'

    in the Cloud: Best Practices*, looks at how, after successfully training a model,
    if you want to make the model available for inference, SageMaker has several options
    depending on your use case. You will learn how to host models for batch inference,
    do online real-time inference, and use multimodel endpoints for cost savings,
    as well as a resource optimization strategy for your inference needs.'

    SageMaker JumpStart and Autopilot*, looks at SageMaker JumpStart, which offers
    complete solutions for select use cases as a starter kit to the world of ML with
    Amazon SageMaker without any code development. SageMaker JumpStart also catalogs
    popular pretrained **computer vision** (**CV**) and **natural language processing**
    (**NLP**) models for you to easily deploy or fine-tune to your dataset. SageMaker
    Autopilot is an AutoML solution that explores your data, engineers features on
    your behalf, and trains an optimal model from various algorithms and hyperparameters.
    You don''t have to write any code as Autopilot does it for you and returns notebooks
    to show how it does it.'

- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B17447_09_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor125), *Training ML Models
    at Scale in SageMaker Studio*, discusses how a typical ML life cycle starts with
    prototyping and then transitions to production scale, where the data is going
    to be much larger, models are much more complicated, and the number of experiments
    grows exponentially. SageMaker Studio makes this transition easier than before.
    You will learn how to run distributed training, how to monitor the compute resources
    and modeling status of a training job, and how to manage training experiments
    with SageMaker Studio.'

    in Production with SageMaker Model Monitor*, looks at how data scientists used
    to spend too much time and effort maintaining and manually managing ML pipelines,
    a process that starts with data processing, training, and evaluation and ends
    with model hosting with ongoing maintenance. SageMaker Studio provides features
    that aim to streamline this operation with **continuous integration and continuous
    delivery** (**CI/CD**) best practices. You will learn how to implement SageMaker
    Projects, Pipelines, and the model registry, which will help operationalize the
    ML life cycle with CI/CD.'

- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B17447_11_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor144), *Operationalize ML
    Projects with SageMaker Projects, Pipelines, and Model Registry*, discusses how
    having a model put into production for inferencing isn''t the end of the life
    cycle. It is just the beginning of an important topic: how do we make sure the
    model is performing as it is designed and as expected in real life? Monitoring
    how the model performs in production, especially on data that the model has never
    seen before, is made easy with SageMaker Studio. You will learn how to set up
    model monitoring for models deployed in SageMaker, detect data drift and performance
    drift, and visualize feature importance and bias in the inferred data in real
    time.'
