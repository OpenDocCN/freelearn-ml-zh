- en: The second revision of *Learning Data Mining with Python* was written with the
    programmer in mind. It aims to introduce data mining to a wide range of programmers,
    as I feel that this is critically important to all those in the computer science
    field. Data mining is quickly becoming the building block of the next generation
    of Artificial Intelligence systems. Even if you don't find yourself building these
    systems, you will be using them, interfacing with them, and being guided by them.
    Understand the process behind them is important and helps you get the best out
    of them.

- en: The second revision builds upon the first. Many of chapters and exercises are
    similar, although new concepts are introduced and exercises are expanded in scope.
    Those that had read the first revision should be able to move quickly through
    the book and pick up new knowledge along the way and engage with the extra activities
    proposed. Those new to the book are encouraged to take their time, do the exercises
    and experiment. Feel free to break the code to understand it, and reach out if
    you have any questions.

- en: As this is a book aimed at programmers, we assume that you have some knowledge
    of programming and of Python itself. For this reason, there is little explanation
    of what the *Python* code itself is doing, except in cases where it is ambiguous.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should come as no surprise that you’ll need a computer, or access to one,
    to complete the book. The computer should be reasonably modern, but it doesn’t
    need to be overpowered. Any modern processor (from about 2010 onwards) and 4 gigabytes
    of RAM will suffice, and you can probably run almost all of the code on a slower
    system too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The exception here is with the final two chapters. In these chapters, I step
    through using Amazon’s web services (AWS) for running the code. This will probably
    cost you some money, but the advantage is less system setup than running the code
    locally. If you don’t want to pay for those services, the tools used can all be
    set-up on a local computer, but you will definitely need a modern system to run
    it. A processor built in at least 2012, and more than 4 GB of RAM are necessary.
  prefs: []

    Macs, or any other Linux variant. You may need to consult the documentation for
    your system to get some things installed though.

- en: If you haven’t programmed before, I strongly recommend that you learn at least
    the basics before you get started. This book doesn’t introduce programming, nor
    does it give too much time to explaining the actual implementation (in-code) of
    how to type out the instructions. That said, once you go through the basics, you
    should be able to come back to this book fairly quickly – there is no need to
    be an expert programmer first!

- en: I highly recommend that you have some Python programming experience. If you
    don’t, feel free to jump in, but you might want to take a look at some Python
    code first, possibly focused on tutorials using the IPython notebook. Writing
    programs in the IPython notebook works a little differently than other methods,
    such as writing a Java program in a fully-fledged IDE.
