			<p>Streaming data is the new top technology to watch in the field of data science and machine learning. As business needs become more demanding, many use cases require real-time analysis as well as real-time machine learning. This book will allow you to get up to speed with data analytics for streaming data and focuses strongly on adapting machine learning and other analytics to the case of streaming data.</p>
			<p>You will first learn about the architecture for streaming and real-time machine learning. You will then look at the state-of-the-art frameworks for streaming data such as River.</p>
			<p>You will learn about various industrial use cases for streaming data, such as online anomaly detection. Then, you will deep dive into challenges and how you will mitigate them. You will then learn the best practices that will help you use streaming data to generate real-time insights.</p>
			<p>Upon completion of the book, you will be confident about using streaming data in your machine learning models.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>Data scientists and machine learning engineers who have a basis in machine learning, are practice- and technology-oriented, and want to learn how to apply machine learning to streaming data through practical examples with modern technologies will benefit from this book. You will need to understand basic Python and machine learning concepts but require no prior knowledge of streaming.</p>
