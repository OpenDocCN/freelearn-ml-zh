- en: This part establishes the baseline for the rest of the book. It covers all the
    basic topics that need to be understood to grasp the more complex concepts (and
    implement the workloads) that come later in the book. We begin by covering some
    of the fundamental concepts of AI/ML, and we discuss examples of how AI/ML is
    used in real-world use cases. Most importantly, we discuss common challenges that
    companies often run into when implementing AI/ML projects at scale and begin discussing
    how to address such challenges, forming the basis for deeper discussions throughout
    this book. Next, we outline the steps in a typical AI/ML project lifecycle, which
    will be used to form the overall structure of much of this book. We round out
    this part by introducing Google Cloud and common AI/ML tooling.
