- en: AWS is constantly driving new innovations that empower data scientists to explore
    a variety of machine learning cloud services. This book is your comprehensive
    reference for learning about and implementing advanced machine learning algorithms
    in AWS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you go through this book, you'll gain insights into how these algorithms
    can be trained, tuned, and deployed in AWS using Apache Spark on Elastic MapReduce,
    SageMaker, and TensorFlow. While you focus on algorithms such as XGBoost, linear
    models, Factorization Machines, and deep networks, the book will also provide
    you with an overview of AWS, as well as detailed practical applications that will
    help you solve real-world problems. Every practical application includes a series
    of companion notebooks with all the necessary code to run on AWS. In the next
    few chapters, you will learn how to use SageMaker and EMR notebooks to perform
    a range of tasks, from smart analytics and predictive modeling through to sentiment
    analysis.

    practitioners face the problem of scale when attempting to run machine learning

    a very powerful tool for running very large machine learning jobs. There are many
    ways to configure EMR, and not every setup works for every scenario. We will go
    through the main configurations of EMR and explain how each configuration works
    for different objectives. Additionally, we''ll present other ways to run big data

    built on AWS and would like to ship them to production. We understand that there
    are a variety of different contexts in which models should be deployed. In some
    cases, it''s as easy as generating a CSV of actions that would be fed to some
    system. Often, we just need to deploy a web service that''s capable of making
    predictions. However, there are many times in which we need to deploy these models
    to complex, low-latency, or edge systems. We will go through the different ways
    you can deploy machine learning models to production.'
