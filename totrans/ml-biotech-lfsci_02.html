			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Some of the earliest applications of biotechnology throughout human history include the process of fermenting beer, which dates as far back as 6,000 BC, or preparing bread using yeast in 4,000 BC, or even the development of the earliest viral vaccines in the 1700s. </span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">In each of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">these examples, scientific or engineering processes utilized biological entities to produce goods. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">This concept was true then and had remained just as true throughout human history. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Throughout the 20th century, major innovative advancements were made that changed the course of mankind for the better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">In 1928, Alexander Fleming identified a mold that halted the replication of bacteria, thus leading to penicillin – the first antibiotic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">Years later, in 1955, Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine using mammalian cells. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.6">Finally, in 1975 one of the earliest methods for the development of monoclonal antibodies was developed by George Kohler and Cesar Milstein, thus reshaping the field of medicine forever:</span></p>

			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Throughout this book, Python and SQL will be the main languages we will use to develop all of our models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">We will not only go through the specific instructions of how to install each of these requirements, but we will also gain hands-on knowledge throughout the many examples and tutorials within this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">AWS and GCP will be our two main cloud-based platforms for deploying all of our models, given their commonality and popularity among data scientists. </span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">In the next chapter, we'll introduce the Python command line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">With that in mind, let's go ahead and get started!</span></p>
