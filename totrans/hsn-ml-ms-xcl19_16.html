<li>In classical programming, the code developed and run in the computer is a step-by-step set of instructions telling the computer what to do and how to handle different options. Machine learning is about showing the computer examples of data to either teach it what to do by example, or to let it learn information that is hidden in the data.</li>
<li>The machine learning models can be either regression (if the target variable is numerical and continuous) or classification (if the target variable is categorical or discrete).</li>
<li>Models that learn by example, training on labeled data, are called supervised machine learning models. In comparison, those that find information in the unlabeled data are called unsupervised machine learning models.</li>
<li>The following are the main steps that are needed when creating and using a machine learning model:
<ol>
<li>Obtaining the data and merging different data sources</li>
<li>Cleansing the data</li>
<li>Preliminary analysis and feature engineering </li>
<li>Trying different models and parameters for each of them, training them by using a percentage of the full dataset, and using the rest for testing</li>
<li>Deploying the model so that it can be used in a continuous analysis flow and not only in small, isolated tests</li>
<li>Predicting values for new input data</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>The R<sub>j</sub> residual <span>is the difference between the <em>y</em> value of the <em>j</em> data point</span> <span>and the value of the regression line that is fit for that point:</span></li>

<li>Underfitting refers to a model that fails to represent the characteristics of the dataset. Even if this seems correct, it completely lacks generalization. Overfitting refers to a model that fits so well to the training data that it lacks generalization, and it would be wrong to test it against a different dataset.</li>
<li>They need to be encoded as binary variables first.</li>

<li>The cluster distribution will depend on the initial choice of centroids. There are more advanced methods of building clusters in order to avoid this problem.</li>
