    **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**). We start by explaining why **machine learning**
    (**ML**) and cloud computing go hand in hand as the demand for ever more hungry
    computing resources grows for today's ML applications. We then proceed with a
    360° presentation of the platform's data-related services. Account and project
    creation as well as role allocation close the chapter.

    the boundaries of human knowledge and human activities. With ever more powerful
    ML platforms and open tools, we are able to conquer new realms of knowledge and
    grow new types of businesses. From the comfort of our laptops, at home, or at
    the office, we can better understand and predict human behavior in a wide range
    of domains. Think health care, transportation, energy, financial markets, human
    communication, human-machine interaction, social network dynamics, economic behavior,
    and nature (astronomy, global warming, or seismic activity). The list of domains
    affected by the explosion of AI is truly unlimited. The impact on society? Astounding.

    computational resources. Classification on the Iris or the MINST image datasets
    or predictive modeling on Titanic passengers does not reflect real-world data.
    Real-world data is by essence dirty, incomplete, noisy, multi-sourced, and more
    often than not, in large volumes. Exploiting these large datasets requires computational
    power, storage, CPUs, GPUs, and fast I/O.

    Grounded in science, data science requires a scientific mindset with concepts
    such as reproducibility and reviewing. Both aspects are made easier by working
    with online accessible resources. Sharing datasets and models and exposing results
    is always more difficult when the data lives on one person's computer. Reproducing
    results and maintaining models with new data also requires easy accessibility
    to assets. And as we work on ever more personalized and critical data (for instance
    in healthcare), privacy and security concerns become all the more important to
    the project stakeholders.

    models sometimes require resources that cannot be found on a simple standalone
    computer. Physical limitations in terms of storage have shrunk in recent years.
    As we now enjoy reliable terabyte storage accessible at reduced prices, storage
    is no longer an issue for most data projects that are not in the realm of big
    data. Computing power has also increased so much that what required expensive
    workstations a few years ago can now run on laptops.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, despite all this amazingly rapid evolution, the power of the standalone
    PC is finite. There is an upper limit to the volume of data you can store on your
    machine and to the time you're willing to wait to get your model trained. New
    frontiers in AI, with speech-to-text, video captioning in real time, self-driving
    cars, music generation, or chatbots that can fool a human being and pass the turing
    test, require ever larger resources. This is especially true of deep learning
    models, which are too slow on standard CPUs and require GPU-based machines to
    train in a reasonable amount of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is direct access to **high-performance computing** (**HPC**). Before the cloud
    (roughly before AWS launched its **Elastic Computing Cloud** (**EC2**) service
    in 2006), HPC was only available via supercomputers, such as the Cray computers.
    Cray is a US company that has built some of the most powerful supercomputers since
    the 1960s. China's Tianhe-2 is now the most powerful supercomputer in the world,
    with a capacity of 100,000 petaflops (that's 10² x 10^(15), or 10 to the power
    of 17 floating-point operations per second!).

    own physical infrastructure and has huge maintenance costs. It is also out of
    reach for individuals and for most companies. Engineers and researchers, hungry

    public versus private and multi-tenant versus single-tenant. These different cloud
    types offer different levels of management, security, and pricing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A public cloud consists of resources that are located off-site over the internet.
    In a public cloud, the infrastructure is typically multi-tenant. Multiple customers
    can share the same underlying hardware or server. Resources such as networking,
    storage, power, cooling and computing are all shared. The customer usually has
    no visibility of where this infrastructure is hosted except for choosing a geographic
    region. The pricing mode of a public cloud service is based on the volume of data,
    the computing power that is used and other infrastructure-management-related services—or,
    more precisely, a mix of RAM, vCPUs, disk, and bandwidth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a private cloud, the resources are dedicated to a single customer; the architecture
    is single-tenant instead of multi-tenant. The servers are located on premise or
    in a remote data center. Customers own (or rent) the infrastructure and are responsible
    for maintaining it. Private cloud infrastructures are more expensive to operate
    as they require dedicated hardware to be secured for a single tenant. Customers
    of the private cloud have more control over their infrastructure, and therefore
    they can achieve their compliance and security requirements.

    failure, it is the responsibility of the customer to have some mechanisms in place
    to restore the operations. Unmanaged cloud requires the customer to have the qualified
    expertise and resources to build, manage, and maintain cloud instances and infrastructures.
    Focused on self-serving applications, unmanaged cloud offers do not include support
    with their basic tiers.

    by offering monitoring, troubleshooting, and around-the-clock customer service.
    Managed cloud brings along qualified expertise and resources to the team right
    away. For many companies, having a service provider to handle their public cloud
    can be easier and more cost-effective than hiring their own staff to operate their
    clouds.

    The provider builds the infrastructure while the user deploys the software. The
    main advantage of PaaS over IaaS, besides the reduced workload and need for sysadmin
    resources, is the automatic scaling for web applications. The appropriate number
    of resources are automatically allocated as demand fluctuates. Examples of PaaS

    access to those resources for other tasks. Preemptible instances are adapted to

    is evolving quickly and requires scalability and rapid modifications. If your
    applications are very static with stable load, the cloud may not result in lower
    costs. In the end, as the cloud offers much more flexibility and opens the way
    to implementing new projects quickly, the overall cost is higher than with a fixed
    infrastructure. But this flexibility is the true benefit of cloud computing.

- en: Our Google Cloud projectFor this book I created the `packt-gcp` project. Since
    the name was unique across all other GCP projects, the project ID is also `packt-gcp`.
    And all the resources are created in the us-central1 zone.

- en: What are the GCP services? Reto Meier, software engineer at Google, describes
    the different Google Cloud services in a simple way (for more information, see
    [https://hackernoon.com/what-are-the-google-cloud-platform-gcp-services-285f1988957a](https://hackernoon.com/what-are-the-google-cloud-platform-gcp-services-285f1988957a)).
    This is very useful for grasping the diversity of the GCP services.

    on the history of the GCP. You can find it at: [https://medium.com/@retomeier/an-annotated-history-of-googles-cloud-platform-90b90f948920](https://medium.com/@retomeier/an-annotated-history-of-googles-cloud-platform-90b90f948920).
    It starts with the bullet point: *Pre 2008 — Computers invented. Google Founded...*.
    A much more detailed timeline of the GCP is available on Crunchbase at [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google-cloud-platform/timeline#/timeline/index](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google-cloud-platform/timeline#/timeline/index).'

- en: In this introductory chapter, we looked at the nature of the GCP and explored
    its services architecture. We created a new project and understood role creation
    and allocation. Although a new entrant on the cloud computing market, the GCP
    offers a complete set of services for a wide range of applications. We study these
    services in depth in the rest of this book.

    the next chapter, we'll create a VM instance on Google Compute Engine and install
    a data science Python stack with the Anaconda distribution. We'll explore the
    web UI and learn how to manage instances through the command line and the Google
    Shell.
