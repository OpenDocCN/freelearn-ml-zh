    learning. It describes the underlying distribution that governs the generation
    of potential outcomes or events in an experiment or random process. There are
    different types of probability distributions, depending on the specific domain
    and characteristics of the data. A proper probability distribution is a useful
    tool in understanding and modeling the behavior of random processes and events,
    providing convenient tools for decision-making and predictions when developing
    data-driven predictive and optimization models.'

    the behavior of random variables. Once we know the underlying data-generating
    probability distribution, we can make more informed decisions about how things
    are likely to appear, either in a predictive or optimization context. In other
    words, if the selected probability distribution can model the observed data very
    well, we have a powerful tool to predict potential future values, as well as the
    uncertainty of such occurrence.

- en: Here, a random variable is a variable whose value is not fixed and may assume
    multiple or infinitely many possible values, representing the outcomes (or realizations)
    of a random event. Probability distributions allow us to represent and analyze
    the probability of these outcomes, offering a comprehensive view of the underlying
    uncertainties in various scenarios. A probability distribution takes the random
    variable, denoted as x, and converts it into a probability, P(x), a floating number
    valued between 0 and 1\. The probability distribution can be a **probability density
    function** (**PDF**) or **probability mass function** (**PMF**) that specifies
    the probability of observing an outcome for a continuous variable (or discrete
    variable), or a **cumulative distribution function** (**CDF**) that provides the
    total probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a given fixed
    quantity.

    distribution and continuous probability distribution. A discrete probability distribution

    distribution that specifies the probability of experiencing a rainy day in a week,
    the underlying random variable is the day of the week and can only take an integer
    value between 1 and 7\. Let’s assume there is a total of C possible values for
    the discrete random variable. For a given possible value, x i, with i ∈ {1, …
    , C}, the corresponding PMF is f(x i) ∈ [0,1], and all probabilities should sum
    to 1, giving ∑ i=1 C  f( x i) = 1\. We can think of PMF f(x) as a bar chart that

    variables, which can take an infinite number of values within a specified range,
    denoted as 𝒳. The random variable, x ∈ 𝒳, is now continuous, and the corresponding
    PDF f(x) ∈ [0,1] satisfies ∫ f(x)dx = 1 for x ∈ 𝒳, where we have switched the
    summation sign to an integral to account for an infinite amount of possible values
    of the continuous variable, x. We can think of PDF f(x) as a line plot that specifies
    the probability output for each continuous input.

    distribution, the geometric distribution is a collection of multiple independent

    underlying random variable is continuous instead of discrete. These distributions
    describe the probabilities of observing values that fall within a continuous interval,
    rather than equal to individual discrete outcomes in a discrete probability distribution.
    Specifically, in a continuous probability distribution, the probability of the
    random variable equal to any specific value is typically zero, since the possible
    outcomes are uncountable. Instead, probabilities for continuous distributions
    are calculated for intervals or ranges of values.

    the PMF of a discrete probability distribution. The PDF defines the probability
    of observing a value within an infinitesimally small interval around a given point.
    The area under the PDF curve over a specific range represents the probability
    of the random variable falling within that range – that is, the probabilities
    are calculated for intervals or ranges of values by integrating the PDF over the
    desired range. In contrast, probabilities are assigned to individual points in
    a PMF, and the probabilities are calculated for a set of discrete values by summing
    up their individual probabilities.

- en: So far, we have learned how to sample from a Gaussian distribution using the
    `rnorm()` function. It helps to look at how these random samples are generated
    under the hood. This specific technique is known as the inverse transform method,
    which relies on the inverse CDF or quantile function of the target distribution
    (in this case, the normal distribution).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process involves three steps. First, we will generate random samples from
    a uniform distribution, usually U(0,1), where all values between `0` and `1` are
    equally likely. Next, for each uniform random sample, we will locate the corresponding
    value in the target distribution using the inverse CDF (quantile function) of
    the standard normal distribution. Lastly, we will apply the scale-location transformation
    to convert the standard normal random sample into a random sample from the target
    normal distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This method relies on the property that the CDF of a continuous random variable
    is a function that maps the sample space (the domain of the PDF) to the range
    of [`0`, `1`]. The inverse CDF is the inverse of the CDF and maps the interval,
    [0, 1], back to the sample space. By passing the uniform random samples into the
    inverse CDF, we reverse the mapping and obtain random samples that follow the
    target distribution, subject to additional transformation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s look at this process in greater detail. Suppose we want to sample from
    a normal distribution, N(μ, σ 2). How do we generate random samples from this
    particular distribution? One approach is to generate a random sample, x, from
    a standard normal distribution N(0,1), and then apply the scale-location transformation
    to obtain the final sample, σx + μ. By scaling the sample based on σ, followed
    by adding μ, the resulting sample will follow a normal distribution with mean,
    μ, and variance, σ 2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step of sampling from a standard normal distribution is the key, whereas
    the second step is a simple and deterministic transformation. The approach we
    introduced earlier is to transform a uniformly distributed variable using the
    inverse CDF of a standard normal distribution. For example, if U is uniformly
    distributed on [0,1], then Φ −1(U) follows N(0,1), where Φ −1 is the inverse of
    the cumulative function of a standard normal distribution.

    space, given the fact that the CDF monotonically maps an arbitrary input value
    to an output on [0,1]. Mathematically, the random sample of the standard normal
    is given by x = Φ −1(U). Considering the one-to-one mapping relationship between
    the PDF and the CDF of the standard normal, we could obtain the same input, x,
    in the PDF space as well. We would also expect most of the samples to be centered
    around the mean. Finally, we apply the scale-location transformation to convert
    to the random sample of the normal distribution with the desired mean and variance:'

    based on many samples drawn from a population. In other words, it is the distribution
    of a particular statistic (such as the mean, median, or proportion) calculated
    from many sets of samples from the same population, where each set has the same
    size. There are two things to take note of here. First, the sampling distribution
    is not about the random samples drawn from the PDF. Instead, it is a distribution
    that’s made from an aggregate statistic, which comes from another distribution
    drawn from the PDF. Second, we would need to sample from the PDF in multiple rounds
    to create the sampling distribution, where each round consists of multiple samples

    Then, we obtain the index of the bottom 5% quantile in `VaR_index`, which is then
    used to retrieve the corresponding VaR of daily returns. Finally, we convert the
    percentage return into the loss in portfolio value in `VaR_amount`. Note that
    although the result is a negative number, we often report it as a positive number
    to indicate the potential loss (or even more) that could occur in an extreme situation.

    `ggplot()` to plot a density curve using `geom_density()`. We also add a vertical
    line representing the VaR using `geom_vline()`. To shade the area below the VaR,
    we use `ggplot_build()` to filter the data and use `geom_ribbon()` to color the
    region that satisfies the filtering condition.

- en: In this chapter, we covered common probability distributions. We started by
    introducing discrete probability distributions, including the Bernoulli distribution,
    the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, and the geometric distribution.
    We followed by covering common continuous probability distributions, including
    the normal distribution, the exponential distribution, and the uniform distribution.
    Next, we introduced common sampling distributions and their use in statistical
    inferences for population statistics. Finally, we covered order statistics and
    their use in calculating the VaR in the context of daily stock returns.
