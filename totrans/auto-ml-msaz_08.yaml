    ready to tackle a more complicated problem: **forecasting**. Forecasting is inherently
    a much more complex technique than either classification or regression. Those
    two **machine learning** (**ML**) problem types assume that time is irrelevant.
    Regardless of how much time passes, your diabetes model will always be able to
    accurately predict whose condition worsens over time. Your Titanic model will
    always be able to predict who lives and who dies. In contrast, with forecasting
    problems, you are always trying to predict future events based on past events;
    time will always be a factor in your model.'

    problems are the Prophet and ARIMA algorithms. Prophet and ARIMA are inherently
    different from all of the other algorithms in that, in order to train them, all

    it. Adding any other columns will restrict AutoML from using these algorithms.
