    we can design and develop systems that use data from other systems. We can also
    use data that does not really originate from people; for example, we can use data
    about defects or complexity of systems. However, to provide more value to society,
    we need to use data that contains information about people or their belongings;

    guidelines for ethical research in information and communication technology, including
    software engineering. They define four principles (quoted after the report):'

    autonomy, who are incapable of deciding for themselves, are entitled to protection.'

    fair, and burdens should be allocated equitably across impacted subjects.'

- en: The report encourages researchers and engineers to make a stakeholder identification
    and an identification of their perspectives and considerations. One of these considerations
    is the presence of malicious actors who can abuse the results of our work and/or
    harm the individuals whose data we analyze. We must always protect the people
    whose data we analyze and ensure that we do not cause them any harm. The same
    applies to the organizations we work with.

    data is the **General Data Protection Regulation** (**GDPR**) ([https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679)).
    It regulates the scope of handling personal data and puts requirements on the
    organization to obtain permission to collect, process, and use personal data,
    as well as requiring organizations to provide individuals with the ability to
    revoke permissions. The regulation is the most restrictive international regulation
    that is meant to protect individuals (us) from being abused by companies that
    have the means and abilities to collect and process data about us.

    repositories where we also store the data. One of them is Zenodo, which is used
    increasingly often to store datasets. Its terms of use require us to obtain the
    right permissions. Here are its terms of use ([https://about.zenodo.org/terms/):](https://about.zenodo.org/terms/):)

    responsibility, so we should make sure that we do not do any harm by providing
    it open to everyone. If there is non-anonymized data, we should consider other
    types of storage; for example, storage that requires authentication or access
    control, hence my next best practice.

    to prevent malicious actors from accessing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although we may have permission to use personal, non-anonymized data, we should
    keep this kind of data behind authentication. We need to protect the individuals
    who are behind this data. We also need to use access control and monitoring in
    case we need to backtrack who accessed the data; for instance, when a mistake
    was made.

    is a lot of data available, we must make sure that we do our due diligence and
    find out which contracts and obligations apply to us.

- en: Licenses are one type of contract, but not the only one. Almost all universities
    put contracts and obligations on researchers. These may include the need to ask
    for permission from ethical review boards or the need to make data available for
    scrutiny from other researchers.

- en: Professional codes of conduct are another type of obligation; for example, the
    one from ACM ([https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)).
    These codes of conduct often stem from the Nuremberg Code and require us to ensure
    that our work is for the good of society.

- en: Finally, when working with commercial organizations, we may need to sign a so-called
    **non-disclosure agreement** (**NDA**). Such agreements are often required to
    ensure that we do not disclose information without prior permission. They are
    often mistaken for the need to conceal information, but in most cases, it means
    that we need to ensure that our reporting of proprietary information does not
    harm the organization. In most cases, we may need to ensure that our report is
    about general practices rather than a specific company. If we see deficiencies
    with our industrial partners, we need to discuss them with our industrial partners
    and help them to improve – because we need to work for the best of society.
