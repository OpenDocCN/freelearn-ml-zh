			<p>In this section, we will look at some of the alternatives to Feast, which include a few managed feature store offerings. We will also deep-dive into Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, which will help us compare Feast (a self-managed infrastructure) to a managed feature store. We will also run through ML best practices and, finally, an end-to-end ML use case with a managed feature store, which includes feature engineering, model training, and model inference, along with feature and model monitoring examples. </p>
			<p>This section comprises the following chapters:</p>
