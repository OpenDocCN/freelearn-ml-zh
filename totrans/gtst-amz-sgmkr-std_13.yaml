    learning** (**ML**) life cycle. It is just the beginning of an important topic:
    how do we make sure the model is performing as it is designed to and as expected
    in real life? Monitoring how the model performs in production, especially on data
    that the model has never seen before, is made easy with SageMaker Studio. You
    will learn how to set up model monitoring for models deployed in SageMaker, detect
    data drift and performance drift, and visualize results in SageMaker Studio, so
    that you can let the system detect the degradation of your ML model automatically.'

- en: An ML model in production needs to be carefully and continuously monitored for
    its performance. There is no guarantee that once the model is trained and evaluated,
    it will be performing at the same level in production as in the testing environment.
    Unlike a software application, where unit tests can be implemented to test out
    an application in all possible edge cases, it is rather hard to monitor and detect
    issues of an ML model. This is because ML models use probabilistic, statistical,
    and fuzzy logic to infer an outcome for each incoming data point, and the testing,
    meaning the model evaluation, is typically done without true prior knowledge of
    production data. The best a data scientist can do prior to production is to create
    training data from a sample that closely represents the real-world data, and evaluate
    the model with an out-of-sample strategy in order to get an unbiased idea of how
    the model would perform on unseen data. While in production, the incoming data
    is completely unseen by the model; how to evaluate live model performance, and
    how to take action on that evaluation, is a critical topic for the productionization
    of ML models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model performance can be monitored with two approaches. One that is more straightforward
    is to capture the ground truth for the unseen data and compare the prediction
    against the ground truth. The second approach is to compare the statistical distribution
    and characteristics of inference data against the training data as a proxy to
    determine whether the model is behaving in an expected way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first approach requires ground-truth determination after the prediction
    event takes place so that we can directly compute the same performance metrics
    that data scientists would use during model evaluation. However, in some use cases,
    a true outcome (ground truth) may lag behind the event by a long time or may even
    not be available at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second approach lies in the premise that an ML model learns statistically
    and probabilistically from the training data and would behave differently when
    a new dataset from a different statistical distribution is provided. A model would
    return gibberish when data does not come from the same statistical distribution.
    This is called **covariate drift**. Therefore, detecting the covariate drift in
    data gives a more real-time estimate of how the model is going to perform.

- en: In this chapter, we focused on data drift and model drift in ML and how to monitor
    them using SageMaker Model Monitor and SageMaker Studio. We demonstrated how we
    set up a data quality monitor and a model quality monitor in SageMaker Studio
    to continuously monitor the behavior of a model and the characteristics of the
    incoming data, in a scenario where a regression model is deployed in a SageMaker
    endpoint and continuous inference traffic is hitting the endpoint. We introduced
    some random perturbation to the inference traffic and used SageMaker Model Monitor
    to detect unwanted behavior of the model and data. With this example, you can
    also deploy SageMaker Model Monitor to your use case and provide visibility and
    a guardrail to your models in production.

    with SageMaker Projects, Pipelines, and the model registry. We will be talking
    about an important trend in ML right now, that is, **continuous integration/continuous
    delivery** (**CI/CD**) and **ML operations** (**MLOps**). We will demonstrate
    how you can use SageMaker features, such as Projects, Pipelines, and the model
    registry, to make your ML project repeatable, reliable, and reusable, and have
    strong governance.
