    Attrition Using Ensemble Models*, covers the creation of powerful ML models through
    ensemble learning. The project covered in this chapter is from the human resources
    domain. Retention of talented employees is a key challenge faced by corporations.
    If we were able to predict the attrition of an employee well in advance, it is
    possible that the human resources or management team could do something to save
    the potential attrition from becoming real. It just so happens that it is possible
    to predict employee attrition through the application of ML. This chapter makes
    use of an IBM-curated public dataset that provides a pseudo employee attrition
    population and characteristics. We start the chapter with an introduction to the
    problem at hand and then attempt to explore the dataset with **exploratory data
    analysis** (**EDA**). The next step is the preprocessing phase, which includes
    the creation of new features using prior domain experience. Once the dataset is
    fully prepared, models will be created using multiple ensemble techniques, such
    as bagging, boosting , stacking, and randomization. Lastly, we will deploy the
    finally selected model for production. We will also learn about the concepts underlying
    the various ensemble techniques used to create the models.'

    Recommendation Engine*, introduces recommendation engines, which are designed
    to predict the ratings that a user would give to content such as movies and music.
    Based on what a user has previously liked or seen and using other profiling attributes,
    a recommendation engine suggests new content that the user might like. Such engines
    have gained a lot of significance in recent years. We explore the exciting area
    of recommendation systems by working on a joke recommendation engine project. In
    this chapter, we start by understanding the concepts and types of collaborative
    filtering algorithms. We will then build a recommendation engine to provide personalized
    joke recommendations using collaborative filtering approaches such as user-based
    collaborative filters and item-based collaborative filters. The dataset used for
    this project is a open dataset called the Jester jokes dataset. Apart from this,
    we will be exploring various libraries available in R that can be used to build
    recommendation systems, and we will be comparing the performances obtained from
    these approaches. Additionally, we leverage the market basket analysis technique,
    a pretty popular technique in the marketing domain, to discern relationships between
    various jokes.'

    of Amazon Reviews with NLP*, covers sentiment analysis, which entails finding
    the sentiment of a sentence and labeling it as positive, negative, or neutral.
    This chapter introduces sentiment analysis and covers the various techniques that
    can be used to analyze text. We will understand text-mining concepts and the various
    ways that text is labeled based on the tone.'

    contains millions of Amazon customer reviews and star ratings. It is a classification
    task where we will be categorizing each review as positive, negative, or neutral
    depending on the tone. Apart from using various popular R text-mining libraries
    to preprocess the reviews to be classified, we will also be leveraging a wide
    range of text representations, such as bag of words, word2vec, fastText, and Glove.
    Each of the text representations is then used as input for ML algorithms to perform
    classification. In the course of implementing each of these techniques, we will
    also learn about the concepts behind these techniques and also explore other instances
    where we could successfully apply them.

    Using Wholesale Data*, covers the segmentation, grouping, or clustering of customers,
    which can be achieved through unsupervised learning. We explore the various aspects
    of customer grouping in this chapter. Customer segmentation is an important tool
    used by product sellers to understand their customers and gather information.
    Customers can be segmented based on different criteria, such as age and spending
    patterns. In this chapter, we learn the various techniques of customer segmentation.
    For the project, we use a dataset containing wholesale transactions. This dataset
    is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We will be applying advanced
    clustering techniques, such as k-means, DIANA, and AGNES. At times, we will not
    know the number of groups that exist in the dataset at hand. We will explore the
    ML techniques for dealing with such ambiguity and have ML find out the number
    of groups possible based on the underlying characteristics of the input data.
    Evaluating the output of the clustering algorithms is an area that is often challenging
    to practitioners. We also explore this area so as to have a well-rounded understanding
    of applying clustering algorithms to real-world problems.'

    Using Deep Neural Networks*, covers **c****onvolutional neural networks** (**CNNs**),
    which are a type of deep neural network and are popular in computer vision applications. In
    this chapter, we learn about the fundamental concepts underlying CNNs. We explore
    why CNNs work so well with computer vision problems such as object detection.
    We discuss the aspects of transfer learning and how it works in tandem with CNNs
    to solve computer vision problems. As elsewhere in the book, we''ll be going by
    the philosophy of learning by doing. We will learn about all of these concepts
    by applying a CNN in the building of a multi-class classification model on a popular
    open dataset called MNIST. The objective of the project is to classify given images
    of handwritten digits. The project explores the methodology for creating features
    from raw images. We will learn about the various preprocessing techniques that
    can be applied to the image data in order use the data with deep learning models.'

    Detection Using Autoencoders*, covers autoencoders, which are yet another type
    of unsupervised deep learning network. We start the chapter by understanding autoencoders
    and how they are different from the other deep learning networks, such as **recurrent
    neural networks** (**RNNs**)and CNNs. We will learn about autoencoders by implementing
    a project that identifies credit card fraud. Credit card companies are constantly
    seeking ways to detect credit card fraud. Fraud detection is a key aspect for
    banks to protect their revenues. It can be achieved through the application of
    ML in the finance domain for the specific fraud detection problem. A fraud is
    usually an anomalous event that requires immediate action. In this chapter, we
    will use an autoencoder to detect fraud. Autoencoders are neural networks that
    contain a bottleneck layer whose dimensionality is smaller than the input data.
    In this chapter, we will become familiar with dimensionality reduction and how
    it can be used to identify credit card fraud detection. For the project, we will
    be using the H2O deep learning framework in tandem with R. As far as the dataset
    is concerned, we use an open dataset that contains credit card transactions of
    European card holders from September 2013\. There are a total of 284,807 transactions,
    out of which 492 are fraudulent.'

    with Recurrent Neural Networks*, introduces some **deep neural networks** (**DNNs**)
    that have recently received a lot of attention. This is due to their success in
    obtaining great results in various areas of ML, from face recognition and object
    detection to music generation and neural art. This chapter introduces the concepts
    necessary for understanding deep learning. We discuss the nuts and bolts of neural
    networks, such as neurons, hidden layers, various activation functions, techniques
    for dealing with problems faced in neural networks, and using optimization algorithms
    to get weights in neural networks. We will also implement a neural network from
    scratch to demonstrate these concepts. The content of this chapter will help us
    get foundational knowledge on neural networks. Then, we will learn how to apply
    an RNN by doing a project. It has always been thought that creative tasks such
    as authoring stories, writing poems, and painting pictures can only be achieved
    by humans. This is no longer true, thanks to deep learning! Technology can now
    accomplish creative tasks. We will create an application based on **long short-term
    memory** (**LSTM**) network, a variant of RNNs that generates text automatically.
    To accomplish this task, we make use of the MXNet framework, which extends its
    support for the R language to perform deep learning. In the course of implementing
    this project, we will also learn more about the concepts surrounding RNNs and
    LSTMs.'
