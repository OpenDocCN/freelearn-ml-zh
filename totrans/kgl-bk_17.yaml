    in the previous chapter, we will now conclude our overview of how Kaggle can positively
    affect your career. This last chapter discusses the best ways to leverage all
    your efforts to find new professional opportunities. We expect you now have all
    the previously described instruments (your Kaggle Discussions, Notebooks, and
    Datasets, and a GitHub account presenting quite a few projects derived from Kaggle),
    so this chapter will move to softer aspects: how to network and how to present

    contacted about new job opportunities that do not appear on public boards to having
    someone to rely on for data science problems you are not an expert in. Networking
    on Kaggle is principally related to team collaboration during competitions and
    connections built during meetups and other events organized by Kagglers.

    is not a widely recognized source used by human resources and hiring managers
    for selecting candidates. Some companies do take your Kaggle rankings and achievements
    into good consideration, but that’s a special case, not the general rule. Typically,
    you should expect your Kaggle experience to be ignored or sometimes even criticized.
    Our experience tells us, however, that what you learn and practice on Kaggle is
    highly valuable and it can be promoted by showcasing your coding and modeling
    efforts, and also by being able to talk about your experiences working alone or
    in a team.

    become a place where you can connect with other data scientists, collaborate,
    and make friends. In the past, competitions did not give rise to many exchanges
    on forums, and teams were heavily penalized in the global rankings because competition
    points were split equally among the team members. Improved rankings (see [https://www.kaggle.com/general/14196](https://www.kaggle.com/general/14196))
    helped many Kagglers see teaming up in a more favorable light.

    in data analysis and machine learning modeling. Kaggle itself offered a job board
    among the discussion forums and many recruiters roamed the leaderboard looking
    for profiles to contact. Companies themselves held contests explicitly to find
    candidates (Facebook, Intel, and Yelp arranged recruiting competitions for this
    purpose) or conveniently pick up the best competitors after seeing them perform
    excellently on certain kinds of problems (such as the insurance company AXA did
    after its telematics competitions). The peak of all this was marked by a Wired
    interview with *Gilberto Titericz*, where it was stated that “*highly ranked solvers
    are flooded with job offers*” ([https://www.wired.com/story/solve-these-tough-data-problems-and-watch-job-offers-roll-in/](https://www.wired.com/story/solve-these-tough-data-problems-and-watch-job-offers-roll-in/)).

    can act as **differentiators**. Recruiters and companies may use Kaggle rankings
    to make lists of potential candidates. The two most noticed rankings are in Competitions
    and Notebooks (hence, they also have the more intense competition and larger numbers
    of Grandmasters out of the four ranked areas), but sometimes they also watch the
    rankings for a *specific* competition. When certain rare competencies (for instance,
    in NLP or computer vision) are sought after, it is easier to find them in competitions
    that require you to use them skillfully in order to be successful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to show how you solved problems, how you coded solutions, and how you interacted
    and collaborated with teammates. On these occasions, more than the ranking or
    medal you got from Kaggle, it is important to talk about the specifics of the
    Kaggle competition, such as the industry it referred to, the type of data you
    had to deal with and why it interested you, and also to present your actions during
    the competition using the **STAR approach**, often used in job interviews.

    aims to have you talk more about behaviors than techniques, thus putting more
    emphasis on your capacities than the capabilities of the algorithm you have chosen;
    anyone else could have used the same algorithm, but it was you who managed to
    use it so successfully.

    be enough to impress your interviewer, reformulating your successful experience
    in a Kaggle competition is paramount. The approach can work either when you have
    competed solo or in a team; in the latter case, an important aspect to describe
    is how you interacted with and positively influenced the other teammates. Let’s
    discuss some ways you could do that.
  prefs: []

    be in the initial phases, in the experimentation phases, or in the final wrap-up.

    your value proposition in front of the interviewer.

    your career prospects. We have touched on building connections, both by teaming
    up on competitions and participating in events related to past competitions, and
    also on using your Kaggle experience in order to find a new job. We have discussed
    how, based on our experience and the experience of other Kagglers, results on
    Kaggle alone cannot ensure that you get a position. However, they can help you
    get attention from recruiters and human resource departments and then reinforce
    how you present competencies in data science (if they are supported by a carefully-built
    portfolio, as we described in the previous chapter).

    dispersed across hundreds of competitions and thousands of Notebooks, discussions,

    anyone starting off on Kaggle. We compiled what we think is essential, indispensable
    knowledge to guide you through all the competitions you may want to take part
    in. That is why this has not been a book on data science in a strict sense, but
    a book specifically on data science on Kaggle.

    over ten years, we have always found a way to turn our experiences on Kaggle into
    positive ones. You can re-read this work as a book that describes our endless
    journey through the world of data science competitions. A journey on Kaggle does
    not end when you get all the Grandmaster titles and rank first worldwide. It actually
    never ends, because you can re-invent how you participate and leverage your experience
    in competitions in endless ways. As this book ends, so your journey on Kaggle
    starts, and we wish for you a long, rich, and fruitful experience – as it has
    been for us. Have a great journey!
