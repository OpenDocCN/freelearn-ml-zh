    a book that aims to introduce you to the exciting world of making **machine learning**
    (**ML**) systems production-ready.

- en: In the two years since the first edition of this book was released, the world
    of ML has moved on substantially. There are now far more powerful modeling techniques
    available, more complex technology stacks, and a whole host of new frameworks
    and paradigms to keep up to date with. To help extract the signal from the noise,
    the second edition of this book covers a far larger variety of topics in more
    depth than the first edition, while still focusing on the critical tools and techniques
    you will need to build up your ML engineering expertise. This edition will cover
    the same core topics such as how to manage your ML projects, how to create your
    own high-quality Python ML packages, and how to build and deploy reusable training
    and monitoring pipelines, while adding discussion around more modern tooling.
    It will also showcase and dissect different deployment architectures in more depth
    and discuss more ways to scale your applications using AWS and cloud-agnostic
    tooling. This will all be done using a variety of the most popular and latest
    open-source packages and frameworks, from classics like **Scikit-Learn** and **Apache
    Spark** to **Kubeflow**, **Ray**,and **ZenML**. Excitingly, this edition also
    has new sections dedicated entirely to Transformers and **Large Language Models**
    (**LLMs**) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, including examples using Hugging Face and OpenAI
    APIs to fine-tune and build pipelines using these extraordinary new models. As
    in the first edition, the focus is on equipping you with the solid foundation
    you need to go far deeper into each of these components of ML engineering. The
    aim is that by the end of this book, you will be able to confidently build, scale,
    and deploy production-grade ML systems in Python using these latest tools and
    concepts.

    foundation you can build on. In covering the key principles, the aim is that you
    come away from this book feeling more confident in tackling your own ML engineering
    challenges, whatever your chosen toolset.

    years have led to a proliferation of job roles and responsibilities. The debate
    that once raged over how a *data scientist* was different from a *statistician*
    has now become extremely complex. I would argue, however, that it does not have
    to be so complicated. The activities that have to be undertaken to get value from
    data are pretty consistent, no matter what business vertical you are in, so it
    should be reasonable to expect that the skills and roles you need to perform these
    steps will also be relatively consistent. In this chapter, we will explore some
    of the main data disciplines that I think you will always need in any data project.
    As you can guess, given the name of this book, I will be particularly keen to
    explore the notion of *ML engineering* and how this fits into the mix.

    this job role became one of the most sought after, but also hyped, in the mix.
    Its popularity remains high, but the challenges of taking advanced analytics and

    I often refer to in talks as “the chasm,” has led to the rise of what I would
    now argue is one of the most important roles in technology. The ML engineer serves
    an acute need to translate the world of data science modeling and exploration
    into the world of software products and systems engineering. Since this is no
    easy feat, the ML engineer has become increasingly sought after and is now a critical
    piece of the data-driven software value chain. If you cannot get things into production,
    you are not generating value, and if you are not generating value, well we know
    that’s not great!

    a classic voice assistant. In this case, a data scientist would usually focus
    on translating the business requirements into a working *speech-to-text* model,
    potentially a very complex neural network, and showing that it can perform the
    desired voice transcription task *in principle*. ML engineering is then all about
    how you take that speech-to-text model and build it into a product, service, or
    tool that can be used *in production*. Here, it may mean building some software
    to train, retrain, deploy, and track the performance of the model as more transcription
    data is accumulated, or as user preferences are understood. It may also involve
    understanding how to interface with other systems and provide results from the
    model in the appropriate formats. For example, the results of the model may need
    to be packaged into a JSON object and sent via a REST API call to an online supermarket,
    in order to fulfill an order.

    now emerging with the aim of enabling ML engineers to do their work with higher
    quality, at greater pace, and at a larger scale. These are the **Machine Learning
    Operations** (**MLOps**) engineers. This role is all about building out the tools
    and capabilities that enable the tasks of the ML engineer and data scientists.
    This role focuses more on building out the tooling, platforms, and automation
    used by the other roles, and so connects them nicely. That is not to say MLOps
    engineers will not be used in specific projects or builds; it is just that their
    main value-add comes not from this but from enabling the capabilities used during
    a specific project or build. If we revisit the example of the speech-to-text solution
    described in the *ML engineer* section, we can get a flavor of this. Where the
    ML engineer will be worried about building out a solution that works seamlessly
    in production, the MLOps engineer will work hard to build out the platform or
    toolset that the ML engineer uses to do this. The ML engineer will build pipelines,
    but the MLOps engineer may build pipeline templates; the ML engineer may use **continuous
    integration/continuous deployment** (**CI/CD**) practices (more on this later),
    but the MLOps engineer will enable that capability and define the best practice
    to use CI/CD smoothly. Finally, where the ML engineer thinks “How do I solve this
    specific problem robustly using the proper tools and techniques?”, the MLOps engineer
    asks “How do I make sure that the ML engineers and data scientists will be able
    to, in general, solve the types of problems they need to, and how can I continually
    update and improve that setup?”

- en: Third, *tie your team structure to your projects in a dynamic way*. If you work
    on a project that is mostly about getting the data in the right place and the
    actual ML models are really simple, focus your team profile on the engineering
    and data modeling aspects. If the project requires a detailed understanding of
    the model, and it is quite complex, then reposition your team to make sure this
    is covered. This is just sensible and frees up team members who would otherwise
    have been underutilized to work on other projects.

    can be calculated and defined in a variety of ways, but fundamentally your work
    has to improve something for the company or its customers in a way that justifies
    the investment put in. This is why most companies will not be happy for you to
    take a year to play with new tools and then generate nothing concrete to show
    for it, or to spend your days only reading the latest papers. Yes, these things
    are part of any job in technology, and they can definitely be super-fun, but you

    an appropriate handover of the results. Due to security and reliability concerns,
    it is not a good idea to write to the production database directly. You, therefore,

    every store can quickly lead to hundreds or even thousands of models if the chain
    gathers enough data. Another issue is that not all stores are on the resource
    planning system used at the company yet, so some planners would like to retrieve
    forecasts for other stores they know are similar to their own. It is agreed that
    if users like this can explore regional profiles they believe are similar to their
    own data, then they can still make the optimal decisions.

    rule out a full batch process. This wouldn’t cover the use case for regions not
    on the core system and wouldn’t allow for dynamic retrieval of up-to-date forecasts
    via the website, which would allow you to deploy models that forecast at a variety
    of time horizons in the future. It also means you could save on compute as you
    don’t need to manage the storage and updating of thousands of forecasts every
    day and your resources can be focused on model training.

    can return forecasts as needed by the user makes the most sense. To give efficient
    responses, you have to consider what happens in a typical user session. By workshopping
    with the potential users of the dashboard, you quickly realize that although the
    requests are dynamic, most planners will focus on particular items of interest
    in any one session. They will also not look at many regions. You then decide that
    it makes sense to have a caching strategy, where you take certain requests that
    you think might be common and cache them for reuse in the application.

    uses the site less frequently, we may want to entice them with more aggressive
    discounts. One of the key requirements from the business is that the end results

    engineers focus their efforts on building the ingestion and data store infrastructure,

    team has trained on historical data. The base algorithm that the data scientists

- en: The example above highlights the basic components of creating a typical classification
    model, but the question we have to ask ourselves as engineers is, “Then what?”
    It is clear that we have to actually run predictions with the model that has been
    produced, so we’ll need to persist it somewhere and read it in later. This is
    similar to the other use cases discussed in this chapter. Where things are more
    challenging here is that in this case, the engineers may actually consider not
    running in a batch or request-response scenario but in a streaming context. This
    means we will have to consider new technologies like **Apache Kafka** that enable
    you to both publish and subscribe to “topics” where packets of data called “events”
    can be shared. Not only that, but we will also have to make decisions about how
    to interact with data in this way using an ML model, raising questions about the
    appropriate model hosting mechanism. There will also be some subtleties around
    how often you want to retrain your algorithm to make sure that the classifier
    does not go stale. This is before we consider questions of latency or of monitoring
    the model’s performance in this very different setting. As you can see, this means
    that the ML engineer’s job here is quite a complex one. *Figure 1.8* subsumes
    all this complexity into a very high-level diagram that would allow you to start
    considering the sort of system interactions you would need to build if you were
    the engineer on this project.

    within a modern team building valuable solutions based on data. There was a discussion
    of how the focus of ML engineering is complementary to the strengths of data science
    and data engineering and where these disciplines overlap. Some comments were made
    about how to use this information to assemble an appropriately resourced team

    engineering encompasses, while giving you some of the conceptual tools to start
    reasoning about those challenges. My hope is that this not only motivates you
    to engage with the material in the rest of this edition, but it also sets you
    down the path of exploration and self-study that will be required to have a successful
