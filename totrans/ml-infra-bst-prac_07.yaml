- en: Machine learning software depends on data much more than other types of software.
    In order to make use of statistical learning, we need to collect, process, and
    prepare data for the development of machine learning models. The data needs to
    be representative of the problems that the software solves and the services it
    provides, not only during development but also during operations. In this part
    of the book, we focus on the data â€“ how we can acquire it and how we make it useful
    for the training, testing, and deployment of machine learning models.
