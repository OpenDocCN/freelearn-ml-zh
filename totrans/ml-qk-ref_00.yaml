- en: Machine learning involves developing and training models to predict future outcomes.
    This book is a practical guide to all the tips and tricks related to machine learning.
    It includes hands-on, easy-to-access techniques on topics such as model selection,
    performance tuning, training neural networks, time series analysis, and a lot
    more.

    concepts behind machine learning algorithms, but also the mathematics behind them.
    However, we have tried to strike a balance between these two.

- en: If you're a machine learning practitioner, data scientist, machine learning
    developer, or engineer, this book will serve as a reference point for building
    machine learning solutions. You will also find this book useful if you're an intermediate
    machine learning developer or data scientist looking for a quick, handy reference
    to all the concepts of machine learning. You'll need some exposure to machine
    learning to get the best out of this book.

- en: '[Chapter 1](f5717643-7339-46dd-aad1-9277e0091279.xhtml), *Quantification of
    Learning*, builds the foundation for later chapters. First, we are going to understand
    the meaning of a statistical model. We''ll also discuss the thoughts of Leo Breiman
    about statistical modeling. Later, we will discuss curves and why they are so
    important. One of the typical ways to find out the association between variables
    and modeling is curve fitting, which is introduced in this chapter.'

- en: To build a model, one of the steps is to partition the data. We will discuss
    the reasoning behind this and examine an approach to carry it out. While we are
    building a model, more often that not it is not a smooth ride, and we run into
    several issues. We often encounter overfitting and underfitting, for several reasons.
    We need to understand why and learn how to overcome it. Also, we will be discussing
    how overfitting and underfitting are connected to bias and variance. This chapter
    will discuss these concepts with respect to neural networks. Regularization is
    one of the hyperparameters that is an integral part of the model building process.
    We will understand why it is required. Cross-validation, model selection, and
    0.632+ bootstrap will be talked about in this chapter, as they help data scientists
    to fine-tune a model.

    Learning*, explains how **support vector machines** (**SVMs**) have been among
    the most sophisticated models and have grabbed a lot of attention in the areas
    of classification and regression. But practitioners still find them difficult
    to grasp as it involve lots of mathematics. However, we have tried to keep it
    simple and mathematical too, so that you should be able to understand the tricks
    of SVMs. Also, we''ll look at the kernel trick, which took SVMs to another level
    by making computation simple, to an extent. We will study the different types
    of kernel and their usage.'

    Learning*, explains how to build models based on the concepts of bagging and boosting,
    which are ruling the world of hackathons. We will discuss bagging and boosting
    in detail. They have led to the creation of many good algorithms, such as random
    forest and gradient boosting. We will discuss each in detail with the help of
    a use case so that you can understand the difference between these two. Also,
    an important part of this chapter deals with the optimization of hyperparameters.'

    covers neural networks, which have always been deemed black box algorithms that
    take lots of effort to understand. We have tried to unbox the complexities surrounding
    NNs. We have started with detailing how NNs are analogous to the human brain.
    This chapter also covers what parameters such as weights and biases are and how
    an NN learns. An NN''s learning process involves network initialization, a feedforward
    system, and cost calculation. Once a cost is calculated, backpropagation kicks
    off.'

    gradients, and overfitting. This chapter encompasses all such problems, helps
    us understand why such challenges occur, and explains how to overcome them.

    covers different time series models for analyzing demand forecasting, be it stock
    price or sales forecasting, or anything else. Almost every industry runs into
    such use cases. In order to carry out such use cases, there are multiple approaches,
    and what we have covered is autoregressive models, ARMA, ARIMA, and others. We
    have started with the concepts of autoregression. Then comes stationarity, which
    is an important element of such models. This chapter examines stationarity and
    how we can detect it. Also, assessment of the model is covered too. Anomaly detection
    in econometrics is also discussed at length with the help of a use case.'

    Processing*, explains what natural language processing is making textual data
    talk. There are a number of algorithms that make this work. We cannot work with
    textual data as it is. It needs to be vectorized and embedded. This chapter covers
    various ways of doing this, such as TF-IDF and bag-of-words methods.'

    such approaches, and compare the results of different methods. We then move on
    to topic modeling, wherein the prime motive is to extract the the main topics
    from a corpus. And later, we will examine a use case and solve it with a Bayesian
    approach.

    analytics to deep learning, we have lots to catch up on. This chapter explores
    weight initialization, layer formation, the calculation of cost, and backpropagation.

    it works.'

    discusses algorithms that provide a directional view around causality in a time
    series. Our stakeholders often mention the causality behind the target variable. So,
    we have addressed it using the Granger causality model in time series, and we
    have also discussed Bayesian techniques that enable us to achieve causality.'

    explains that there are number of state-of-the-art models in the pipeline, and
    they need a special mention in this book. This chapter should help you understand
    and apply them. Also, we have talked about independent component analysis and
    how it is different from principal component analysis. Subsequently, we discuss
    the Bayesian technique of multiple imputation and its importance. We will also
    get an understanding of self-organizing maps and why they are important. Lastly,
    we will also touch upon compressed sensing.'
