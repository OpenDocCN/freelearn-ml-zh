    <h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-14">Introducing Machine Learning</h1>
    <p class="normal">If science-fiction stories are to be believed, the invention of artificial intelligence inevitably leads to apocalyptic wars between machines and their makers. The stories begin with today’s reality: computers being taught to play simple games like tic-tac-toe and to automate routine tasks. As the stories go, machines are later given control of traffic lights and communications, followed by military drones and missiles. The machines’ evolution takes an ominous turn once the computers become sentient and learn how to teach themselves. Having no more need for human programmers, humankind is then “deleted.”</p>
    <p class="normal">Thankfully, at the time of writing, machines still require user input.</p>
    <p class="normal">Though your impressions of machine learning may be colored by these mass-media depictions, today’s algorithms have little danger of becoming self-aware. The goal of today’s machine learning is not to create an artificial brain, but rather to assist us with making sense of and acting on the world’s rapidly accumulating data stores.</p>
    <p class="normal">Putting popular misconceptions aside, by the end of this chapter, you will gain a more nuanced understanding of machine learning. You will also be introduced to the fundamental concepts that define and differentiate the most common machine learning approaches. You will learn: </p>

      <li class="bulletList">How computers transform data into knowledge and action</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The steps needed to match a machine learning algorithm with your data</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The field of machine learning provides a set of algorithms that transform data into actionable knowledge. Keep reading to see how easy it is to use R to start applying machine learning to real-world problems.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-15">The origins of machine learning</h1>
    <p class="normal">Beginning<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> at birth, we are inundated with data. Our body’s sensors—the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and nerves—are continually assailed with raw data that our brain translates into sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. Using language, we can share these experiences with others.</p>
    <p class="normal">Since the advent of written language, humans have recorded their observations. Hunters monitored the movement of animal herds; early astronomers recorded the alignment of planets and stars; and cities recorded tax payments, births, and deaths. Today, such observations, and many more, are increasingly automated and recorded systematically in ever-growing computerized databases.</p>
    <p class="normal">The invention of electronic sensors has additionally contributed to an explosion in the volume and richness of recorded data. Specialized sensors, such as cameras, microphones, chemical noses, electronic tongues, and pressure sensors mimic the human ability to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. These sensors process the data far differently than a human being would. Unlike a human’s limited and subjective attention, an electronic sensor never takes a break and has no emotions to skew its perception.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Although sensors are not clouded by subjectivity, they do not necessarily report a single, definitive depiction of reality. Some have an inherent measurement error due to hardware limitations. Others are limited by their scope. A black-and-white photograph provides a different depiction of its subject than one shot in color. Similarly, a microscope provides a far different depiction of reality than a telescope.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Between databases and sensors, many aspects of our lives are recorded. Governments, businesses, and individuals are recording and reporting information, from the monumental to the mundane. Weather sensors obtain temperature and pressure data; surveillance cameras watch sidewalks and subway tunnels; and all manner of electronic behaviors are monitored: transactions, communications, social media relationships, and many others.</p>
    <p class="normal">This deluge of data has led some to state that we have entered an <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>era of <strong class="keyWord">big data</strong>, but this may be a bit of a misnomer. Human beings have always been surrounded by large amounts of data—one would need only to look to the sky and attempt to count its stars to discover a virtually endless supply. What makes the current era unique is that we have vast amounts of <em class="italic">recorded</em> data, much of which can be directly accessed by computers. Larger and more interesting datasets are increasingly accessible at the tips of our fingers, only a web search away. This wealth of information has the potential to inform action, given a systematic way of making sense of it all.</p>
    <p class="normal">The field of study dedicated to the development of computer algorithms for transforming data into intelligent action is <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>known as <strong class="keyWord">machine learning</strong>. This field originated in an environment where the available data, statistical methods, and computing power rapidly and simultaneously evolved. Growth in the volume of data necessitated <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>additional computing power, which in turn spurred the development of statistical methods for analyzing large datasets. This created a cycle of advancement, allowing even larger and more interesting data to be collected, and enabled today’s environment in which endless streams of data are available on virtually any topic.</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.1: The cycle of advancement that enabled machine learning </p>
    <p class="normal">A closely related sibling of machine<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> learning, <strong class="keyWord">data mining</strong>, is concerned with the generation of novel insight from large databases. As the term implies, data mining involves a systematic hunt for nuggets of actionable intelligence. Although there is some disagreement over how widely machine learning and data mining overlap, one point of distinction is that machine learning focuses on teaching computers how to use data to solve a problem, while data mining focuses on teaching computers to identify patterns that humans then use to solve a problem.</p>
    <p class="normal">Virtually all data mining involves the use of machine learning, but not all machine learning requires data mining. For example, you might apply machine learning to data mine automobile traffic data for patterns related to accident rates. On the other hand, if the computer is learning how to identify<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> traffic signs, this is purely machine learning without data mining.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">The phrase “data mining” is also sometimes used as a pejorative to describe the deceptive practice of cherry-picking data to support a theory.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Machine learning is also<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> intertwined with the field of <strong class="keyWord">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AI</strong>), which<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> is a nebulous discipline and, depending on whom you might ask, is simply machine learning with a strong marketing spin or a distinct field of study altogether. A cynic might suggest that the field of AI tends to exaggerate its importance such as by calling a simple predictive model an “AI bot,” while an AI proponent may point out that the field tends to tackle the most challenging learning tasks while aiming for human-level performance. The truth is somewhere in between.</p>
    <p class="normal">Just as machine learning itself depends on statistical methods, artificial intelligence depends a great deal on machine learning, but the business contexts and applications tend to differ. The table that follows highlights some differentiators among traditional statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence; however, keep in mind that the lines between the three disciplines are often less rigid than they may appear.</p>

    <p class="normal">In this formulation, machine learning<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> sits firmly at the intersection of human and computer partnership, whereas traditional statistics relies primarily on the human to drive insights and AI seeks to minimize human involvement as much as possible. Learning how to maximize the human-machine partnership and apply learning algorithms to real-world problems is the focus of this book. Understanding the use cases and limitations of machine learning is an important starting point in this journey.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-16">Uses and abuses of machine learning</h1>
    <p class="normal">Most people have heard of Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer that in 1997 was the first to win a game against a world champion. Another famous computer, Watson, defeated two human opponents on the television trivia game show <em class="italic">Jeopardy</em> in 2011. Based on these stunning accomplishments, some have speculated that computer intelligence will replace workers in information technology occupations, just as automobiles replaced horses and machines replaced workers in fields and assembly lines. Recently, these fears have become more pronounced as artificial intelligence-based algorithms, such as GPT-3 and DALL·E 2 from the OpenAI<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> research group (<a href="https://openai.com/"><span class="url">https://openai.com/</span></a>), have reached impressive milestones and are proving that computers are capable of writing text and creating artwork that is virtually indistinguishable from that produced by humans. Ultimately, this may lead to massive shifts in occupations like marketing, customer support, illustration, and so on, as creativity is outsourced to machines that can produce endless streams of material more cheaply than the former employees.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this case, humans may still be necessary because the truth is that even as machines reach such impressive milestones, they are still relatively limited in their ability to thoroughly understand a problem, or understand how the work is going to be applied toward a real-world goal. Learning algorithms are pure intellectual horsepower without direction. A computer may be more capable than a human of finding subtle patterns in large databases, but it still needs a human to motivate the analysis and turn the result into meaningful action. In most cases, the human will determine whether the machine’s output is valuable and will help the machine avoid creating a limitless supply of nonsense.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Without completely discounting the achievements of Deep Blue and Watson, it is important to note that neither is even as intelligent as a typical five-year-old. For more on why “comparing smarts is a slippery business,” see the <em class="italic">Popular Science</em> article FYI, <em class="italic">Which Computer Is Smarter, Watson Or Deep Blue?</em>, by Will Grunewald, 2012: <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-12/fyi-which-computer-smarter-watson-or-deep-blue"><span class="url">https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-12/fyi-which-computer-smarter-watson-or-deep-blue</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Machines are not good at asking questions or even knowing what questions to ask. They are much better at answering them, provided the question is stated in a way that the computer can comprehend. Present-day machine learning algorithms partner with people much like a bloodhound works with its trainer: the dog’s sense of smell may be many times stronger than its master’s, but without being carefully directed, the hound may end up chasing its tail.</p>

    <p class="normal">In the worst-case scenario, if machine learning were implemented carelessly, it might lead to what controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk provocatively called “summoning the demon.” This perspective suggests that we may be unleashing forces outside our control, despite the hubristic sense that we will be able to reign them in when needed. Given the power of artificial intelligence to automate processes and react to changing conditions much faster and more objectively than humans, there may come a point at which Pandora’s box has been opened and it is difficult or impossible to return to the old ways of life where humans are in control. As Musk describes:</p>
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">
      <p class="quote">”If AI has a goal and humanity just happens to be in the way, it will destroy humanity as a matter of course without even thinking about it. No hard feelings… It’s just like, if we’re building a road and an anthill just happens to be in the way, we don’t hate ants, we’re just building a road, and so, goodbye anthill.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="normal">While this may seem to be a bleak portrayal, it is still the realm of far-future science fiction, as you will soon learn when reading about the present day’s state-of-the-art machine learning successes. </p>
    <p class="normal">However, Musk’s warning does help emphasize the importance of understanding the likelihood of machine learning and AI being a double-edged sword. For all of its benefits, there are some places where it still has room for improvement, and some situations where it may do more harm than good. If machine learning practitioners cannot be trusted to act ethically, it may be necessary for governments to intervene to prevent the greatest harm to society.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">For more on Musk’s fears of “summoning the demon” see the following 2018 article from CNBC: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/elon-musk-warns-ai-could-create-immortal-dictator-in-documentary.html"><span class="url">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/elon-musk-warns-ai-could-create-immortal-dictator-in-documentary.html</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-17">Machine learning successes</h2>
    <p class="normal">Machine learning is most successful when <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>it augments the specialized knowledge of a subject-matter expert rather than replacing the expert altogether. It works with medical doctors at the forefront of the fight to eradicate cancer; assists engineers with efforts to create smarter homes and automobiles; helps social scientists and economists build better societies; and provides business and marketing professionals with valuable insights. Toward these ends, it is employed in countless scientific laboratories, hospitals, companies, and governmental organizations. Any effort that generates or aggregates data likely employs at least one machine learning algorithm to help make sense of it.</p>
    <p class="normal">Though it is impossible to list every successful application of machine learning, a selection of prominent examples is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Identification of unwanted spam messages in email</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Segmentation of customer behavior for targeted advertising</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Forecasts of weather behavior and long-term climate changes</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Preemptive interventions for customers likely to churn (stop purchasing)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Reduction of fraudulent credit card transactions</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Actuarial estimates of financial damage from storms and natural disasters</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Prediction of and influence over election outcomes</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Development of algorithms for auto-piloting drones and self-driving cars</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Optimization of energy use in homes and office buildings</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Projection of areas where criminal activity is most likely</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Discovery of <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>genetic sequences useful for precision medicine</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By the end of this book, you will understand the basic machine learning algorithms that are employed to teach computers to perform these tasks. For now, it suffices to say that no matter the context, the fundamental machine learning process is the same. In every task, an algorithm takes data and identifies patterns that form the basis for further action.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-18">The limits of machine learning</h2>
    <p class="normal">Although machine <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>learning is used widely and has tremendous potential, it is important to understand its limits. The algorithms used today—even those on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence—emulate a relatively limited subset of the capabilities of the human brain. They offer little flexibility to extrapolate outside of strict parameters and know no common sense. Considering this, one should be extremely careful to recognize exactly what an algorithm has learned before setting it loose in the real world.</p>
    <p class="normal">Without a lifetime of past experiences to build upon, computers are limited in their ability to make simple inferences about logical next steps. Consider the banner advertisements on websites, which are served according to patterns learned by data mining the browsing history of millions of users. Based on this data, someone who views websites selling mattresses is interested in buying a mattress and should therefore see advertisements for mattresses. The problem is that this becomes a never-ending cycle in which, even after a mattress has been purchased, additional mattress advertisements are shown, rather than advertisements for pillows and bed sheets.</p>
    <p class="normal">Many people are familiar with the deficiencies of machine learning’s ability to understand or translate language, or to recognize speech and handwriting. Perhaps the earliest example of this type of failure is in a 1994 episode of the television show <em class="italic">The Simpsons</em>, which showed a parody of the Apple Newton tablet. In its time, the Newton was known for its state-of-the-art handwriting recognition. Unfortunately for Apple, it would occasionally fail to great effect. The television episode illustrated this through a sequence in which a bully’s note to “Beat up Martin” was misinterpreted by the Newton as “Eat up Martha.”</p>
    <p class="normal"><img alt="Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated" src="../Images/B17290_01_03.png"/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: Screen captures from <em class="italic">Lisa on Ice, The Simpsons, 20th Century Fox</em> (1994)</p>
    <p class="normal">Machine language processing has improved enough in the time since the Apple Newton that Google, Apple, and Microsoft are all confident in their ability to offer voice-activated virtual concierge services, such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana. Still, these services routinely struggle to answer relatively simple questions. Furthermore, online translation services sometimes misinterpret sentences that a toddler would readily understand, and the predictive text feature on many devices has led to humorous “autocorrect fail” websites that illustrate computers’ ability to understand basic language but completely misunderstand context.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some of these mistakes are<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> to be expected. Language is complicated, with multiple layers of text and subtext, and even human beings sometimes misunderstand context. Although machine learning is rapidly improving at language processing, and current state-of-the-art algorithms like GPT-3 are quite good in comparison to prior generations, machines still make mistakes that are obvious to humans that know where to look. These predictable shortcomings illustrate the important fact that machine learning is only as good as the data it has learned from. If context is not explicit in the input data, then just like a human, the<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> computer will have to make its best guess from its set of past experiences. However, the computer’s past experiences are usually much more limited than the human’s.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-19">Machine learning ethics</h2>
    <p class="normal">At its core, machine learning <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>is simply a tool that assists us with making sense of the world’s complex data. Like any tool, it can be used for good or evil. Machine learning goes wrong mostly when it is applied so broadly, or so callously, that humans are treated as lab rats, automata, or mindless consumers. A process that may seem harmless can lead to unintended consequences when automated by an emotionless computer. For this reason, those using machine learning or data mining would be remiss not to at least briefly consider the ethical implications of the art.</p>
    <p class="normal">Due to the relative youth of machine learning as a discipline and the speed at which it is progressing, the associated legal issues and social norms are often quite uncertain, and constantly in flux. Caution should be exercised when obtaining or analyzing data in order to avoid breaking laws, violating terms of service or data use agreements, or abusing the trust or violating the privacy of customers or the public. The informal corporate motto of Google, an organization that collects perhaps more data on individuals than any other, was at one time, “don’t be evil.” While this seems clear enough, it may not be sufficient. A better approach may be to follow the <em class="italic">Hippocratic Oath</em>, a medical principle that states, “above all, do no harm.” Following the principle of “do no harm” may have helped avoid recent scandals at Facebook and other companies, such as the Cambridge Analytica controversy, which alleged that social media data was being used to manipulate elections.</p>
    <p class="normal">Retailers routinely use machine learning for advertising, targeted promotions, inventory management, or the layout of items in a store. Many have equipped checkout lanes with devices that print coupons for promotions based on a customer’s buying history. In exchange for a bit of personal data, the customer receives discounts on the specific products they want to buy. At first, this may appear relatively harmless, but consider what happens when this practice is taken a bit further.</p>
    <p class="normal">One possibly apocryphal tale concerns a large retailer in the United States that employed machine learning to identify expectant mothers for coupon mailings. The retailer hoped that if these mothers-to-be received substantial discounts, they would become loyal customers who would later purchase profitable items such as diapers, baby formula, and toys. Equipped with machine learning methods, the retailer identified items in the customer purchase history that could be used to predict with a high degree of certainty not only whether a woman was pregnant, but also the approximate timing for when the baby was due.</p>
    <p class="normal">After the retailer used this data for a promotional mailing, an angry man contacted the chain and demanded to know why his young daughter received coupons for maternity items. He was furious that the retailer seemed to be encouraging teenage pregnancy! As the story goes, when the retail chain called to offer an apology, it was the father who ultimately apologized after confronting his daughter and discovering that she was indeed pregnant!</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">For more detail on how retailers use machine learning to identify pregnancies, see the <em class="italic">New York Times Magazine</em> article titled <em class="italic">How Companies Learn Your Secrets</em>, by Charles Duhigg, 2012: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html"><span class="url">https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Whether the story was completely true or not, the lesson learned from the preceding tale is that common sense should be applied before blindly applying the results of a machine learning analysis. This is particularly true in cases where sensitive information, such as health data, is concerned. With a bit more care, the retailer could have foreseen this scenario and used greater discretion when choosing how to reveal the pregnancy status its machine learning analysis had discovered. Unfortunately, as history tends to repeat itself, social media companies have been under fire recently for targeting expectant mothers with advertisements for baby products even after these mothers experience the tragedy of a miscarriage.</p>
    <p class="normal">Because machine learning <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>algorithms are developed with historical data, computers may learn some unfortunate behaviors of human societies. Sadly, this sometimes includes perpetuating race or gender discrimination and reinforcing negative stereotypes. For example, researchers found that Google’s online advertising service was more likely to show ads for high-paying jobs to men than women and was more likely to display ads for criminal background checks to black people than white people. Although the machine may have correctly learned that men once held jobs that were not offered to most women, it is not desirable to have the algorithm perpetuate such injustices. Instead, it may be necessary to teach the machine to reflect society not as it currently is, but how it ought to be.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Sometimes, algorithms that are specifically designed with the intention of being “content-neutral” eventually come to reflect undesirable beliefs or ideologies. In one egregious case, a Twitter chatbot service developed by Microsoft was quickly taken offline after it began spreading Nazi and anti-feminist propaganda, which it may have learned from so-called “trolls” posting inflammatory content on internet forums and chat rooms. In another case, an algorithm created to reflect an objective conception of human beauty sparked controversy when it favored almost exclusively white people. Imagine the consequences if this had been applied to facial recognition software for criminal activity! </p>
      <p class="normal">For more information about the real-world consequences of machine learning and discrimination see the <em class="italic">Harvard Business Review</em> article <em class="italic">Addressing the Biases Plaguing Algorithms</em>, by Michael Li, 2019: <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/05/addressing-the-biases-plaguing-algorithms"><span class="url">https://hbr.org/2019/05/addressing-the-biases-plaguing-algorithms</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">To limit the ability of <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>algorithms to discriminate illegally, certain jurisdictions have well-intentioned laws that prevent the use of racial, ethnic, religious, or other protected class data for business reasons. However, excluding this data from a project may not be enough because machine learning algorithms can still inadvertently learn to discriminate. If a certain segment of people tends to live in a certain region, buys a certain product, or otherwise behaves in a way that uniquely identifies them as a group, machine learning algorithms can infer the protected information from other factors. In such cases, you may need to <em class="italic">completely</em> de-identify these people by excluding any <em class="italic">potentially</em> identifying data in addition to the already-protected statuses.</p>
    <p class="normal">In a recent example of this type of alleged algorithmic bias, the Apple credit card, which debuted in 2019, was almost immediately accused of providing substantially higher credit limits to men than to women—sometimes by 10 to 20 times the amount—even for spouses with joint assets and similar credit histories. Although Apple and the issuing bank, Goldman Sachs, denied that gender bias was at play and confirmed that no legally protected applicant characteristics were used in the algorithm, this did not slow speculation that perhaps some bias crept in unintentionally. It did not help matters that for competitive reasons, Apple and Goldman Sachs chose to keep the details of the algorithm secret, which led people to assume the worst. If the systematic bias allegations were untrue, being able to explain what was truly happening and exactly how the decisions were made might have alleviated much of the outrage. A potential worst-case scenario would have occurred if Apple and Goldman Sachs were investigated yet couldn’t explain the result to regulators, due to the algorithm’s complexity!</p>

    <p class="normal">Apart from the legal consequences, customers may feel uncomfortable or become upset if aspects of their lives they consider private are made public. The challenge is that privacy expectations differ across people and contexts. To illustrate this fact, imagine driving by someone’s house and incidentally glancing through the window. This is unlikely to offend most people. In contrast, using a camera to take a picture from across the street is likely to make most feel uncomfortable; walking up to the house and pressing a face against the glass to peer inside is likely to anger virtually everybody. Although all three of these scenarios are arguably using “public” information, two of the three cross a line that will upset most people. In much the same way, it is possible to go too far with the use of data and cross a threshold that many will see as inconsiderate at best and creepy at worst. </p>
    <p class="normal">Just as computing <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>hardware and statistical methods kicked off the big data era, these methods also unlocked a <strong class="keyWord">post-privacy era</strong> in which<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> many aspects of our lives that were once private are now public, or available to the public at a price. Even prior to the big data era, it would have been possible to learn a great deal about someone by observing public information. Watching their comings and goings may reveal information about their occupation or leisure activity, and a quick glance at their trash and recycling bins may reveal what they eat, drink, and read. A private investigator could learn even more with a bit of focused digging and observation. Companies applying machine learning methods to large datasets are essentially acting as large-scale private investigators, and while they claim to be working on anonymized datasets, many still argue that the companies have gone too far with their digital surveillance.</p>
    <p class="normal">In recent years, some <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>high-profile web applications have experienced a mass exodus of users who felt exploited when the applications’ terms of service agreements changed, or their data was used for purposes beyond what the users had originally intended. The fact that privacy expectations differ by context, age cohort, and locale adds complexity to deciding the appropriate use of personal data. It would be wise to consider the cultural implications of your work before you begin on your project, in addition to being aware of ever-more-restrictive regulations such as the European Union’s <strong class="keyWord">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GDPR</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>the inevitable policies that will follow in its footsteps.</p>

    <p class="normal">Finally, it is important to note that as machine learning algorithms become progressively more important to our everyday lives, there are greater incentives for nefarious actors to work to exploit them. Sometimes, attackers simply want to disrupt algorithms for laughs or notoriety—such as “Google bombing,” the crowdsourced method of tricking Google’s algorithms to highly rank a desired page. Other times, the effects are more dramatic. A timely example of this is the recent wave of so-called fake news and election meddling, propagated via the manipulation of advertising and recommendation algorithms that target people according to their personality. To avoid giving such control to outsiders, when building machine learning systems, it is crucial to consider how they may be influenced by a determined individual or crowd.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Social media scholar danah boyd (styled lowercase) presented a keynote at the Strata Data Conference 2017 in New York City that discussed the importance of hardening machine learning algorithms against attackers. For a recap, refer to <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/your-data-is-being-manipulated-a7e31a83577b"><span class="url">https://points.datasociety.net/your-data-is-being-manipulated-a7e31a83577b</span></a>.</p>

    <p class="normal">The consequences of malicious<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> attacks on machine learning algorithms can also be deadly. Researchers have shown that by creating an “adversarial attack” that subtly distorts a road sign with carefully chosen graffiti, an attacker might cause an autonomous vehicle to misinterpret a stop sign, potentially resulting in a fatal crash. Even in the absence of ill intent, software bugs and human errors have already led to fatal accidents in autonomous vehicle technology from Uber and Tesla. With such examples in mind, it is of the utmost importance and ethical concern that machine learning practitioners should worry about how their algorithms will be used and abused in the real world.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-20">How machines learn</h1>
    <p class="normal">A formal definition of <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>machine learning, attributed to computer scientist Tom M. Mitchell, states that a machine learns whenever it utilizes its experience such that its performance improves on similar experiences in the future. Although this definition makes sense intuitively, it completely ignores the process of exactly how experience is translated into future action—and, of course, learning is always easier said than done!</p>
    <p class="normal">Where human brains are naturally capable of learning from birth, the conditions necessary for computers to learn must be made explicit by the programmer hoping to utilize machine learning methods. For this reason, although it is not strictly necessary to understand the theoretical basis for learning, having a strong theoretical foundation helps the practitioner to understand, distinguish, and implement machine learning algorithms.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">As you relate machine learning to human learning, you may find yourself examining your own mind in a different light.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Regardless of whether the learner is a human or a machine, the basic learning process is the same. It can be divided into four interrelated components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Data storage</strong> utilizes<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> observation, memory, and recall to provide a factual basis for further reasoning.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Abstraction</strong> involves<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> the translation of stored data into broader representations and concepts.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Generalization</strong> uses <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>abstracted data to create knowledge and inferences that drive action in new contexts.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Evaluation</strong> provides <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>a feedback mechanism to measure the utility of learned knowledge and inform potential improvements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal"><img alt="Diagram  Description automatically generated" src="../Images/B17290_01_04.png"/></p>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.4: The four steps in the learning process</p>
    <p class="normal">Although the learning process has been conceptualized here as four distinct components, they are merely organized this way for illustrative purposes. In reality, the entire learning process is inextricably linked. In human beings, the process occurs subconsciously. We recollect, deduce, induct, and intuit within the confines of our mind’s eye, and because this process is hidden, any differences from person to person are attributed to a vague notion of subjectivity. In contrast, computers make these processes explicit, and because the entire process is transparent, the learned knowledge can be examined, transferred, utilized for future action, and treated as a data “science.”</p>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">data science</strong> buzzword suggests a relationship between the data, the machine, and the people who guide the learning<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> process. The term’s growing use in job descriptions and academic degree programs reflects its operationalization as a field of study concerned with both statistical and computational theory, as well as the technological infrastructure enabling machine learning and its applications. The field often asks its practitioners to be compelling storytellers, balancing an audacity in the use of data with the limitations of what one may infer and forecast from it. To be a strong data scientist, therefore, requires a strong understanding of how the learning algorithms work in the context of a business application, as we will discuss in greater detail in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Being Successful with Machine Learning</em>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-21">Data storage</h2>
    <p class="normal">All<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> learning begins with data. Humans and computers alike <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>utilize <strong class="keyWord">data storage</strong> as a foundation for more advanced reasoning. In a human being, this consists of a brain that uses electrochemical signals in a network of biological cells to store and process observations for short- and long-term future recall. Computers have similar capabilities of short- and long-term recall using hard disk drives, flash memory, and <strong class="keyWord">random-access memory</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RAM</strong>) in <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>combination <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>with a <strong class="keyWord">central processing unit</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CPU</strong>).</p>
    <p class="normal">It may seem obvious, but the ability to store and retrieve data alone is insufficient for learning. Stored data is merely ones and zeros on a disk. It is a collection of memories, meaningless without a broader context. Without a higher level of understanding, knowledge is purely recall, limited to what has been seen before and nothing else.</p>
    <p class="normal">To better understand the nuances of this idea, it may help to think about the last time you studied for a difficult test, perhaps for a university final exam or a career certification. Did you wish for an eidetic (photographic) memory? If so, you may be disappointed to know that perfect recall would unlikely be of much assistance. Even if you could memorize material perfectly, this rote learning would provide no benefit without knowing the exact questions and answers that would appear on the exam. Otherwise, you would need to memorize answers to every question that could <em class="italic">conceivably</em> be asked, on a subject in which there is likely to be an infinite number of questions. Obviously, this is an unsustainable strategy.</p>
    <p class="normal">Instead, a better<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> approach is to spend time selectively and memorize a relatively small set of representative ideas, while developing an understanding of how the ideas relate and apply to unforeseen circumstances. In this way, important broader patterns are identified, rather than you memorizing every detail, nuance, and potential application.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-22">Abstraction</h2>
    <p class="normal">This work <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>of assigning a broader meaning to stored data occurs<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> during the <strong class="keyWord">abstraction</strong> process, in which raw data comes to represent a wider, more abstract concept or idea. This type of connection, say between an object and its representation, is exemplified by the famous René Magritte painting <em class="italic">The Treachery of Images</em>.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A picture containing text  Description automatically generated" src="../Images/B17290_01_05.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.5: “This is not a pipe.” Source: http://collections.lacma.org/node/239578</p>
    <p class="normal">The painting depicts a tobacco pipe with the caption <em class="italic">Ceci n’est pas une pipe</em> (“This is not a pipe”). The point Magritte was illustrating is that a representation of a pipe is not truly a pipe. Yet, despite the fact that the pipe is not real, anybody viewing the painting easily recognizes it as a pipe. This suggests that observers can connect the <em class="italic">picture</em> of a pipe to the <em class="italic">idea</em> of a pipe, to a memory of a <em class="italic">physical</em> pipe that can be held in the hand. Abstracted connections like this are the basis <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>of <strong class="keyWord">knowledge representation</strong>, the formation of logical structures that assist with turning raw sensory information into meaningful insight.</p>
    <p class="normal">Bringing this concept full circle, knowledge representation is what allows artificial intelligence-based tools like <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>Midjourney (<a href="https://www.midjourney.com"><span class="url">https://www.midjourney.com</span></a>) to paint, virtually, in the style of René Magritte. The following image was generated entirely by artificial intelligence based on the algorithm’s understanding of concepts like “robot,” “pipe,” and “smoking.” If he were alive yet today, Magritte himself might find it surreal that his own surrealist work, which challenged human conceptions of reality and the connections between images and ideas, is now incorporated into the minds of computers and, in a roundabout way, is connecting machines’ ideas and images to reality. Machines learned what a pipe is, in part, by viewing<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> images of pipes in artwork like Magritte’s.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="../Images/B17290_01_06.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.6: “Am I a pipe?” image created by the Midjourney AI with the prompt of “robot smoking a pipe in the style of a René Magritte painting”</p>
    <p class="normal">To reify the process of knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> representation within an algorithm, the computer summarizes stored raw data using a <strong class="keyWord">model</strong>, an explicit description of the patterns within the data. Just like Magritte’s pipe, the model representation takes on a life beyond the raw data. It represents an idea greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are many different types of <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>models. You may already be familiar with some. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Mathematical equations</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Relational diagrams, such as trees and graphs</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Logical if/else rules</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Groupings of data known as clusters</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The choice of model is typically not left up to the machine. Instead, the learning task and the type of data on hand inform model selection. Later in this chapter, we will discuss in more detail the methods for choosing the appropriate model type.</p>
    <p class="normal">Fitting a model to a <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>dataset is known as <strong class="keyWord">training</strong>. When the <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>model has been trained, the data has been transformed into an abstract form that summarizes the original information. The fact that this step is called “training” rather than “learning” reveals a couple of interesting aspects of the process. First, note that the process of learning does not end with data abstraction—the learner must still generalize and evaluate its training. Second, the word “training” better connotes the fact that the human teacher trains the machine student to use the data toward a specific end.</p>
    <p class="normal">The distinction between training and learning is subtle but important. The computer doesn’t “learn” a model, because this would imply that there is a single correct model to be learned. Of course, the computer must learn <em class="italic">something</em> about the data in order to complete its training, but it has some freedom in how or what exactly it learns. When training the learner using a given dataset, each learner finds its own way to model the data and identify the patterns that will be useful for the given task.</p>
    <p class="normal">It is important to note that a learned model does not itself provide new data, yet it does result in new knowledge. How can this be? The answer is that imposing an assumed structure on the underlying data gives insight into the unseen. It supposes a new concept that describes a way in which existing data elements may be related.</p>
    <p class="normal">Take, for instance, the discovery of gravity. By fitting equations to observational data, Sir Isaac Newton inferred the concept of gravity, but the force we now know as gravity was always present. It simply wasn’t recognized until Newton expressed it as an abstract concept that relates some data to other data—specifically, by becoming the <em class="italic">g</em> term in a model that explains observations of falling objects. The observations of the distance an object falls in various periods of time can be related to each other, via a simple model that applies a constant force of gravity to the object per unit of time.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Table  Description automatically generated" src="../Images/B17290_01_07.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.7: Models are abstractions that explain observed data</p>
    <p class="normal">Most models will not result in the development of theories that shake up scientific thought for centuries. Still, your abstraction might result in the discovery of important, but previously unseen, patterns and relationships among data. A model trained on genomic data might find several genes that when combined are responsible for the onset of diabetes, a bank might discover a seemingly innocuous type of transaction that systematically appears prior to fraudulent activity, or a psychologist might identify a combination of personality characteristics indicating a new disorder. These underlying patterns were always <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>present, but by presenting the information in a different format, a new idea is conceptualized.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-23">Generalization</h2>
    <p class="normal">The third<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> step in the learning process is to use the abstracted knowledge for future action. However, among the countless underlying patterns that may be identified during the abstraction process and the myriad ways to model those patterns, some patterns will be more useful than others. Unless the production of abstractions is limited to the useful set, the learner will be stuck where it started, with a large pool of information but no actionable insight.</p>
    <p class="normal">Formally, the term <strong class="keyWord">generalization</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> defined as the process of turning abstracted knowledge into a form that can be utilized for future action on tasks that are similar, but not identical, to those the learner has seen before. It acts as a search through the entire set of models (that is, the theories or inferences) that <em class="italic">could</em> be established from the data during training. If you can imagine a hypothetical set containing every possible way the data might be abstracted, generalization involves the reduction of this set into a smaller and more manageable set of important findings.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>generalization, the <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>learner is tasked with limiting the patterns it discovers to only those that will be most relevant to its future tasks. Normally, it is not feasible to reduce the number of patterns by examining them one by one and ranking them by future value. Instead, machine learning algorithms generally employ shortcuts that reduce the search space more quickly. To this end, the algorithm will employ <strong class="keyWord">heuristics</strong>, which are educated guesses about where to find the most useful inferences. Heuristics are<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> routinely used by human beings to quickly generalize experience to new scenarios. If you have ever utilized your gut instinct to make a snap decision prior to fully evaluating your circumstances, you were intuitively using mental heuristics.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Heuristics utilize approximations and other rules of thumb, which means they are not guaranteed to find the best model of the data. However, without taking these shortcuts, finding useful information in a large dataset would be infeasible.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The incredible human ability to make quick decisions often relies not on computer-like logic, but rather on emotion-guided heuristics. Sometimes, this can result in illogical conclusions. For example, more people express fear of airline travel than automobile travel, despite automobiles being statistically more dangerous. This can be explained by the availability heuristic, which is the tendency for people to estimate the likelihood of an event by how easily examples can be recalled. Accidents involving air travel are highly publicized. Being traumatic events, they are likely to be recalled very easily, whereas car accidents barely warrant a mention in the newspaper.</p>
    <p class="normal">The folly of misapplied heuristics is not limited to human beings. The heuristics employed by machine learning algorithms also sometimes result in erroneous conclusions. The algorithm is said to have<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> a <strong class="keyWord">bias</strong> if the conclusions are <em class="italic">systematically</em> erroneous, which implies that they are wrong in a consistent or predictable manner. For example, suppose that a machine learning algorithm learned to identify faces by finding two circles representing eyes, positioned above a straight line indicating a mouth. The algorithm might then have trouble with, or be <em class="italic">biased against</em>, faces that do not conform to its model. Faces with glasses, turned at an angle, looking sideways, or with certain skin tones might not be detected by the algorithm. Similarly, it could be <em class="italic">biased toward</em> faces with other skin tones, face shapes, or characteristics that conform to its understanding of the world.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="../Images/B17290_01_08.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.8: The process of generalizing a learner’s experience results in a bias</p>
    <p class="normal">In modern usage, the word “bias” has <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>come to carry quite negative connotations. Various forms of media frequently claim to be free from bias and claim to report facts objectively, untainted by emotion. Still, consider for a moment the possibility that a little bias might be useful. Without a bit of arbitrariness, might it be a little difficult to decide among several competing choices, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses? Indeed, studies in the field of psychology have suggested that individuals born with damage to the portions of the brain responsible for emotion may be ineffectual at decision-making and might spend hours debating simple decisions, such as what color shirt to wear or where to eat lunch. </p>
    <p class="normal">Paradoxically, bias is what blinds us from some information, while also allowing us to utilize other information for action. It is how machine learning algorithms choose among the countless ways to understand a set of data.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-24">Evaluation</h2>
    <p class="normal">Bias is a <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>necessary evil associated with the abstraction and generalization processes inherent in any learning task. In order to drive action in the face of limitless possibility, all learning must have a bias. Consequently, each learning strategy has <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>weaknesses; there is no single learning algorithm to rule them all. Therefore, the final step in the learning process is to evaluate its success and to measure the learner’s performance, despite its biases. The information gained in the evaluation phase can then be used to inform additional training if needed.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Once you’ve had success with one machine learning technique, you might be tempted to apply it to every task. It is important to resist this temptation because no machine learning approach is best for every circumstance. This fact is described by <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>the <strong class="keyWord">No Free Lunch</strong> theorem, introduced by David Wolpert in 1996. Based on the popular adage that “there is no such thing as a free lunch,” the theorem suggests that there is a cost or trade-off in every decision that is made—a life lesson that is true more generally, even outside of <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>machine learning! For more information, visit: <a href="http://www.no-free-lunch.org"><span class="url">http://www.no-free-lunch.org</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Generally, evaluation<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> occurs <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>after a model has been trained on an initial <strong class="keyWord">training dataset</strong>. Then, the model is evaluated on a separate <strong class="keyWord">test dataset</strong> to judge how<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> well its characterization of the training data generalizes to new, unseen cases. It’s worth noting that it is exceedingly rare for a model to perfectly generalize to every unforeseen case—mistakes are almost always inevitable.</p>
    <p class="normal">In part, models fail to generalize perfectly due to the problem of <strong class="keyWord">noise</strong>, a term that describes unexplained or unexplainable <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>variations in data. Noisy data is caused by seemingly random events, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Measurement error due to imprecise sensors that sometimes add or subtract a small amount from the readings</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Issues with human subjects, such as survey respondents reporting random answers to questions in order to finish more quickly</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Data quality problems, including missing, null, truncated, incorrectly coded, or corrupted values</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Phenomena that are so complex or so little understood that they impact the data in ways that appear to be random</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Modeling <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>noise is the basis of a problem called <strong class="keyWord">overfitting</strong>; because most noisy data is <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>unexplainable by definition, attempts to explain the noise will result in models that do not generalize well to new cases. Efforts to explain the noise also typically result in more complex models that miss the true pattern the learner is trying to identify.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Chart  Description automatically generated" src="../Images/B17290_01_09.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.9: Modeling noise generally results in more complex models and misses underlying patterns</p>
    <p class="normal">A model that performs<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> relatively well during training but relatively poorly during evaluation is said to be <strong class="keyWord">overfitted</strong> to the training dataset because it does not generalize well to the test dataset. In practical terms, this means that it has identified a pattern in the data that is not useful for future action; the generalization process has failed. Solutions to the problem of overfitting are specific to each machine learning approach. For now, the important point is to be aware of the issue. How well the methods handle noisy data and avoid overfitting is an important point of distinction among them.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-25">Machine learning in practice</h1>
    <p class="normal">So far, we’ve focused on how machine learning works in theory. To apply the learning process to real-world tasks, we’ll use a five-step process. Regardless of the task, each machine learning algorithm uses the following series of steps:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="keyWord">Data collection</strong>: The data collection<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> step involves gathering the learning material an algorithm will use to generate actionable knowledge. In most cases, the data will need to be combined into a single source, such as a text file, spreadsheet, or database.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Data exploration and preparation</strong>: The quality of any machine learning project is based<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> largely on the quality of its input data. Thus, it is important to learn more about the data and its nuances. Data preparation involves fixing or cleaning so-called “messy” data, eliminating<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> unnecessary data, and re-coding the data to conform to the learner’s expected inputs.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Model training</strong>: By the time the <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>data has been prepared for analysis, you are likely to have a sense of what you are hoping and capable of learning from the data. The specific machine learning task chosen will inform the selection of an appropriate algorithm, and the algorithm will represent the data in the form of a model.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Model evaluation</strong>: Each machine<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> learning model results in a biased solution to the learning problem, which means that it is important to evaluate how well the algorithm learned from its experience. Depending on the type of model used, you might be able to evaluate the accuracy of the model using a test dataset, or you may need to develop measures of performance specific to the intended application.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Model improvement</strong>: If better <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>performance is needed, it becomes necessary to utilize more advanced strategies to augment the model’s performance. Sometimes it may be necessary to switch to a different type of model altogether. You may need to supplement your data with additional data or perform additional preparatory work, as in step 2 of this process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">After these steps have been completed, if the model appears to be performing well, it can be deployed for its intended task. You might utilize your model to provide score data for predictions (possibly in real time); for projections of financial data; to generate useful insight for marketing or research; or to automate tasks, such as mail delivery or flying aircraft. The successes and failures of the deployed model might even provide additional data to train your next-generation learner.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-26">Types of input data</h2>
    <p class="normal">The practice of machine learning <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>involves matching the characteristics of the input data to the biases of the available learning algorithms. Thus, before applying machine learning to real-world problems, it is important to understand the terminology that distinguishes input datasets.</p>
    <p class="normal">The phrase <strong class="keyWord">unit of observation</strong> is used<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> to describe the smallest entity with measured properties of interest for study. Commonly, the unit of observation is in the form of persons, objects or things, transactions, time points, geographic regions, or measurements. Sometimes, units of observation are combined to form units, such as person-years, which denote cases where the same person is tracked over multiple years, and each person-year comprises a person’s data for one year.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">The unit of observation is related, but not identical, to<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> the <strong class="keyWord">unit of analysis</strong>, which is the smallest unit from which inference is made. Although it is often the case, the observed and analyzed units are not always the same. For example, data observed from people (the unit of observation) might be used to analyze trends across countries (the unit of analysis).</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Datasets<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> that store the units of observation and their properties can be described as collections of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Examples</strong>: Instances of the unit of observation for which properties have been recorded</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Features</strong>: Recorded properties or attributes of examples that may be useful for learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">It is easiest to understand features and examples through real-world scenarios. For instance, to build a learning algorithm to identify spam emails, the unit of observation could be email messages, examples would be specific individual messages, and the features might consist of the words used in the messages. For a cancer detection algorithm, the unit of observation could be patients, the examples might include a random sample of cancer patients, and the features may be genomic markers from biopsied cells in addition to patient characteristics, such as weight, height, or blood pressure.</p>
    <p class="normal">People and machines differ in the types of complexity they are suited to handle in the input data. Humans are <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>comfortable consuming <strong class="keyWord">unstructured data</strong>, such as free-form text, pictures, or sound. They are also flexible in handling cases in which some observations have a wealth of features, while others have very little. On the other hand, computers generally require data to<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> be <strong class="keyWord">structured</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>means that each example of the phenomenon has exactly the same set of features, and these features are organized in a form that a computer may understand. Using the brute force of a machine on large, unstructured datasets usually requires a transformation of the input data to a structured form.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>spreadsheet shows data that has been gathered in <strong class="keyWord">matrix format</strong>. In matrix data, each row is an example and each column is a feature. Here, the rows indicate<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> examples of automobiles for sale, while the columns record the automobile’s features, such as the price, mileage, color, and transmission type. Matrix format data is by far the most common form used in machine learning. As you will see in later chapters, when unstructured forms of data are encountered in specialized applications, they are ultimately transformed into a structured matrix format prior to machine learning.</p>

    <p class="normal">A dataset’s features may come in various forms. If a feature represents a characteristic measured in numbers, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>unsurprisingly called <strong class="keyWord">numeric</strong>. Alternatively, if a feature comprises a set of categories, the feature is called <strong class="keyWord">categorical</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">nominal</strong>. A special type of <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>categorical feature<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> is called <strong class="keyWord">ordinal</strong>, which designates a nominal feature with categories falling in an ordered list. One example of an ordinal feature<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> is clothing sizes, such as small, medium, and large; another is a measurement of customer satisfaction on a scale from “not at all happy” to “somewhat happy” to “very happy.” For any given dataset, thinking <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>about what the features represent, their types, and their units will assist with determining an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the learning task.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-27">Types of machine learning algorithms</h2>
    <p class="normal">Machine learning algorithms are <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>divided into categories according to their purpose. Understanding the categories of learning algorithms is an essential first step toward using data to drive the desired action.</p>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="keyWord">predictive model</strong> is used for <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>tasks that involve, as the name implies, the prediction of one value using other values in a dataset. The learning algorithm attempts to discover and model the relationship between <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>the <strong class="keyWord">target</strong> feature (the feature being predicted) and the other features. Despite the common use of the word “prediction” to imply forecasting, predictive models need not necessarily foresee events in the future. For instance, a predictive model could be used to predict past events, such as the date of a baby’s conception using the mother’s present-day hormone levels. Predictive models can also be used in real time to control traffic lights during rush hour.</p>
    <p class="normal">Because predictive models are given clear instructions on what they need to learn and how they are intended to learn it, the process of training a predictive model is known as <strong class="keyWord">supervised learning</strong>. This<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> supervision does not refer to human involvement, but rather to the fact that the target values provide a way for the learner to know how well it has learned the desired task. Stated more formally, given a set of data, a supervised learning algorithm attempts to optimize a function (the model) to find the best combination of feature values, resulting in a target output across all rows in the training data.</p>
    <p class="normal">The often-used supervised machine learning task of predicting which category an example belongs to is known <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>as <strong class="keyWord">classification</strong>. It is easy to think of potential uses for a classifier. For instance, you could predict whether:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">An email message is spam</li>
      <li class="bulletList">A person has cancer</li>
      <li class="bulletList">A football team will win or lose</li>
      <li class="bulletList">An applicant will default on a loan</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In classification, the target feature to be predicted is a categorical feature known as the <strong class="keyWord">class</strong>, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> divided into categories<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> called <strong class="keyWord">levels</strong>. A class can have two or more levels, and the levels may or may not be ordinal. Classification is so widely used in machine learning that there are many types of classification algorithms, with strengths and weaknesses suited for different types of input data. We will see examples of these later in this chapter and many times throughout this book. The first real-world application of classification appears in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Lazy Learning – Classification Using Nearest Neighbors</em>, and additional examples appear in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Probabilistic Learning – Classification Using Naive Bayes</em>, and <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Divide and Conquer – Classification Using Decision Trees and Rules</em>, among others.</p>
    <p class="normal">Supervised learners <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>can also be used to predict numeric data, such as income, laboratory values, test scores, or counts of items. To predict such numeric values, a common form <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>of <strong class="keyWord">numeric prediction</strong> fits linear regression models to the input data. Although regression is not the only method for numeric prediction, it is by far the most widely used. Regression methods are widely used for forecasting, as they quantify in exact terms the association between the inputs and the target, including both the magnitude and uncertainty of the relationship. Many supervised learning algorithms can perform numeric prediction, but regression methods and numeric prediction are covered in detail in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Forecasting Numeric Data – Regression Methods</em>.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Since it is easy to convert numbers to categories (for example, ages 13 to 19 are teenagers) and categories to numbers (for example, assign 1 to all males and 0 to all females), the boundary between classification models and numeric prediction models is not necessarily firm.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="keyWord">descriptive model</strong> is used<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> for tasks that would benefit from the insight gained from summarizing data in new and interesting ways. As opposed to predictive models that predict a target of interest, in a descriptive model, no single feature is of particular interest. Because there is no target to learn, the process of training a descriptive model is <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>called <strong class="keyWord">unsupervised learning</strong>. Although it can be more difficult to think of applications for descriptive models—after all, what good is a learner that isn’t learning anything in particular—they are used quite regularly for data mining.</p>
    <p class="normal">For example, the descriptive modeling task<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> called <strong class="keyWord">pattern discovery</strong> is used to identify useful associations within data. Pattern discovery is the goal of <strong class="keyWord">market basket analysis</strong>, which is <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>applied to retailers’ transactional purchase data. Here, retailers hope to identify items that are frequently purchased together, such that the learned information can be used to refine marketing tactics. For instance, if a retailer learns that swimsuits are commonly purchased at the same time as sunscreen, the retailer might reposition the items more closely in the store or run a promotion to “up-sell” associated items to customers. The methods needed to perform this type of analysis are included in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Finding Patterns – Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules</em>.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Originally used only in retail contexts, pattern discovery is now starting to be used in quite innovative ways. For instance, it can be used to detect patterns of fraudulent behavior, screen for genetic defects, or identify hotspots for criminal activity.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>descriptive <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>modeling task of dividing a dataset into homogeneous groups is called <strong class="keyWord">clustering</strong>. This is sometimes used<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> for <strong class="keyWord">segmentation analysis</strong>, which identifies groups of individuals with similar behavior or demographic information, in order to target them with advertising campaigns based on their shared characteristics. With this approach, a machine identifies the clusters, but human intervention is required to interpret them. For example, given a grocery store’s five customer clusters, the marketing team will need to understand the differences among the groups in order to create a promotion that best suits each group. Despite this human effort, this is still less work than creating a unique appeal for each customer. This type of segmentation analysis is demonstrated on a real-world dataset in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Finding Groups of Data – Clustering with k-means</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Unsupervised learning can also be used to assist with supervised learning tasks where labeled data is unavailable or costly to obtain. A method called <strong class="keyWord">semi-supervised learning</strong> uses a small <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>amount of labeled data in conjunction with an unsupervised learning analysis to help categorize the unlabeled records, which can then be used directly in a supervised learning model. For example, if it is expensive for a physician to label tumor samples as cancerous or non-cancerous, only a small portion of the patient records may have these labels. However, after performing unsupervised clustering on the patient data, it may be the case that the confirmed cancer and non-cancer patients fall into mostly separate groups, and thus the unlabeled records can inherit the labels of their cluster. Thus, a predictive model can be built on the complete set of data rather than the small portion that had been manually labeled. An application of semi-supervised learning is included in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Finding Groups of Data – Clustering with k-means</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">An even more extreme version of this approach<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> known as <strong class="keyWord">self-supervised learning</strong> requires no manually labeled data whatsoever; instead, it uses a two-step approach in which a sophisticated model first attempts to identify meaningful groupings among records, and the second model attempts to identify the key distinctions between the groups. This is a relatively recent innovation and is used primarily on large, unstructured data sources like audio, text, and image data. The building blocks of self-supervised learning are covered in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Black-Box Methods – Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines</em>, and <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italic">Making Use of Big Data</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Lastly, a <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>class of machine learning algorithms known<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> as <strong class="keyWord">meta-learners</strong> is not tied to a specific learning task, but rather is focused on learning how to learn more effectively. Meta-learning can be beneficial for very challenging problems or when a predictive algorithm’s performance needs to be as accurate as possible. All meta-learning algorithms use the result of past learning to inform additional learning. Most commonly, this encompasses algorithms that learn to work together in <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>teams called <strong class="keyWord">ensembles</strong>. Just as complementary strengths and accumulated experiences are important factors for successful human teams, they are likewise valuable for machine learners, and ensembles are among the most powerful off-the-shelf algorithms available today. Several of the most popular ensemble learning algorithms are covered in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Building Better Learners</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">A form of meta-learning involving algorithms that seem to evolve over time is called <strong class="keyWord">reinforcement learning</strong>. This <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>technique involves a simulation in which the learner is rewarded for success or punished for failure and, over many iterations, seeks the highest cumulative reward. The algorithm improves at the desired learning task via the evolutionary pressure of rewards and punishment, applied to the simulated “offspring” of the learner that accumulates more beneficial random adaptations and jettisons the least helpful mutations over successive generations.</p>
    <p class="normal">In contrast to supervised learning algorithms that are trained based on a labeled set of data, reinforcement learning can achieve performance even better than the human trainer on a learning task, as it is not limited to training on the data on hand. Stated differently, traditional supervised learners tend to mimic the existing data, but reinforcement learning can identify novel and unforeseen solutions to the task—sometimes to surprising or even comical results. For instance, reinforcement learners trained to play video games have discovered cheats or shortcuts to complete games like <em class="italic">Sonic the Hedgehog</em> much faster than humans, but in ways designers did not intend. Similarly, a learning algorithm trained to pilot a simulated moon lander discovered that a crash landing is faster than a gentle landing—apparently unphased by the consequences of what this would do to the fortunately hypothetical human passengers!</p>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> reinforcement learning technique, although extremely powerful, is quite computationally expensive and is vastly different from the traditional learning <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>methods described previously. It is generally applied to real-world cases in which the learner can perform the task quickly and repeatedly to determine its success. This means that it is less useful for predicting cancer, or business outcomes like churn and loan default, and more useful for stereotypical artificial intelligence applications like self-driving vehicles and other forms of automation, where success or failure is easily measurable, immediate, and can be simulated in a controlled environment. For such reasons, reinforcement learning is outside the scope of this book, although it is a fascinating topic to monitor closely in the future.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">For more humorous stories about the unexpected solutions reinforcement learners have discovered, see Tom Simonite’s article, <em class="italic">When Bots Teach Themselves to Cheat</em>, at <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-bots-teach-themselves-to-cheat/"><span class="url">https://www.wired.com/story/when-bots-teach-themselves-to-cheat/</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Clearly, much of the most exciting work being done in the field of machine learning today is in the domain of meta-learning. In addition to ensembles and reinforcement learning, the promising field<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> of <strong class="keyWord">adversarial learning</strong> involves learning about a model’s weaknesses to strengthen its future performance or harden it against malicious attacks. This may involve pitting algorithms against one another, such as building a reinforcement learning algorithm to produce fake photographs that can fool facial detection algorithms or identify transaction patterns that can bypass fraud detection. This is just one avenue of building better learning algorithms; there is also heavy investment in research and development efforts to make bigger and faster ensembles, which can model massive datasets using high-performance computers or cloud-computing environments. Starting with the base algorithms, we will touch on many of these fascinating innovations in the upcoming chapters.</p>

    <p class="normal">To begin <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>applying machine learning to a<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> real-world project, you will need to determine which of the four learning tasks your project represents: classification, numeric prediction, pattern detection, or clustering. The task will drive the choice of algorithm. For instance, if you are undertaking pattern detection, you are likely to employ association rules. Similarly, a clustering problem will likely utilize the k-means algorithm, and numeric prediction will utilize regression analysis or regression trees.</p>
    <p class="normal">For classification, more thought is needed to match a learning problem to an appropriate classifier. In these cases, it is helpful to consider the various distinctions among the algorithms—distinctions that will only be apparent by studying each of the classifiers in depth. For instance, within classification problems, decision trees result in models that are readily understood, while the models of neural networks are notoriously difficult to interpret. If you were designing a credit scoring model, this could be an important distinction because the law often requires that the applicant must be notified about the reasons they were rejected for a loan. Even if the neural network is better at predicting loan defaults, if its predictions cannot be explained, then it is useless for this application.</p>
    <p class="normal">To assist with<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> algorithm selection, in<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> every chapter the key strengths and weaknesses of each learning algorithm are listed. Although you will sometimes find that these characteristics exclude certain models from consideration, in many cases the choice of algorithm is arbitrary. When this is true, feel free to use whichever algorithm you are most comfortable with. Other times, when predictive accuracy is the primary goal, you may need to test several models and choose the one that fits best, or use a meta-learning approach that combines several different learners to utilize the strengths of each.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-29">Machine learning with R</h1>
    <p class="normal">Many of the algorithms needed for machine learning are not included as part of the base R installation. Instead, the algorithms are available via a large community of experts who have shared their work freely. These must be installed on top of base R manually. Thanks to R’s status as free open-source software, there is no additional charge for this functionality.</p>
    <p class="normal">A collection of R functions that can be shared among <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>users is called a <strong class="keyWord">package</strong>. Free packages exist for each of the machine learning algorithms covered in this book. In fact, this book only covers a small portion of all of R’s machine learning packages.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you are interested in the breadth of <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>R packages, you can view a list at the <strong class="keyWord">Comprehensive R Archive Network</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CRAN</strong>), a collection of web and FTP sites located around the world to provide the most up-to-date versions of R software and packages. If you obtained the R software via download, it was most likely from CRAN. The CRAN website<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> is available at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html"><span class="url">http://cran.r-project.org/index.html</span></a>.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">If you do not already have R, the CRAN website also provides installation instructions and information on where to find help if you have trouble.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Packages</strong> link on <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>the left side of the CRAN page will take you to a page where you can browse the packages in alphabetical order or sorted by publication date. At the time of writing, a total of 18,910 packages were available—over 35 percent more than when the third edition of this book was written, nearly three times the number since the second edition, and over four times since the first edition roughly 10 years ago! Clearly, the R community has been thriving, and this trend shows no sign of slowing!</p>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Task Views</strong> link on the<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> left side of the CRAN page provides a curated list of packages by subject area. The task view for machine learning, which lists the packages covered in this book (and many more), is available at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/view=MachineLearning"><span class="url">https://cran.r-project.org/view=MachineLearning</span></a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-30">Installing R packages</h2>
    <p class="normal">Despite the vast set of available <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>R add-ons, the package format makes installation and use a virtually effortless process. To demonstrate the use of packages, we will install and load the <code class="inlineCode">gmodels</code> package maintained by Gregory R. Warnes, which contains a variety of functions to aid model fitting and data analysis. We’ll use one of the package’s functions throughout many of this book’s chapters to compare model predictions to the true values. For more<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> information on this package, see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=gmodels"><span class="url">https://cran.r-project.org/package=gmodels</span></a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">The most direct way to install a package is via the <code class="inlineCode">install.packages()</code> function. To install the <code class="inlineCode">gmodels</code> package, at the R command prompt simply type:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&gt; install.packages(<span class="hljs-string">"gmodels"</span>)
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">R will then connect to CRAN and download the package in the correct format for your operating system. Many packages require additional packages to be installed before they can be used. These are <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>called <strong class="keyWord">dependencies</strong>. By default, the installer will automatically download and install any dependencies.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">The first time you install a package, R may ask you to choose a CRAN mirror. If this happens, choose the mirror residing at a location close to you. This will generally provide the fastest download speed.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The default installation options are appropriate for most systems. However, in some cases, you may want to install a package in another location. For example, if you do not have root or administrator privileges on your system, you may need to specify an alternative installation path. </p>
    <p class="normal">This can be accomplished using the <code class="inlineCode">lib</code> option as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&gt; install.packages(<span class="hljs-string">"gmodels"</span>, lib = <span class="hljs-string">"/path/to/library"</span>)
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The installation<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> function also provides additional options for installing from a local file, installing from source, or using experimental versions. You can read about these options in the help file by using the following command:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&gt; ?install.packages
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">More generally, the question mark operator can be used to obtain help on any R function. Simply type <code class="inlineCode">?</code> before the name of the function.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-31">Loading and unloading R packages</h2>
    <p class="normal">In order <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>to conserve memory, R does not load every installed package by default. Instead, packages are loaded by users with the <code class="inlineCode">library()</code> function as they are needed.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">The name of this function leads some people to incorrectly use the terms “library” and “package” interchangeably. However, to be precise, a library refers to the location where packages are installed and never to a package itself.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">To load the <code class="inlineCode">gmodels</code> package<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> installed previously, you can type the following: </p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&gt; library(gmodels)
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Aside from <code class="inlineCode">gmodels</code>, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>many other R packages, which will be used in later chapters. A reminder to install these packages will be provided as these packages are needed.</p>
    <p class="normal">To unload an<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> R package, use the <code class="inlineCode">detach()</code> function. For example, to unload the <code class="inlineCode">gmodels</code> package <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>shown previously, use the following command:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&gt; detach(<span class="hljs-string">"package:gmodels"</span>, unload = <span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span>)
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This will free up any resources used by the package.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-32">Installing RStudio</h2>
    <p class="normal">After you have installed R from the CRAN website, it is highly recommended to also install the open-source <strong class="keyWord">RStudio</strong> desktop application. RStudio is <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>an additional interface to R that includes functionalities that make it far easier, more convenient, and more interactive to work with R code. </p>
    <p class="normal">The RStudio Open Source Edition is available free of charge<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> from Posit (<a href="https://www.posit.co/"><span class="url">https://www.posit.co/</span></a>) alongside a paid RStudio Pro Edition that offers priority support and additional features for commercial organizations.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated" src="../Images/B17290_01_11.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.11: The RStudio desktop environment makes R easier and more convenient to use</p>
    <p class="normal">The RStudio interface comprises <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>an <strong class="keyWord">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IDE</strong>) including a code editor, an R command-line console, a file browser, and an R object browser. R code syntax is automatically colorized, and the code’s output, plots, and graphics are displayed directly within the environment, which makes it much easier to follow long or complex statements and programs. More advanced features allow R project and package management; integration with source control or version control tools, such as Git and Subversion; database connection management; and the compilation of R output to HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word formats. It is even possible to write Python code within RStudio!</p>
    <p class="normal">RStudio is a key reason<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> why R is a top choice for data scientists today. It wraps the power of R programming and its tremendous library of machine learning and statistical packages in an easy-to-use and easy-to-install development interface. It is not only ideal for learning R but can also grow with you as you learn R’s more advanced functionality.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">The RStudio Desktop software is developed by a company <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>called Posit, which was formerly known itself as RStudio. The rebranding, which was somewhat surprising to fans of RStudio, occurred in late 2022 and is intended to reflect the company’s broadening focus on Python as well as R. At the time of writing, the name of the desktop IDE <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>software remains RStudio. For more information, see <a href="https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-now-posit/"><span class="url">https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-now-posit/</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-33">Why R and why R now?</h2>
    <p class="normal">Depending on whom you might ask, when the first edition of this book was published in 2013, R probably had a<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> slight, if not substantial, lead over Python in user adoption for machine learning and what is now known as data science. In the time since, Python usage has grown substantially, and it would be hard to argue against the fact that Python is the new frontrunner, although the race may be closer than one might expect given the enthusiasm from Python fans supporting the new and shiny tool with greater hype.</p>
    <p class="normal">Granted, in the past 10 years, Python has benefitted much from the rapid maturation of free add-ons like the scikit-learn machine learning framework, the pandas data structure library, the Matplotlib plotting library, and the Jupyter notebook interface, among numerous other open-source libraries that made it easier than ever to do data science in Python. Of course, these libraries merely brought Python to feature parity with what R and RStudio could do already! However, these add-ons, when combined with the comparatively fast and memory-efficient Python code—at least relative to R—may have contributed to the fact that Python is now undoubtedly the language most often taught in formal data science degree programs and has rapidly gained adoption in business domains.</p>
    <p class="normal">Rather than indicating the impending death of R, the rise of Python may simply reflect the growth of the field. In fact, R usage is likewise growing quickly, and R and RStudio may be more popular than ever. Although students sometimes ask whether it is even worth starting with R rather than jumping straight into Python, there are still many good reasons one might choose to learn machine learning with R rather than the alternative. Note that these justifications are quite subjective and there is no single right answer for everyone, so I hesitate to even put this in writing! However, having supported this book for nearly a decade, and as someone who still uses R on a near-daily basis as part of my work for a large, international corporation, here are a few things I’ve noticed: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">R may be<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> more intuitive and easier to learn for people with social science or business backgrounds (such as economics, marketing, and so on) whereas Python may make more sense to computer scientists and other types of engineers.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">R tends to be used more like a “calculator” in that you type a command, and something happens; in general, coding in Python tends to require more thought about loops and other program flow commands (this distinction is fading over time with the additional functionality in popular Python libraries).</li>
      <li class="bulletList">R uses relatively few types of data structures (those included are tailored for data analysis) and the often-used spreadsheet-like data format is a built-in data type; comparably, Python has many specialized data structures and uses libraries like NumPy or pandas for the matrix data format, each of which has their own syntax to learn.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">R and its packages may be easier to install and update than Python, in part because Python is managed by some operating systems by default, and keeping dependencies and environments separate is challenging (modern Python installation tools and package managers have addressed this while simultaneously, in some ways, making the problem worse!). </li>
      <li class="bulletList">R is typically slower and more memory-hungry than Python for data manipulation and iterating over large data structures, but if the data fits in memory, this difference is somewhat negligible; R has improved in this area (see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Advanced Data Preparation</em>, for some ways in which R is making data preparation faster and easier), and for data that doesn’t fit in memory, there are workarounds (as described in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italic">Making Use of Big Data</em>), but this is admittedly one of Python’s major advantages.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">R has the support and vision of the team at Posit (formerly known as RStudio) driving innovation and making R easier and more pleasurable to use within a unified RStudio Desktop software environment; in contrast, Python’s innovations are occurring on multiple fronts, offering more “right” ways of<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> accomplishing the same thing (for better or worse).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">With any luck, the above reasons give you the confidence to begin your R journey! There’s no shame in starting here, and regardless of whether you remain with R for the long term, use it side by side with other languages like Python, or graduate to something else altogether, the foundational principles you learn in this book will transfer to whatever tools you choose. Although the book’s code is written in R, it is highly encouraged that you use the right tool for the job, whatever you feel that might be. You may find, as I have myself, that R and RStudio are your preferred tools for many real-world data science and machine learning projects—even if you still occasionally take advantage of Python’s unique strengths!</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-34">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">Machine learning originated at the intersection of statistics, database science, and computer science. It is a powerful tool, capable of finding actionable insight in large quantities of data. Still, as we have seen in this chapter, caution must be used in order to avoid common abuses of machine learning in the real world.</p>
    <p class="normal">Conceptually, the learning process involves the abstraction of data into a structured representation, and the generalization of the structure into action that can be evaluated for utility. In practical terms, a machine learner uses data containing examples and features of the concept to be learned, then summarizes this data in the form of a model, which is used for predictive or descriptive purposes. These purposes can be grouped into tasks including classification, numeric prediction, pattern detection, and clustering. Among the many possible methods, machine learning algorithms are chosen based on the input data and the learning task.</p>
    <p class="normal">R provides support for machine learning in the form of community-authored packages. These powerful tools are available to download at no cost but need to be installed before they can be used. Each chapter in this book will introduce such packages as they are needed.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will further introduce the basic R commands that are used to manage and prepare data for machine learning. Though you might be tempted to skip this step and jump directly into applications, a common rule of thumb suggests that 80 percent or more of the time spent on typical machine learning projects is devoted to the step of data preparation, also known as “data wrangling.” As a result, investing some effort into learning how to do this effectively will pay dividends for you later.</p>
