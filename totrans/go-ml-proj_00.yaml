- en: Go is the perfect language for machine learning. Its simple syntax helps to
    clearly describe complex algorithms, but does not obscure developers from understand
    how to run efficient optimized code. This book will teach you how to implement
    machine learning in Go to make programs that are easy to deploy and code that
    is not only easy to understand and debug, but that can also have its performance
    measured.

- en: The book begins by guiding you in setting up your machine learning environment
    with Go libraries and capabilities. You will then plunge into regression analysis
    of a real-life house pricing dataset and build a classification model in Go to
    classify emails as spam or ham. Using Gonum, Gorgonia, and STL, you will explore
    time series analysis, along with decomposition and how to clean up your personal
    Twitter timeline by clustering tweets. In addition to this, you will learn how
    to recognize handwriting using neural networks and convolutional neural networks,
    both of which are deep learning techniques. Once you've covered all the techniques,
    you'll learn how to choose the most appropriate machine learning algorithms to
    use for your projects with the help of a facial detection project.

    a strong hold on the powerful Go libraries, and a sound understanding of the practical
    implementations of machine learning algorithms in real-world projects.
