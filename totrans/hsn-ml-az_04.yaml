- en: 'A chatbot, or bot, is an application that allows you to have a human-like dialogue
    via text, image, or speech. A bot can be integrated into either a web app or a
    mobile app. Different applications, such as Facebook Messenger, Kik, WeChat, or
    Skype, support various types of bots that might help you to find answers to a
    specific question, book an appointment at a salon, or book a table at a restaurant.
    Chatting with a bot should be like chatting with a customer care agent or a friend. Here
    is an example bot that is helping to answer questions about the weather inside
    Facebook Messenger. This bot was built by Microsoft, and is known as the Zo bot:'

    it can handle based on user demand. To give you an idea of how easy it is to create
    intelligent and powerful bots, we will create a bot using Bot Service, which will
    cover all of the aforementioned components.

    Bot Framework Channel Emulator. The Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application
    to test your bot, while the Bot Framework Channel Emulator helps you test how
    your bot will look and work on different channels.

    to create more intelligent bots. Both QnA Maker and LUIS are cognitive services

    and publishes the bot. All you need to create a bot in this way is an Azure subscription.
