- en: The objective of part 1 is to introduce the reader to machine learning and the
    different types of models used. It will cover supervised and unsupervised learning,
    the principal division within machine learning. Within these aspects, the difference
    between regression (continuous target variable) and classification (discrete target
    variable) will be demonstrated. All points are explained by means of hands-on
    examples.
