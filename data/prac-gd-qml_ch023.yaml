    of this book, we’ve covered a lot of topics on quantum computing, both from a
    theoretical and a practical point of view, so maybe it’s time to take a look back
    and see what we have learned.

  zh: 这已经是一次漫长且（希望）有趣的旅程。在这本书的12章中，我们从理论和实践的角度涵盖了量子计算的大量主题，也许现在是时候回顾一下我们所学到的内容了。
- en: 'We started by laying the foundations. We studied the most important mathematical
    concepts underlying the theory of quantum computing, including how information
    is stored on qubits, how we can transform their states with quantum gates, and
    how we can obtain results by measuring them. Then, we explored some of the software
    tools currently available to implement quantum algorithms, with a special emphasis
    on the two main software libraries used in this book: Qiskit and PennyLane. We
    learned how to implement quantum circuits with both frameworks and how to run
    them on simulators and on actual quantum hardware.'

  zh: 我们首先奠定了基础。我们研究了量子计算理论背后的最重要的数学概念，包括信息如何在量子比特上存储，我们如何使用量子门转换它们的状态，以及我们如何通过测量它们来获得结果。然后，我们探索了一些目前可用的软件工具，以实现量子算法，特别强调了本书中使用的两个主要软件库：Qiskit和PennyLane。我们学习了如何使用这两个框架实现量子电路，以及如何在模拟器和实际量子硬件上运行它们。
- en: Then, we began to uncover how quantum algorithms can be used to solve optimization
    problems. To that end, we studied different ways of formulating combinatorial
    optimization problems as the search for ground states of certain Hamiltonians.
    This is how we got to know the QUBO and Ising formalisms, that we later used with
    different types of quantum computers. First, we used quantum annealers, with their
    heuristic implementation of adiabatic quantum computing, and we learned different
    ways of solving optimization problems with them. Then, we turned to gate-based
    quantum computers, and studied the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
    and Grover’s Adaptive Search.

  zh: 然后，我们开始揭示量子算法如何用于解决优化问题。为此，我们研究了将组合优化问题表述为寻找某些哈密顿量的基态的不同方法。这就是我们了解到QUBO和Ising公式的途径，我们后来在多种类型的量子计算机上使用了这些公式。首先，我们使用了量子退火器，它具有启发式的绝热量子计算实现，并学习了使用它们解决优化问题的不同方法。然后，我们转向基于门的量子计算机，并研究了量子近似优化算法和Grover的自适应搜索。
- en: After that, we widened the scope of our optimization tasks and studied situations
    in which our interest was set on finding ground states of observables related
    to problems in different fields, including chemistry and physics. In this case,
    our focus was on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. At the same time that we
    studied its mathematical definition and its practical implementation, we also
    learned about noisy simulations and readout error mitigation.

  zh: 之后，我们扩大了优化任务的范围，并研究了在化学和物理学等不同领域的问题中寻找与可观测量相关的基态的情况。在这种情况下，我们的重点是变分量子本征值求解器。同时，我们研究了它的数学定义和其实际实现，还了解了噪声模拟和读出错误缓解。
- en: Then, we changed gears and started studying the application of quantum computing
    in machine learning. We first briefly reviewed *classical* machine learning and
    explained what makes quantum machine learning different. Then, we started studying
    several quantum machine learning model architectures. The first was that of Quantum
    Support Vector Machines, which we derived from classical SVMs by introducing quantum
    kernels.

  zh: 然后，我们转换了方向，开始研究量子计算在机器学习中的应用。我们首先简要回顾了*经典*机器学习，并解释了量子机器学习与经典机器学习有何不同。然后，我们开始研究几种量子机器学习模型架构。第一种是量子支持向量机，我们通过引入量子核从经典SVM推导出它。

    neural networks that are called — not very imaginatively, we concede — quantum
    neural networks. For this, we used parametrized circuits in two different ways:'

- en: 'Then, we decided to play a little bit with our new, shiny quantum neural networks
    and we mixed them with classical neural networks to form hybrid neural networks.
    We also learned a thing or two about hyperparameter optimization with Optuna and
    about building and training classical and hybrid networks with PyTorch. All this
    hard work paid off soon, because it allowed us to implement a very interesting
    model architecture: that of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. We learned
    a little bit about the theory behind them and we showed how to implement and train
    a couple of simple examples to learn quantum states and probability distributions.'

  zh: 然后，我们决定用我们的新、亮丽的量子神经网络玩玩，我们将它们与经典神经网络混合，形成混合神经网络。我们还从Optuna学到了一些关于超参数优化的知识，以及如何使用PyTorch构建和训练经典和混合网络。所有这些艰苦的工作很快就得到了回报，因为它使我们能够实现一个非常有趣的模型架构：量子生成对抗网络。我们了解了一些关于其背后的理论，并展示了如何实现和训练几个简单的示例来学习量子状态和概率分布。
- en: 'Most of the methods that we have studied are what we may call modern quantum
    algorithms: they have been proposed in the last 10 years or so, mainly with current,
    noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers in mind. And they are the subject of
    intense development and study by the quantum computing community as we are writing
    these lines. You may very well say that, with this book, you now know a good deal

- en: But this should be just the dawn of quantum computing. As wonderful as the ideas
    behind the methods and devices that we have studied may be (and they truly are!),
    they still have some limitations (that sometimes are painfully obvious). Due to
    the reduced scale and resilience to the noise of current quantum computers and
    due to our incomplete understanding of the capabilities of modern quantum algorithms
    such as QAOA, VQE, or the different flavors of quantum neural networks, it is
    difficult to demonstrate quantum computational advantage. In fact, in the cases
    in which this has been achieved (the most famous one being the quantum supremacy
    experiment developed by Google researchers [[9](ch030.xhtml#Xarute2019quantum)]),
    the problems are mainly academic and of little practical application.

  zh: 但这仅仅是量子计算的黎明。我们研究的方法和设备背后的想法可能多么奇妙（它们确实如此！），但它们仍然存在一些局限性（有时这些局限性是痛苦明显的）。由于当前量子计算机的规模较小、对噪声的抵抗能力有限，以及我们对现代量子算法（如QAOA、VQE或不同类型的量子神经网络）的能力理解不完整，很难证明量子计算的优势。事实上，在已经实现这一目标的情况下（最著名的是谷歌研究人员开发的量子霸权实验[[9](ch030.xhtml#Xarute2019quantum)]），这些问题主要是学术性的，实际应用价值很小。

    On the contrary! There is still much work to do, but we think that we are experiencing
    the beginning of what could very well be a revolution in the way we compute and

    about quantum computers! But we are especially interested in the second one. We
    need to keep on investigating, further pushing the frontiers of our knowledge,
    and exploring new techniques for processing information with quantum devices.
    To that end, in the next few years, we expect to see developments on different

    computers. In fact, while we were writing this book, IBM announced Osprey, a quantum
    processor with 433 qubits [[55](ch030.xhtml#Xibm2022osprey)]. But that is not
    all. They plan to introduce quantum computers with thousands of qubits in the
    next few years and other big companies such as Google and Honeywell have similar
    roadmaps. Size is not the only thing that matters, though, and a lot of effort
    is being put into decreasing gate and readout errors and in increasing coherence
    times. This will be crucial to reach the ultimate goal of having fault-tolerant,
    scalable quantum computers.

    be not very useful from a practical point of view. However, we think that pursuing
