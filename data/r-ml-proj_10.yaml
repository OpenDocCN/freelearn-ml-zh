  zh: 最后，我们来到了本书的结尾章节！
- en: The year 2018 can be considered a boom year for data science, **machine learning**
    (**ML**), and **artificial intelligence** (**AI**). Just look at the number of
    start-ups with the terms ML and AI in their tag lines, the focal points for acquisitions
    on the part of big companies, and the topics at the biggest tech conferences.
    It does not take a long time for us to realize that data, ML, and AI are omnipresent,
    and I believe that this trend is going to continue for a few years to come. More
    and more industries are going to utilize ML and AI in a big way. This essentially
    is going to create gaps in available talent in terms of implementing ML and AI
    in businesses. Therefore, this is the best time to invest in learning more and
    more in this area. AI and ML skills, combined with business skills, will be the
    most highly prized within the industry.

  zh: 2018年可以被认为是数据科学、**机器学习**（**ML**）和**人工智能**（**AI**）的繁荣年份。只需看看有多少初创公司在他们的标语中包含ML和AI，大公司收购的焦点，以及最大技术会议的主题。我们很快就会意识到数据、ML和AI无处不在，我相信这种趋势在未来几年还将持续。越来越多的行业将大规模利用ML和AI。这本质上将在实施ML和AI的业务人才方面创造差距。因此，这是在这个领域投入更多学习的最佳时机。AI和ML技能与商业技能的结合将在行业内受到高度重视。
- en: We also need to realize that the AI and ML space is evolving rapidly – new ML
    algorithms, new platforms, new infrastructure, and new types of data are just
    a few examples. To stay relevant, the only option is to keep ourselves updated
    with the newest trends and techniques out there. The other characteristics that
    are the most sought-after are unlearning the old and learning the new, and being
    flexible and modest enough to say, *it is okay that I don't know, but I am open
    to learning*.

  zh: 我们还需要意识到，人工智能和机器学习领域正在快速发展——新的机器学习算法、新的平台、新的基础设施和新的数据类型只是其中几个例子。为了保持相关性，唯一的选择是让自己跟上最新的趋势和技术。其他最被追求的特征是忘记旧知识，学习新知识，以及足够灵活和谦逊地说，*不知道没关系，但我愿意学习*。
- en: Finally, what is the best way to learn and stay on top of things? Of course,
    there is no dearth of resources—**Massive Open Online Courses** (**MOOCs**), books,
    blogs, conferences, seminars, classes, and so on. All that is needed is time and
    a willingness to learn. Happy learning in order to happily excel!
