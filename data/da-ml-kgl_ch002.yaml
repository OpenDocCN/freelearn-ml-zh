- en: Competitive programming has a long story, starting in the 1970s with the first
    editions of the **ICPC**, the “**International Collegiate Programming Contest**”.
    In the original ICPC, small teams from universities and companies participated
    in a competition that required solving a series of problems using a computer program
    (at the beginning participants coded in FORTRAN). In order to achieve a good final
    rank, teams had to display good skills in team working, problem solving and programming.

  zh: 竞赛编程有着悠久的历史，始于20世纪70年代，当时举办了第一届**国际大学生程序设计竞赛（ICPC**）。“**国际大学生程序设计竞赛**”最初由来自大学和公司的小型团队参加，要求使用计算机程序（最初参赛者使用FORTRAN编程）解决一系列问题。为了获得良好的最终排名，团队必须展示出良好的团队合作、问题解决和编程技能。
- en: 'The experience of participating in the heat of such a competition and the opportunity
    to have a spotlight for recruiting companies provided the students enough motivation
    and it made the competition popular for many years. Among ICPC finalists, a few
    ones have become renowned. Among these, there is Adam D''Angelo, the former CTO
    of Facebook and founder of Quora, Nikolai Durov, the co-founder of Telegram Messenger,
    and Matei Zaharia, the creator of Apache Spark. Together with many others professionals,
    they all share the same experience: having taken part to an ICPC edition.'

    manner algorithms and data transformations in order to find the best possible
    combinations but you lack man and computer power for that. That’s why for instance,
    governments and companies resort to competitions in order to advance in certain
    fields. On the government side, we can quote DARPA and its many competitions on
    self-driving cars, robotic operations, machine translation, speaker identification,
    fingerprint recognition, information retrieval, OCR, automatic target recognition,
    and many others. On the business side, we can quote a company such as Netflix,

- en: 'The Netflix competition was based on the idea of improving existing collaborative
    filtering, whose purpose is simply to predict the potential rating of a user for
    film, solely based on the previous ratings that the user gave on other films without
    knowing in specific who the user is or what the films are. Since no user description
    or movie title or description were available (all replaced by identity codes),
    the competition required to develop smart ways to use the available past ratings.
    The grand prize of USD $1,000,000 was to be assigned only if the solution could
    improve the existing Netflix algorithm, Cinematch, above a certain threshold.
    The competition run from 2006 to 2009 and in the end saw a team made up by the
    fusion of many previously teams in competitions (a team from Commendo Research
    & Consulting GmbH, Andreas Töscher and Michael Jahrer, quite renown also in Kaggle
    competitions, two researchers from AT&T Labs and two others from Yahoo!). In the
    end, winning the competition required so much computation power and the ensembling
    of different solutions, that teams were forced to merge in order to keep pace.
    Such situation, reflected also on the actual usage of the solution by Netflix,
    which preferred not to implement it, but to simply take the most interesting insight
    from it in order to improve its existing Cinematch algorithm (you can read more
    about it on this Wired article: [https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/)).
    What mattered more in the end of the Netflix competition has not been the solution
    per se, which has been quickly superseded by the change in business of Netflix
    from DVDs to online movies. The real benefit for both participants (who gained
    a huge reputation in collaborative filtering) and the company (who could transfer
    its improved recommendation knowledge to its new business) were the insights that
    has been gained from participating in the competition (and we can advance that
    knowledge will be also the leitmotiv of most of this book).'

  zh: Netflix竞赛基于改进现有协同过滤的想法，其目的是简单地根据用户对其他电影给出的先前评分来预测用户对电影的潜在评分，而不了解用户的具体身份或电影的具体内容。由于没有用户描述或电影标题或描述可用（所有这些都由身份代码替代），竞赛要求开发出智能的方法来使用可用的先前评分。只有当解决方案能够将现有的Netflix算法Cinematch改进到一定阈值以上时，才会分配价值100万美元的巨额奖金。该竞赛从2006年持续到2009年，最终由许多先前参赛团队的融合组成的一个团队获胜（来自Commendo
    Research & Consulting GmbH的一个团队，Andreas Töscher和Michael Jahrer，在Kaggle竞赛中也相当知名，AT&T
    Labs的两名研究人员和Yahoo!的两名其他研究人员）。最终，赢得竞赛需要如此多的计算能力和不同解决方案的集成，以至于团队不得不合并以保持竞争力。这种情况也反映在Netflix实际使用该解决方案上，Netflix更愿意不实施它，而是简单地从中提取最有趣的见解来改进其现有的Cinematch算法（你可以在这篇Wired文章中了解更多信息：[https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/)）。在Netflix竞赛的最终阶段，更重要的是解决方案本身，因为Netflix的业务已经从DVD转变为在线电影，解决方案很快就被取代了。对于参与者（他们在协同过滤中获得了巨大的声誉）和公司（可以将改进的推荐知识转移到其新业务中）来说，真正的益处是从竞赛中获得的见解（我们可以进一步说，这种知识也将是本书大部分内容的主题）。

- en: Kaggle took its first steps in February 2010 thanks to the idea of Anthony Goldbloom,
    an Australian trained economist (he has a degree in Economics and Econometrics
    from Melbourne University). After working at Australia's Department of Treasury
    and in the Research department at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Goldbloom worked
    in London as an intern at The Economist, the international weekly newspaper on
    current affairs, international business, politics, and technology. At The Economist
    he had occasion to write an article about big data that inspired his idea of building
    a competition platform that could crowdsource the best analytical experts in solving
    interesting machine learning problems ([https://www.smh.com.au/technology/from-bondi-to-the-big-bucks-the-28yearold-whos-making-data-science-a-sport-20111104-1myq1.html](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/from-bondi-to-the-big-bucks-the-28yearold-whos-making-data-science-a-sport-20111104-1myq1.html)).
    Since the crowdsourcing dynamics had a relevant part in the business idea for
    this platform, he derived the name Kaggle, which recalls by rhyme the term “gaggle”
    i.e. a flock of geese (the goose is also the symbol of the platform).

    At the moment, many of them are problems related to the application of deep learning

    tabular data competitions, that is competitions based on problems related to structured
    data that can be found in a database. Now such competitions are really less required
    because a crowdsourced solution would not often be such an advance in respect
    of what a good team of data scientists or even an autoML software could reach.
    First using random forests, then using gradient boosting methods with clever feature
    engineering, in the past tabular data solution derived from Kaggle could really
    largely improve a solution. Nowadays, given the spread of better software and
    good practices, the obtainable increased results from competitions could be indeed
    marginal. In the unstructured data world, instead, a good deep learning solution
    could still do the difference since, for instance, pretrained networks such as
    BERT brought about double-digit increases in previous standards of many well known

    described. More sophisticated, the two-stage competition splits the contested
    into two parts and the final dataset is released only after the first part has
    completed and only to the participants of the first phase. The two-stage competition
    format has emerged in order to limit the chance that some competitor may cheat
    and infringe the rules since the evaluation is done on a completely untried test
    set that it is available for a short time. For the same reason, also the Code
    competitions have recently appeared, where all submissions are made from a Kaggle

    David Donoho, professor of statistics at Stanford University ([https://web.stanford.edu/dept/statistics/cgi-bin/donoho/](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/statistics/cgi-bin/donoho/)),
    in his writing “50 Years of Data Science”. The paper has first appeared in the
    Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics and then subsequently posted
    on the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (see [http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf)).
    Professor Donoho does not refer to Kaggle specifically, but to all data science
    competition platforms generically. Quoting computational linguist Mark Liberman,
    he refers to data science competitions and platforms as part of a **Common Task
    Framework** (**CTF**) paradigm that has been silently and steadily progressing
    data science in many fields during the last decades. He states that a CTF can
    work incredibly well at improving the solution of a problem in data science from
    an empirical point of view. He quotes as successful examples the NetFlix competition
    and many DARPA competitions that have reshaped the best in class solutions for
    problems in many fields.

    until they reach an asymptote. The process can be speeded up by allowing a certain
    amount of sharing among participants (as it happens on Kaggle by means of discussions
    and sharing Kernel notebooks and extra data by Datasets). It can be noticed that

- en: This is because the secret sauce in the CTF paradigm is the competition itself,
    that, in the framework of a practical problem whose empirical performance has
    to be improved, always leads to the emergence of new benchmarks, new data and
    modeling solutions, and in general to an improved application of machine learning
    to the problem objected of the competition. A competition can therefore provide
    a new way to solve a prediction problem, new ways of feature engineering, new
    algorithmic or modeling solutions. For instance, deep learning has not simply
    emerged from academic research, but it has first gained a great boost because
    of successful competitions that declared its efficacy (we have already mentioned
    for instance the Merck competition won by Geoffrey Hinton’s team [https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners)).

  zh: 这是因为CTF范式中的秘密成分就是竞赛本身，在需要改进其实验性能的实践问题框架中，总是导致新基准、新数据和建模解决方案的出现，以及一般而言，将机器学习更好地应用于竞赛所针对的问题。因此，竞赛可以提供解决预测问题的新方法，新的特征工程方法，新的算法或建模解决方案。例如，深度学习并非仅仅来自学术研究，它首先因为成功竞赛而获得了巨大的推动力，这些竞赛宣布了其有效性（例如，我们已经提到了Geoffrey
    Hinton团队赢得的Merck竞赛[https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/overview/winners)）。
- en: 'Coupled with the open software movement, which allows everyone to access to
    powerful analytical tools (such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow or PyTorch), the
    CTF paradigm brings even better results because all competitors are on the same
    line at the start. On the other end, the reliance of a solution to a competition
    on specialized or improved hardware can limit the achievable results because it
    can prevent competitors without access to such resources to properly participate
    and contribute directly to the solution or indirectly by exercising competitive
    pressure on the other participants. Understandably, that the reason why Kaggle
    started also offering cloud services for free to participants to its competitions
    (the Kernels): it can flatten some differences in hardware intense competitions
    (like most deep learning ones are) and increase the overall competitive pressure.'

- en: 'Another problem is the possibility to probe a solution from the leaderboard.
    In such situation, you can snoop the solution by repeated submission trials on
    the leaderboard. Again, in this case the solution is completely unusable in different
    circumstances. A clear example of such happened in the competition “Don’t Overfit
    II” ([https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii)).
    In this competition, the winning participant, Zachary Mayers, submitted every
    individual variable as a single submission, gaining information on the possible
    weight of each variable that allowed him to estimate the correct coefficients
    for his model (you can read Zach’s detailed solution here: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii/discussion/91766](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii/discussion/91766)).
    Generally, time series problems (or other problems where there are systematic
    shifts in the test data) may be seriously affected by probing, since they can
    help competitors to successfully define some kind of ‘post-processing’ (like multiplying
    their predictions by a constant) that is most suitable for scoring high on the

    Mayers将每个单独的变量作为一个单独的提交，从而获得了关于每个变量可能权重的信息，这使他能够估计出他模型正确的系数（你可以在Zach的详细解决方案中阅读：[https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii/discussion/91766](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dont-overfit-ii/discussion/91766))。一般来说，时间序列问题（或测试数据中存在系统变化的其它问题）可能会受到探测的严重影响，因为它们可以帮助竞争者成功定义某种“后处理”（例如，将他们的预测乘以一个常数），这在特定的测试集中得分最高。
- en: 'Another form of leaderboard snooping happens when participants tend to rely
    more on the feedback from the public leaderboard than their own tests. Sometimes
    such turns into a complete failure of the competition, with a wild shake-up, that
    is a complete and unpredictable reshuffling of the competitors’ positions on the
    final leaderboard. The winning solutions, in such a case, may (but not always)
    turn out to be not so optimal for the problem or even sometimes just dictated
    by chance. This has led to precise analysis by competitors if the training set
    is much different from the test set they have to guess. Such analysis, called
    “Adversarial testing” can provide insight if to rely on the leaderboard and if
    there are features that are too different from the training and test set to be
    better avoided completely (For an example, you can have a look at this Kernel
    by Bojan Tunguz: [https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ieee](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ieee)).
    Another form of defense against leaderboard overfitting is choosing safe strategies
    to avoid submitting solutions too based on the leaderboard results. For instance,
    since two solutions are allowed to be chosen by each participant for the evaluation
    at the end of the competition, a good strategy is to submit the best one performing
    on the leaderboard and the best performing one based on one’s own cross-validation
    tests.'

  zh: 另一种排行榜窃密的形式发生在参与者倾向于更多地依赖公共排行榜的反馈而不是他们自己的测试时。有时这会导致比赛的完全失败，伴随着激烈的动荡，即最终排行榜上竞争者位置的完全不可预测的重新洗牌。在这种情况下，获胜的解决方案可能（但不总是）对问题不是那么优化，甚至有时可能只是由机会决定的。这导致竞争者对训练集与必须猜测的测试集差异很大进行了精确的分析。这种分析被称为“对抗性测试”，如果依赖排行榜，以及如果存在与训练集和测试集差异太大的特征，可以提供洞察（例如，你可以看看Bojan
    Tunguz的这个Kernel：[https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ieee](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/adversarial-ieee))）。另一种防止排行榜过拟合的防御方式是选择安全的策略来避免根据排行榜结果提交过多的解决方案。例如，由于每个参赛者允许选择两个解决方案在比赛结束时进行评估，一个好的策略是提交在排行榜上表现最好的一个和基于自己交叉验证测试表现最好的一个。
- en: In order to avoid problems with leaderboard probing and overfitting, Kaggle
    has recently introduced different innovations based on Code Competitions, where
    the evaluation is split into two distinct stages, that is you have a test set
    for the public leaderboard (the leaderboard you follow during the competition)
    and a completely hold out test set for the final private leaderboard. In this
    way, participants are actually blind to the actual data their solutions will be
    evaluated against and they should be forced to consider more their own tests and
    a more general solution against a solution specific to the test set.

- en: Finally, another possible distortion of a competition is due to private sharing
    (sharing ideas and solutions in a closed circle of participants) and other illicit
    moves such as playing by multiple accounts or playing in multiple teams and stealing
    ideas from each in favor of another team. All such actions create an asymmetry
    in information between participants that can be favorable to a few and detrimental
    to the most. Again, the resulting solution may be affected because sharing has
    been imperfect during the competition and fewer teams have been able to exercise
    full competitive pressure. Moreover, if such situations appear evident to participants
    (for instance see [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/discussion/122503](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/discussion/122503)),

    more than two machines with GPU running at the same time (10 machines at a time
    is the limit for the CPU only instances). Even if you can double your machine
    time by changing your code to leverage the usage of TPUs instead of GPUs (and
    you can find some guidance for achieving that easily here: [https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu)),
    that may still prove not enough for fast experimentation on a data heavy competitions
    such as the Deepfake Detection Challenge. That’s the reason in the chapter devoted
    to Kaggle Kernel we are going to provide you with many tips and tricks for successful
    coping with such limitations with decent results without having to buy a heavy

    GB的视频数据。这主要是因为每周使用时间的限制，在撰写本文时大约是每周30小时，以及你不能同时运行超过两台带有GPU的机器（对于仅CPU实例，一次最多10台）。即使你可以通过将代码改为利用TPU而不是GPU来加倍你的机器时间（你可以在以下位置找到一些实现该目标的简单指导：[https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu))，这仍然可能不足以在数据密集型竞赛如深度伪造检测挑战赛上进行快速实验。这就是为什么在关于Kaggle核的章节中，我们将为您提供许多技巧和窍门，以在无需购买高性能机器的情况下，以令人满意的结果成功应对这些限制。我们还将向您展示如何将Kaggle核与**Google

    really a lot of time and efforts when in competition (not to count in the specialty
    skills they put on that in truth are quite rare in the general population). The
    monetary prizes usually cover the efforts of the few top ones, if not of the only
    top one, leaving the rest with an astonishing amount of hours just voluntary spent
    for no return. On the long, being in competition with no tangible result may lead
    to disaffection and disinterest, thus lowering the competitive intensity. Hence,
    Kaggle has found at least a way to reward competitors with an honor system based
    on medals and points. The idea is that the more medals and the more points, the
    more relevant are ones skills, opening for opportunities in job search or any
    other relevant activity based on reputation.
